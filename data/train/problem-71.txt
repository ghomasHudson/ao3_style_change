He made his way out to his car, hoping John made it home before it started raining. He climbed into his car and started it. He decided he would just go the long way home to see if John made it there. He couldn’t keep it out of his mind.
John went to Sherlock’s room to ready to start another day of painting. This time he had a change of clothes just in case something happened before practice. He got in enough trouble the night before for bringing in a mess.
John shook his head. He couldn’t. His dad wouldn’t like that idea one bit. “I’ll be fine at school,” he said. “Plus I have practice to go to. Don’t want to miss one of those unless I want the coach on my back.”
"Here, let me take a few of those bags," John laughed, taking the bags from Sherlock. He smiled softly, nudging Sherlock. "Are we better?"
“My friends don’t have anything planned, I don’t even think they know it’s my birthday,” John murmured, looking down, his shoulders dropped. “If you don’t want to that’s fine.”
He pulled him closer, wanting to feel him, wanting to feel everything that he was feeling in that moment.
“Also try to remember what those guys look like,” Sherlock said. “I want to get them before they get someone else. Understand?”
Mr. Jamison sighed. “He inflicted harm unto another student, in the rules it says those who fight get suspended and lose any special privileges.”
John grinned and turned around, running into the small lake they stopped at. He dove into the icy cold water. When he resurfaced he let out a small yell. “Oh god, that’s cold,” he said. He looked at Sherlock who was laughing his butt off. “Come join me.”
John smiled and nodded once more. “See you tomorrow Mr. Holmes,” he said. He turned and ran from the room.
Hugo Watson watched as his son made his way over to him. His eyes traveling over his frame with a small smile. When he was close he decided to speak up, "You haven't been home in a while."
When Monday finally came Sherlock felt like crap but he knew he would have to push through the day. He was sitting at his desk, watching as the students filed in.
Sherlock watched as John hurried through the crowd. He frowned at that, wondering where he was going so quickly. Then he spotted the man that could only be John's dad. He had never met the man before. He didn't think now would be the best time to introduce himself as John's boyfriend. But as a teacher it would be fine.
“42 Hanson Road,” John told him as he buckled up. He sent a quick text to his dad telling him he was on his way. “It seems like another early morning tomorrow.”
John sighed but otherwise stayed silent. His eyes were flickering from one item on the menu to the next.
Sherlock laughed more. He saw a man peek out the window. “I think your father sees you,” he said. “Better get inside.”
She nodded. “I’ll try what I can, I’ll call your father John,” she said. “You’re getting hurt too much around here.”
Sherlock nodded and looked to John’s house. “I’ll see you in class tomorrow,” he said. “If you’re not sick that is.”
John nodded and pulled his arm away as he got up. He went to the car and slipped inside easily. He kept his head down and waited for his teacher to come in.
John was stripping down to his boxers as Sherlock leaned against the hood of the car. “Come on Mr. Holmes, it will be fun,” he told him. He folded his clothes and set them next to his teacher. “It’s just a quick swim.”
Sherlock reached over and brought his ear forward. “You should, it looks like you’re growing fungus back there.”
John looked up at him, his smile grinning up at him. “Really?” he asked. “Oh thank you. Thank you so much. We can go after school tomorrow right?”
Sherlock pressed his hand against his chest when he tried to get up. “No, lets stay in bed for a bit more. Time doesn’t pass while we’re here.”
There was a substitute there and Sherlock relieved her of her duties. He took his seat behind his desk as he got his things ready for the class. The students started talking once again and Sherlock clenched his hands into fists. “Quiet, all of you,” he yelled. “I don’t want to hear a single peep from you lot or I’ll give you all detention.”
John slowly pulled away, opening his eyes with a smile on his face. “Wow,” he whispered, looking over at him. “That was….wow.”
The teacher took back his hand, dropping it to his side. He didn’t know what he was doing. He didn’t want to push the boy away anymore. “Is your father coming to get you?” he questioned, scanning the injuries that he could see.
John sighed and sat up. “Alright,” he said, stretching. He licked his lips and yawned. “Are you coming to the match tomorrow?”
`He was starting to worry again but tried to push it out of his mind. He tried to listen to the teens’ conversations but John’s name never came up. He found it odd to think that none of his friend’s knew about his whereabouts.
Early the next morning John stood in front of his father’s house. He had left Sherlock with a note that said he would be back before their breakfast date.
Sherlock shut his eyes and pulled up a chair to sit next to John. “I’ll stay with him then until he wakes up,” he told them. “Thank you.”
When he opened the door he stopped short, surprised to see another student in the room. He stopped short, staying where he was as he watched the other student. He didn’t know who he was. Sherlock glanced to John, letting a small smile pass over his face. “Come in, Mr. Watson, I’ll be with you in just a moment.”
Sherlock started driving, watching out of the corner of his eye as John slowly fell asleep. He smiled and leaned back with a happy sigh.
Sherlock laughed a bit when John waved towards him and waved back as well. He shook his head, sitting back against the fence at the top of the stands. The match started and although he was lost Sherlock still cheered whenever the crowd did.
John was quick in getting to his room after the last bell rang. Sherlock wasn’t even done packing up when the teen came into the room. “Hello Mr. Watson,” he said, a small smirk on his lips. “I’ll be with you in just a moment. I have to get a few more things together.”
Why? Why doesn’t he want him to help? What was the other thinking? There were so many questions that were hanging in the air. Sherlock hated that.
Now though, John was sitting in the auditorium waiting for his row to go up. He looked around at the group of teachers and grinned when he saw Sherlock.
Sherlock glanced over at him. “I don’t know,” he said. He rubbed his eyes and sighed. “It was just…one of those days I guess.”
John fell asleep on the way home, exhausted from the week he had. He was shaken awake and he opened his eyes too look over at Sherlock. “What?” he asked rubbing his eyes.
“Not quite, you’ll have a week left,” Sherlock pointed out as he drove to the restaurant. “One long week.”
"Actually, I'm seeing someone," John told her with a small laugh.  "He's waiting for me too so I'm sorry but I have to go."
Sherlock arrived at the school a bit later than normal, it wasn’t a good night and it wasn’t a good morning. He stopped by the office to tell them that he was there before heading to his class. He wasn’t looking forward to it.
"You're not being selfish, trust me this is something everyone worries about," John told him. "I don't want to be deployed as much as you don't want me to. But if it happens then I will take it and I will do it with as much pride and courage as I can. The army will train me to become a better person, to be able to fight. I will be fine."
Sherlock grabbed his foot and yanked him back. “Not yet Mr. Watson,” he said. He dragged him under and started to run as fast as he could in water back to the warm shore.
Sherlock laughed and went to sit next to him, sliding further up on the car so he was leaning back against the windshield. “Sounds good,” he said with a small smile.
John’s face fell a bit as he looked out at the house. He chewed the inside of his lip before undoing his seatbelt. “Thank you, Mr. Holmes.”
“Can you please talk to me?” Sherlock asked. “I have less than a day with you left and I don’t want it to be had in complete silence.”
“Fine, fine,” Sherlock said, holding up his hands. “I’m just worried. My favorite student was knocked out.”
The rest of the day went the same way; Sherlock made every one of his students stay silent with a threat of detention. With the stern look from the teacher no one let a single word slip all class.
Sherlock groaned and moved to lie down on his back. “Don’t say that. I really don’t want you to leave.”
Sherlock stared after John after he pulled his arm away. John must have known what he wanted to do, what he had been thinking about for so long. He must have been mortified. He slowly moved to the car and got in. He pulled off the side and started towards John’s house.
“Hello Mr. Watson,” Sherlock said, not looking up from the papers he was working on. He had calmed down a bit from before. He had pushed down the weird feeling and pulled himself together.
“I fought back,” John said. “Sir, I was on the ground and they were kicking me, ask Mr. Holmes. I came in with a nearly broken nose and a few good bruises myself. I would never just randomly beat someone up.”
John raised an eyebrow and silently wondered what was wrong with his teacher but he didn’t let it get to him too much. He started to put his things away, still talking about his date with Sarah.
John grinned and started to wipe the water from his body, shaking heavily. “I’m going to be soaked still but oh well,” he murmured as he handed the blanket over and pulled on his clothes. “Warm.”
He turned to run back out but John caught him around the waist and pulled him in further. “You’re in now,” he told him. “You just have to go under.”
The next few days went by in a blur. John dedicated his last days to spending time with Sherlock. They went to museums, an aquarium, out to eat, and anywhere that they wanted to go. It was their time to spend together and there was nothing that was going to stop them.
Sherlock couldn’t keep the proud smile from his face. “Good on you,” he said as he opened the door to the nurses office. No one seemed to be there. He sighed and shook his head. “Never here when you need them.” He looked around as he tried to find something to stop the bleeding from John’s nose. He grabbed what looked like gauze and handed it to the teen. “I suggest you go home after this. Get some rest.”
“Yeah, you do,” Sherlock whispered, reaching over and wiping some ice cream from his cheek. He smiled, bring his finger to his lips and licking it gently. “All better.”
Sherlock raised an eyebrow before shaking his head. He stood up once he was done and grabbed his jacket. “Let’s go,” he hummed before leading him out of the room.
Sherlock licked his lips and nodded. “Yeah, you can stay over,” he said, pressing a kiss to his forehead. “Of course you can. I can’t kick you out.” He pressed a kiss to his lips.
He didn't hear the rest of the conversation but he saw John coming over to him. "Hey, sorry about that," he said softly, putting the food on the belt. "She caught me and I couldn't get away."
“Oh yes, you turning blue is really making me want to join you,” Sherlock said. “No, I’ll let you get it out of your system.”
“You too Mr. Watson,” Sherlock said. The door was shut seconds later and the man couldn’t take his eyes off the student as he walked into his house. He sighed softly, trying to collect himself once again. He hated watching that man walk away. After a few moments of just watching the house he pulled himself together and drove away.
John got the ball, feet hitting the ground as hard as they could as he ran towards the end goal. Evading tacklers was getting harder and he couldn’t see anyone to pass too. Someone dove in front of him and he jumped over him only to be caught by a tackler.
On the other hand John was worried about his teacher, which then brought him to the fact that he still had detention. He had a feeling that it would be awkward during that detention. Sherlock just didn’t seem like himself and John had gotten so used to just hanging out with him.
Sherlock waited until John was out of sight before leaving the airport. He headed home to a flat that hadn’t been empty in months.
He felt like fireworks were going off in his head. This was amazing. The first kiss with the man he had been thinking about for so long.
Sherlock helped him to the nurse’s office, sure that the nurse would be able to take care of him. He laid him down on the bed and ran his fingers over his forehead. “She’ll take care of you,” he whispered before the nurse came in.
Instead of answering the question Sherlock said, “I was enjoying seeing you so relaxed,” he admitted. He nuzzled against his neck, humming softly.
It was just getting dark when they found something that might be fun. Or well it was John’s idea really; Sherlock wouldn’t have ever done anything like it unless someone was forcing him to do it. That’s exactly what John was doing.
John has to admit that he had butterflies in his stomach. He was nervous about graduating for some reason. Sherlock helped him get dressed into a suit that he bought him and told him how proud he was.
Sherlock let out a small sigh, knowing that John had a rough relationship with his father. He didn’t know what caused their problems and he didn’t want to ruin the night by bringing it up. “Alright,” he smiled. “I’m happy you chose me to be your birthday companion.”
John nodded, trying his best to keep the smile from his face. Sherlock was becoming his favorite teacher and fast. “I’ve been trying to think of who mugged me yesterday sir,” he said. “I got a face in my head but no name.”
“I know,” Sherlock told him as he knelt with him on the floor. “I’m going to try to get you a smaller punishment. You don’t deserve what they get.”
John rolled his eyes. "No, someone else decided they were going to take my heart," he laughed softly. He looked over at him, smiling. He spotted Sarah again and she came to their line.
Without a word John opened the door and left the car. His heart was pounding and he felt like he might throw up. What was wrong with him?
John thought for a moment, licking his lips. “Do you remember that restaurant you took me after my match?” he asked.
Sherlock squeezed his shoulder gently. “You better be,” he said. He gave him a smile and nodded toward the house. “You better get going. You’re tired and need to relax some.”
John ran out onto the field, feeling great about the game they were about to play. He scanned the stands before the match started, spotting Sherlock at the end. He grinned like an idiot, giving him a small wave.
Sherlock nodded, putting a hand on his shoulder. "It will be okay," he assured him. "Come on, lets go home. I have a surprise."
Sherlock couldn't help but laugh gently. "How are you acting like the adult when I'm here being selfish?"
In a much more soothing voice Sherlock said his name again, leaning closer. “I want to help. Please.”
Sherlock smiled and slipped from the hood. “Come on then,” he said, slipping into his car. John got in soon after him, a grin splitting his face. “So, good night so far?”
John shut his eyes and thought for a moment. Sherlock could see the inner turmoil working and knew that if he said yes it would be a reluctant yes. “Please,” John whispered. He couldn’t walk home in his condition even if he tried.
“Sir, it’s all he has,” Sherlock said. “Give him a lesser punishment. I’ll take him on, give him detention. Have him help out around the school. Just let him play out his last three games here.”
When he pulled back John was just staring down at him. He didn’t have to say it. Neither of them did. They both loved each other and knew that there was no going back.
John nodded, moving to take a seat. He watched the two interact before the other teen left. John dropped his head back and let out a groan. “Finally, we can go,” he said, pushing himself up from the desk. “I’m starving.”
Once they were there John hurried inside, ordering the biggest cone he could get. Sherlock laughed as he watched the cone being handed over to John. “You will never finish that,” he told him, ordering his own cone.
John followed close behind him as they made their way to the car. “My birthday is this Friday,” he told him.
“I know, I heard,” Mike laughed. He clapped his hand on his shoulder. “I’m just so happy for you John. You’ve been single forever.”
“It will be okay,” Sherlock whispered quietly, cupping his cheek now. “I will be here when you get back and I will follow you wherever I can.” He kissed him again and felt his chest fill with love for the teen in his arms.
John hurried to make it up to Sherlock’s classroom. He didn’t want to be late on his first day to detention. He knocked on the door before slipping in. “Mr. Holmes,” he said, smiling when he saw him behind his desk packing up his back. “I’m ready for whatever you want me to do.”
Sherlock shook his head and shoved the cup holding all his pens off his desk. “Useless,” he muttered and left the office.
John laughed and stopped outside Sherlock’s door. He bit his lip and looked up at Sherlock for a moment. “Thank you Mr. Holmes,” he murmured. He opened the door and went back to his seat.
Over the past few months they had spent most of the time together. When John went out Sherlock would usually stay in and work on the next years lesson plan. He was already planning on how to visit John once he got to the school the army was sending him to. He could visit him on the weekend once he had time, help him study, distract him from studying. Sherlock was planning on being a bit selfish. But only for a little while.
“Say something like that again and I’ll kick you out,” Sherlock grinned as he drove away from the house.
John sent a glare over at him before he motioned for him to come over. "Yes, I need my Sherlock," he mumbled. "And I want to get out and do something."
Sherlock had stopped writing and looked up at John. “A date is not a reason to miss your punishment Mr. Watson,” he said. “You know that.”
Sherlock didn't take his eyes off John. Ah; the army. Of course. How could he not see? John looked ashamed, shrugging a bit. "Yeah, well it will be okay," he said softly. "If it happens it happens." He licked his lips. "I'm going to go outside and see if my ride is here. I'll see you two tomorrow."
Sherlock had been working for the past few hours, grading papers and reading essays. He knew John was growing bored but that's why he was doing it. They were the finals from all his classes, the last he had to do. The more he got done now the more time he could spend with John during the day and that night. He already had something special planned for after his graduation. It was going to be something they both wanted to do for a while.
John smiled and slipped out of the car. “Thank you Mr. Holmes,” he said. “I know you are tired of hearing it but this is the last time. I swear.”
Sherlock nodded, shifting his hand to the wheel. He needed to think. This was ridiculous. When he pulled the car to a stop by the park he turned to John. "What if you get deployed?" He asked quietly.
John laughed and shook his head. “I know what I’m doing tonight,” he mumbled. “Thanks for the heads up Mr. Holmes.” He walked out of the nurse’s office feeling slightly better than before. At least he didn’t have blood gushing down his face now. “Am I allowed to warn the others?” he asked over his shoulder.
Sherlock’s arms were around him again, loving and warm. It caused John to press into him, his head pressed against his chest.
John swallowed hard; the way Sherlock looked right now, smiling at him like he knew every answer in the world. “Brilliant,” he whispered. He licked his lips and glanced down to Sherlock’s lips. They were so close. All he had to do was lean forward and he would taste them, feel them. They looked soft.
“I’m sure your friends would not enjoy you spending your eighteenth birthday with me,” Sherlock said, shaking his head. He was doing his best to keep himself in check. He didn’t want to be too excited that John wanted to spend another night out with him.
John looked out the window at his house and nodded. “Yeah, I’ll be squeaky clean,” he said as he unbuckled his seat belt. He didn’t move from his seat though as he looked at his house.
"Then I get deployed," John answered, his shoulder's sagging a bit. "Deployment doesn't mean death. It just means time away. I know that will be hard but we can do it." He took Sherlock's hand again, kissing it gently. "I promise everything will be okay."
By the end of their detention the two of them were covered in paint sitting against the wall laughing. “I told you, you shouldn’t have put the can up on the ladder,” John laughed.
John climbed out of the quickly and led him into the restaurant. He moved to the table that they sat at last time and settled into his seat. “I don’t either,” he said. “I enjoy our time together.”
John looked over at his dad and didn't even notice when they were congratulated for doing such a great job. When they were told they were free to go John quickly got up and went to go see his father.
If only John's dad cared as much as Sherlock did. Though, if he did John probably wouldn't have spent so much time with Sherlock and they would have never ended up together. John was grateful for that.
He knocked his knuckles on the dark wood of the desk. He laughed when Sherlock nearly jumped right out of his chair. ”You know, for someone who is so observant you’re easy to scare,” he giggled.
"Wait," she said. "Before you go. Um....would you like to go out again sometime?" She bit her lip, tugging on her sleeve. "I think it will go a lot better this time."
This included spending time with the man that seemed to steal his heart. It was going to be easier for them. The last few weeks at school were rough, they barely spoke and when they did they made sure it was school friendly.
Sherlock knew that everything was going to be alright. They had a time before John left. They were going to grow closer together and things were going to be just fine.
Sherlock nodded and stood up. “Get changed for bed, we can pop in a movie. Relax some,” he said, pecking his lips.
Without a word he sat down and looked over at his student. “You’re going to get sick,” he told him quietly.
“Yeah,” John sighed, rubbing Sherlock’s side. “I’m not going home though. He can’t control me.” He sat up and kissed his cheek. “It’s getting late. Should we go to bed?”
His stupid date with the girl. Taking in another deep breath Sherlock calmed down. He marched to the auditorium and decided that would be it.
At the end of the day Sherlock packed up his things, wondering how he was going to get through the ride to John’s place without making things worse between them. That’s all he was worried about. He didn’t want John to hate him for his own problems. There was something bad about that.
His row stood up and he gave him a wink before he started to move. He balled his hands into fists to try to stop himself from fiddling with them. He moved across the stage, looking across the crowd. He spotted his dad and his step faltered a bit.
John looked up at him, shaking from the cold. “What are y-you doing here?” he asked, clenching his hands into fists.
Sherlock raised an eyebrow and smiled. “Yes, I believe we can be on a first name basis by now,” he said with a small nod.
He only came into the world again when he saw Sherlock standing in front of him with a worried look on his face. He spoke but the words didn’t reach John’s ears.
“He said something about you taking him home,” the nurse hummed, tapping her pen against a note pad.
"Of course I was going to show up, you're my son and I thought it would be best if I were here;" he told him. "Why wouldn't I be here?"
Sherlock let his eyes slide close, titling his head to the side. However, John didn't continue and he was a bit disappointed. "I suppose we can do that," he said as he stood up. He turned around, pulling John into a kiss. He ran his fingers through his hair, holding him there for a moment before pulling away. "Alright, go get dressed," he said softly. He slapped his arse before he went to go get his jacket. He smiled softly, pulling it on and checking his pockets.
“You’re the one that likes spending time with me,” Sherlock reminded him. He pulled up to the restaurant, shutting off the car and climbing out. “Not that I mind really.”
John rolled his eyes, letting Sherlock lead the way out. “I’m joining the army. I won’t have time to worry about what I would be doing without you,” he told him.
“Positive,” John said. “It’s the same hair, the smile. And that’s his friend, the one with the black eye.”
John nodded a little, letting his eyes slide shut as he rested against him. “Do you…can you just hold me for the rest of the night? I don’t want to be away from you.”
John smiled, looking over at him. “Thanks for agreeing to spend another night with your student,” he hummed softly.
Sherlock didn’t see John until Friday. The teen was out on Thursday, Sherlock had to believe he was sick. When Friday rolled around he didn’t see John in class.
John rolled his eyes, huffing out a laugh. "Sure you are," he muttered. "We were just talking about how I'm moving out."
John looked up at him, his eyes wide as he tried to calm down. “I…I…I don’t have anything else,” he huffed. He slowly sat down on the floor. “Rugby is all I have. There are only three games left. I was just defending myself.”
“Are you sure you want to pass this in Mr. Watson?” Sherlock asked, glancing up to him. With the firm nod he received he raised an eyebrow. “Good. I love the confidence. You may have a seat.” He watched John move back to his seat, noticing that he wasn’t limping at all and that most of the bruises were already fading. He smiled a bit before going about grading the student’s paper.
“You’re welcome,” Sherlock told him. “Next game I don’t want to run after you into the locker rooms.”
John let out a small laugh and nodded. “I hate when my body thinks it wants something but my mind doesn’t,” he said. He started picking small bits of thrash from the floor. “Mike was rather disappointed that things didn’t go well.”
John was quiet for a while and Sherlock thought he wasn’t going to speak again. He was going to say something but then the teen spoke up. “That sounds lovely,” he whispered. “Thank you.”
They were kissing again and Sherlock couldn’t be happier. Though he cut this one short, putting a hand on John’s chest “Let’s go somewhere more private,” he told him “My place? Unless you want to go home.”
Sherlock nodded. “I’m going to take a long shower after this,” he said. He tried not to focus on how John felt comfortable enough to pull something from his hair.
"Oh, I know exactly what we'll need for this," John told him with a smile, his hand feeling empty now. He hated having to hide. He shoved his hands in his pockets. It was a lot weirder to see them holding hands than it was just to be with him. He was okay with it. One more day and they would be fine. That's all they needed.
The moment that was over too soon. His lips hurt slightly when John pulled away but he didn’t care. Especially when he saw the tears falling from the other’s eyes. Gently he reached up and wiped them away.
“It was my pleasure,” Sherlock said. He led him back to the car. “You should sleep well tonight, after a shower of course.”
“Oh my god,” Sherlock said, dropping his coffee and hurrying over to him. He had a black eye, split lip, the way he was limping Sherlock was sure his leg was hurting him, and John was guarding his ribs. “What happened?”
John grinned. “I’ll try to be more careful,” he said. He looked down at his feet before nodding. “Goodbye,” he mumbled, shutting the door. He quickly ran inside.
They were silent on the way there; they couldn’t even hear the other breathing. Sherlock wished he could say something. Maybe a sorry would do but then he would have to admit what he was thinking to John.
The final bell rang and Sherlock sighed in relief. It was the end of the week and he wouldn’t have to see any of his students over the weekend. He couldn’t ask for anything better at the moment. He was packing his things when there was a knock on the door. He raised an eyebrow. No one ever stayed after on Fridays. “Come in,” he called.
Sherlock didn’t understand anything about the game of rugby and he wasn’t sure why he told John he was going to make it. He knew exactly why. John had that charming smile that made Sherlock give him anything you want. It was a rather big downfall for a teacher that was supposed to be so cold to his students.
John Watson, you scored a one hundred. Higher than I expected I must say. I’m proud of you. Please remain after class so we can talk about your reward.”
Sherlock's head snapped around, his eyes narrowing at John. Leave? Why was he leaving? He wanted to ask but he was sure it would end in a fight. Mostly because Sherlock would make it end in a fight somehow.
Sherlock raised an eyebrow. That raised his curiosity more than it should have. “I’m sure if it’s bothering you I would want to know.”
John shook his head. “Well, you can leave,” he said. He wiped his nose and looked down the street. “I’m going to be leaving soon anyway.”
John grinned and cheered quietly before packing his bag away and moving to the front desk. He watched the other students file out, a few giving him glares as they left.
Sherlock nodded. “Come on, let me take you to the nurse,” he whispered. He wrapped an arm around his shoulders gently. “I’ll talk with the principle about this. I promise.”
Sherlock glanced from his papers as he listened to the two boys. John had a date? Well good for him. His stomach twisted though as he kept listening to the conversation. He couldn’t pinpoint why he had that feeling but it wasn’t a good one to have.
John gave him a sheepish smile. “Not to do it,” he mumbled. “It’s a bad habit of mine. I’ll try to stop.”
For the remainder of class John tried to catch up on his reading. He didn’t have much time to do homework after school because of practice then his chores at home.  When the bell rang John jumped from his seat and headed for the door.
He pulled up to the house and parked the car. “Mr. Watson,” he said, unsure as to what he was going to say. John looked to him and frowned slightly. Sherlock let out a deep breath and looked to him. “I was having fun hanging out with you, I don’t say that often, especially about a student.”
“Anytime,” Sherlock said. He paused. “Well, not really anytime. If we frequent here too much then people might get suspicious.”
“I told you, I don’t need help. So please, keep your opinions to yourself,” John said, his voice rougher than it usually was. He hadn’t meant to sound so harsh, but it was already out there. He didn’t want to say anything else, so he just left it there.
They were left alone. Sherlock let out a deep breath he didn’t know he was holding and gently ran his fingers over John’s forehead.
It was a half hour later when John emerged from the bathroom. His eyes were red and puffy. It, broke Sherlock’s heart to see him like that.
Sherlock smiled and opened the door. His hand slipped from John's, letting it fall to his side. "So, do you know what we may need?" He asked with a smile.
“Yes sir,” John said with a nod. He looked down at his feet for a moment before looking back up at Sherlock. “Thank you sir, you helped a lot today.”
John rolled his eyes, nudging him. “It would not have been funny,” he laughed. He paused. “Maybe it would have been.”
After a few moments Sherlock stood up. He needed to get the work done for the upcoming play. He was sure if he worked hard enough he would forget John and his date.
Sherlock shook his head, wiping the paint from his hair. “I’ll have to buy a new can of blue now,” he mumbled. He looked over at John and started laughing again.
He stared at the familiar door, wondering if he could still just walk in. He knew he had said horrible things to his father the last time they spoke, but he just didn’t feel right going off without actually speaking with him.
A waiter came by and took their orders. John sat back and smiled at Sherlock. He couldn’t believe he was doing something with his teacher for yet another night. Not that he minded. He enjoyed spending time with Sherlock more than anything else at the moment.
When John finished though he looked over at Sherlock with a smile. “What?” he asked, noticing him watching him. “Do I have something on my face?”
Sherlock nodded, leaving the auditorium, he would clean everything later. He didn’t want John to get in trouble either.
Sherlock smiled as he watched him go. He turned back to the work and happily painted until it he thought he had done enough for the day.
As he shut the door, he noticed a paper on the front step that he hadn’t noticed before. Slowly he bent down and snatched it from the stone.
Sherlock closed his eyes. How could he forget that? “You can borrow some of my pants,” he told him and brought him to the bedroom. He found bottoms for him and handed them over. “Change into these.”
Sherlock couldn't help but smile. He moved out of their sights before heading to the checkouts. It wouldn't be good if she saw him and John together.
John looked at Sherlock, relaxing just a bit. "Thank you, sir," he said softly. He threw a glance to his dad. "This is my famous father," he muttered, motioning to him.
When they got to the flat Sherlock unlocked the door and let John in first. The teen made his way up the stairs, smiling softly. “Make yourself at home,” Sherlock told him as he placed his things by the door.
“I think I can do something about that,” Sherlock said. “How about we go out to eat for some Chinese?”
John smiled, leaning into his side as his head spun. “Thanks,” he said. “Do you think there’s some pain meds in here?”
John nodded, turning on his heels to hide the frown forming on his face. “Have a nice night sir,” he said before leaving.
Sherlock let out a small sigh but nodded. He moved closer to John, pressing a kiss to his lips before he got out of the car. He grabbed the bags and waited for John to join him.
Sherlock pulled out a small note book and wrote down John’s name in it. He bit his lip and sat back. This was going to be interesting.
That was right. John was on the rugby team. He could tell by the look on John’s face he wasn’t going to get anywhere with his words. “Fine,” he murmured. “You don’t have to go but I want you to take it easy.”
John nodded and slowly unbuckled. He wished he didn’t have to get out of the car. “I’ll see you tomorrow,” he said quietly.
The students stared at him before they started talking amongst themselves. Sherlock could see a few students planning what they would get from the teacher but he knew they wouldn’t come close. “Okay, everything off the desks, just a pencil.” He started passing out the test, counting how many students would fail the test as he passed.
John laughed softly as Sarah told him about how her dog woke her up that morning. She caught him while he was looking over the chips and they had been talking ever since.
“I’m going to be taking a long shower whether I get dirty here of not,” John laughed as he turned to look at their work for the day. “I’m going to be leaving early today, don’t forget.”
“Oh, is it?” Sherlock asked as he slipped into the car. He buckled up and waited for John to get ready. “That’s good.”
“How long do I have detention?” John asked as he took off his school sweater. He set it off to the side and started looking over the set pieces.
John stopped at his desk again. “Sorry for not telling you about the paint in your hair earlier,” he said.
John moved beside him and leaned against the desk. “I’m done picking up,” he told him with a smile. “We can head out now.”
John squeezed Sherlock’s hand tightly as he looked ahead of him. He knew he would start crying again if he looked at the other. “I’ll send you the details of graduation as soon as I get them. I will write as much as I can. The recruiter will give…will give you the information to send letters to. I don’t know if I’ll receive them right away…”
Sherlock rolled his eyes, sitting down in the seat. “I should be pulling out your chair, you’re the birthday boy,” he laughed.
They kissed until they had no breath left and Sherlock was the one to break it again. He pressed their foreheads together, smiling like an idiot. “Oh my god,” he said softly. “I can’t believe this is happening. You have no idea how long I’ve wanted this.”
John pushed himself up as well, sitting next to him. He closed his eyes and started licking his ice cream again.
“Hello Mr. Watson,” Sherlock smiled. He noticed John’s nervousness but didn’t say anything about it. “Just have a seat and we’ll be out of here before you know it. I don’t have much more today and we can leave early.”
John had to stop thinking like that too. He could just blame it on teenage hormones. That sounded like a great thing to blame wanting to kiss his teacher on. He wanted to do so much more though.
Sherlock shook John awake, trying to be as gentle as he could. John sat up and rubbed his eyes as he looked around. “Oh, we’re here,” he murmured. He looked to Sherlock. “Thanks for the ride Mr. Holmes, and thank you for letting me sleep.”
Sherlock smiled and leaned back in his chair. He couldn’t get angry at the teen. He was just having a good time. His smile and laugh were great things to hear. He shook his head and shut his eyes. He shouldn’t be thinking that.
Soon both of them were back at the car, shivering and wet. John had his arms wrapped tightly around his chest trying to preserve his warmth. “Who’s idea was that?” he asked, laughing quietly.
They were having their last dinner together at the restaurant they had first gone to when they had started to hang out.
Sherlock sighed as he started driving. “I’m sorry,” he told him. He was truly sorry. He really didn’t want the boy to get in trouble at all, at home or at school. “I’ll help you with any homework tomorrow.”
Sherlock rolled his eyes and thanked the girl behind the counter for the cone before looking at John. “Where are we going to sit?” he questioned the younger man.
“May I ask you something?” John asked, looking over at him. He let a soft smile fall across his face as he saw the look on Sherlock’s face. He got a small hum for permission. “What was bothering you yesterday and this morning?”
It was sad. He wanted to remember it for something more. For his mother’s homemade cookies, or her warm inviting hugs.
Sherlock laughed. “I’m not but I really don’t care at the moment,” he said. “A student is in need and I stay after most often anyway.”
“Mr. Watson,” Sherlock’s voice traveled easily across the room. “Would you mind explaining to me why you are late?” His eyes narrowing as he looked at the seventeen year old. John wasn’t as rowdy and rambunctious as the other students were. Sherlock didn’t mind him as much as he did the other students.
“Then I’ll make you,” John laughed as he lifted him up. “Hold your breath.” He fell back with him and brought him under.
It didn’t take long for John to fall asleep, snoring quietly. Sherlock glanced down at him when he heard the noises and smiled. He never thought he would get to see the young man so peaceful. He settled his head back down and fell asleep soon after.
For the rest of the day John was trying to push away the thoughts of Sherlock. It was just so bloody hard. He wanted to just pull the man close and kiss him like he’s never been kissed before.
"Oh yeah, I forgot you told me," Sarah said with a smile. "It's still scary I think. What if you get sent off?"
Sherlock grinned. “Thank you,” he said. “You won’t regret it. Honestly.” He turned quickly and left the room.
The next Wednesday John moved into the classroom, going to Sherlock’s desk. The past week had been great. John had stayed after to talk with Sherlock and rode home with him every day. He was spending more time with his teacher than his friends.
John smiled gratefully and took the pills and water. “Alright, let’s leave now,” he mumbled throwing the cup away.
Sherlock nodded, trying not to look disappointed. “Yes, great fun. We’ll do it again sometime. I promise.”
Sherlock rolled his eyes, pushing him gently as he took the chocolate. He leaned over and pecked his lips before he opened the chocolate. "Thank you," he said softly.
“What?” Banks asked, turning to look at the teacher. His eyes landed on John. “Oh, god.” He turned and they made their way to the office.
Sherlock watched him go in with a frown. He started the car again and drove away. He had to just forget about this. It wouldn’t be any good for him to keep thinking like this about his student.
“Hey, I took one already,” John stated in his defense. “It’s just the showers at the school aren’t that well without proper soap.”
John shook his head. “Not a single bit of it,” he said. “I was on my way to the bus stop when they tugged me and started beating the crap out of me.”
John nodded. “Of course sir,” he said. “I’ll make sure to your liking. I’ll even get behind my ears.”
“I will,” John said, licking the cone. He leaned against the counter, watching him with a smirk. “You know my stomach is almost endless.”
“I do stink,” John murmured as he sniffed his shirt. “I promise I’ll take one before school on Monday.”
John’s phone began buzzing and it caused John to pull away with groan. He looked at the message he got, his father, and groaned again. He tossed his phone to the side. There was no way he was going home. Sherlock sat up, watching John as he tossed his phone away. “Dad?” he asked.
They ate mostly in silence. When Sherlock was done the bill was brought over and he lay down a bit of cash. “You ready to go home now?” he asked.
“I finished that work already,” Sherlock muttered. He glanced at his student, seeing the hurt in his eyes. “I’ll let you go. Surely you want to spend time with Sally? No Sarah.”
John smiled at his teacher as he ordered, unable to take his eyes off the man. He licked his lips, smiling softly. Though when he turned back John turned to look away. He didn’t want to get caught staring.
Sherlock let out a small giggle and nodded. “Yes, she was great at up selling the noodles.” He started driving towards John’s house. “We must do it again sometime before school ends.”
Sherlock nodded, moving silently over to John. He gently touched his shoulder. “John, wake up,” he said quietly. “Come on, time to get you home.”
Mr. Jamison was quiet for a moment, biting his lip as he thought. “Fine,” he sighed. “He can play out the last three games but he has detention with you for the rest of this week.”
“Yes I do sir but I already said yes,” John said. “I’ll do something for you next week. Please just this once let me go.”
John nodded. “The best,” he laughed softly. He reached over and took Sherlock’s hand as they started driving. “Thank you.”
When the bell rang Sherlock had all the papers graded already. He stood up, holding his hand up to stop the students from leaving. “I’m rather disappointed in most of you. I was expecting more people to pass. Honestly. You will know if you have to retake the test if I hand you your paper on the way out. I want you to review it and study. You’ll be taking the test again tomorrow.
Sherlock gently ran his fingers over John’s back as the teen slept. It was their last week together. Sherlock couldn’t believe the summer had gone so fast. It felt like graduation was only a day before and they had months together.
Sherlock didn’t like the feeling John gave him when he thought of him. So John would be pushed out of his thoughts unless it was during school hours.
John grinned, kissing him back. He pulled him closer, letting out a small sigh. He didn’t stop it this time, letting Sherlock do as he pleased.
He didn't even know that the man knew the graduation date. He quickly pushed himself of of his trance and hurried off the stage. Soon he was back in his seat and he wanted it to be over with quickly.
Sherlock nodded and grabbed his bag before leaving the room. He was silent as they made their way to the car. Unlocking the doors he glanced at John before getting in. Soon they were on the road again.
John bit his lip and nodded. “I did too, Mr. Holmes,” he said. He tugged on his fingers. “Thank you for the rides home.”
Sherlock laughed and nodded. “Of course I do,” he said. “Everyone doesn’t think that we know what goes on when we leave the room. No work gets done. That’s why I’m going to quiz everyone on it tomorrow.”
Sherlock nodded once again. “Yes, they must not like when the best student in the class gets the best grade. Bunch of idiots if you ask me.”
John grinned and pulled Sherlock into a hug. “Thank you, Mr. Holmes,” he said. He quickly unbuckled and jumped out of the car.
John smiled, wrapping his arms around his waist and pulling him closer. He wasn’t going to argue with Sherlock that this was one of the best things they could be doing. It felt too nice to not be doing it really.
When John came back out he held out his jacket for him. John kissed his cheek before pulling it on. "Where should we go out to eat?" He asked with a small hum.
Sherlock smiled. “Exactly,” he said. He picked up the tools he was given. “You hold them up and I knock in these nails?”
Sherlock watched him go, letting out a low groan when he was finally left alone. He covered his face with his hands, trying to sort out his head.
John smiled. “That sounds really boring, but fitting,” he laughed quietly. He stood up as well, biting his lip. “I don’t have clothes.”
“Why did you park so far away?” John asked with a laugh. Sherlock rolled his eyes and pulled him the rest of the way to the car.
“You’re always starving,” Sherlock said with a small laugh. He grabbed his bag and put his things away. “School’s almost over you know. I don’t know what you’re going to do when you can’t spend all this time with me.”
John grinned. “I’m honored then,” he hummed. The smile fell from his face when his house came into view. “Well this is it I guess. Dinner was great, I had fun.”
Sherlock smiled. “Actually, I got roped into helping with the school play for the end of the year and I need someone to help me paint the sets and put everything together.”
It was the night before John was supposed to leave. He had twenty hours left with Sherlock. Twenty hours left and he wasn’t ready.
John shook his head. “Never picked up,” he mumbled. “The nurse said I could rest here for the rest of the day though.”
Sherlock opened his arms when the other seemed to be heading for him and soon he was smothered with John. He pressed his face into his hair as John pressed his face into his shoulder.
Sherlock shook his head, slowly sliding his hand over top of John’s unable to stop himself. He was enjoying the night so much, he didn’t want it to stop. “Thanks for letting me give you such a great night,” he smiled.
He quickly moved from his seat and ran down the stands. He hit the fence, growling as he couldn’t get closer to John. The match was stopped and the EMTs hurried to get John on a stretched and took him off the field.
“I do too,” John laughed, rubbing his stomach. “I could have ate another serving of those noodles. She’s really good at selling them.”
Sherlock watched John run out before chasing after him. He found him in the middle of the hall, hyperventilating.  The teacher quickly went to his side and grabbed his shoulders. “Breath John,” he told him. “Deep breaths. Calm down.”
John grinned even more as they sat down at a table. “Well you’re my favorite teacher, Mr. Holmes,” he said.
John shook his head. “I forgot to tell my dad that I wasn’t staying late and now he’s angry,” he said. “I got a lot to do tonight. I’ll see you tomorrow.”
John chuckled softly, shrugging his shoulder. "That's alright," he said softly, pulling him into a quick kiss. "This is perfect." He pulled back before sitting down. He pulled out the snacks he picked out, motioning for Sherlock to sit as well. "I chose this just for you." He held out some chocolate for him. "I saw it and thought you needed a bit of sweetening up.
Sherlock smirked and ducked under the water, swimming closer to John before lifting him out of the water and throwing him back.
The bell rang and Sherlock smirked as he stood up. “Welcome back, I hope you guys are ready for the fun today,” he hummed. “We will be having a test on what we have learned throughout the year. Well, you will be taking this test, I’ll be watching you squirm in your seats. Most of you at least.” He sent a smile towards John. “Here’s the best part though. Whoever gets the highest grade will get whatever they want.”
He looked around, trying to find a sign of someone living there but there was none. The place was abandoned it looked like.
John pulled away after a few moments, smiling up at him. “Do you think I can stay over?” he asked quietly. He didn’t want to go home after tonight.
“What are you doing tonight?” Sherlock asked before he could get out of the car. “Are you going to hang out with those friends of yours?”
John glanced at the clock and raised an eyebrow. It was nearly nine. Sherlock was usually an early riser. “How long have you been up?”
John licked his lips a bit. “Mr. Holmes, I have a question to ask you,” he said. He was given a small nod. John started pulling at his fingers a bit and looked around. “I was wondering if I could skip detention today. You see I have a date and well…”
“You’re right, but it got you moving,” Sherlock hummed as he led him to his car. He opened the door and waited for him to climb in and get settled before moving to his own seat. “You seem to be much better than earlier. Sore?”
The bell rang and everyone quieted down. Sherlock was still sitting there, not talking or anything. After ten minutes the students started talking.
“I don’t think I’ll ever be settled there,” John murmured as he looked up at him. He squeezed his hand tightly before leaning up to give him a kiss.
Later that day at lunch Sherlock found John sitting with his friend Mike at a table, the teen didn’t look too happy. Sherlock quickly went to where he was and leaned against the table. “Mr. Watson, I got some great news,” he said.
John looked up at him. “Thank you,” he whispered back. He nodded again and reached for his hand. He squeezed it gently and shut his eyes.
John nodded; he was in no shape to argue. Last time he was able to sleep some in the alley but he was in too much pain now.
John laughed and tackled him into the water. He started to swim under water to get away from him. He felt Sherlock next to him and he was pushed to the side.
John wasn’t sure how he had gotten back to the flat, but he found himself standing just inside. He felt numb to it all. It was as if he expected it.
He was so happy to have a date. The last day he had he was eleven and his mother was alive to help him with the tie. He also really liked Sarah. Had for weeks and almost everyone known it.
Mr. Jamison shook his head and got up to pick his pens. “You don’t need to throw a fit,” he yelled after Sherlock.
Sherlock laughed as he started the car. “Of course,” he said. “I do hope you do that. You would smell worse.”
Sure enough at five thirty John showed up, a large smile on his face as he approached Sherlock. “I saw you watching,” he told him. “Do you like rugby?”
Sherlock tightened his arms around him, peppering light kisses where he could reach. “I know you don’t but…you’ll be back before you know it and I’ll write you every day. I’ll write you twice a day if you need it. When you graduate, I’ll be there standing proudly with everyone else. When you’re released into the free world again, I will shag you senseless and then we’ll spend whatever time we have left in bed or doing whatever you want before you’re sent off to school. Even then I will be able to see you more.”
He squeezed his hand to get his attention. “What’s wrong?” he asked when he looked up. It had to be more than just the jitters about going. There was something that Sherlock couldn’t quite pinpoint about the emotions going over John’s face.
John sat up, shaking his head. "I took a shower and didn't want to get fully dressed," he told him with a laugh. He pushed himself off the couch and moved over to him. "And I want to go out and eat with you." He leaned down and kissed his neck. "Please."
John pulled out his wallet to pay for the food he grabbed and looked back at her. "Yeah, I'm excited. I'll get to spend some time with friends and family before I have to leave."
John smiled a bit, climbing down from the bed and hurrying after the older man. “You wouldn’t do that,” he muttered, grinning at his side.
John nodded as he slipped outside. “I see you didn’t get the paint out of your hair yet,” he said. He reached up and plucked a rather large piece out. “You got a bit of red in there now.”
“I was worried about you,” Sherlock said. “When I left I saw it raining and knew you would be out and about in it.”
John grabbed his sweater and started using that to clean himself. “I have to do laundry anyway,” he said. “I really don’t want to get in anymore trouble as it is.”
Or he thought he could handle it. It was so hard seeing John. His friends able to relax around him, girls flirting with him. He wanted it to stop. What could he do though? He was just the teacher. He couldn’t tell them all that John was his and no one else could have him.
John didn’t know what to do. Every corner he turned he was expecting to see his father but every time he was disappointed.
After a while John knew it was time to leave. He couldn’t stay a moment longer. He slowly walked to the front door, his chest tight with worry and the uneasy feeling of knowing exactly what was wrong.
Sherlock opened his mouth to start telling John’s story but Banks beat him to it. “We were walking around yesterday and then this bloke here,” he pointed to John, “pulls my buddy into the alleyway and starts beating him up.”
John was tapping his fingers lightly on his knee as he watched the town passed by the window. “Are you okay now Mr. Holmes?” he asked after a while, looking over at him.
John could tell that Sherlock didn't want to talk. He just looked down into his lap, playing with his fingers. Today was supposed to be nice. He had to ruin it.
John let out a small chuckle, heart thumping in his chest. When he saw Sherlock’s eyes dart down he couldn’t stop himself. He leaned forward and kissed him, keeping it simple and chaste. He squeezed his hand, his eyes closing.
John passed in the test first. The teen was rather confident that he got a great grade. He had listened to the teacher and studied everything that he was supposed to. Why wouldn’t he get a good grade?
Oh those words sent a hit to Sherlock's gut. He should just leave, wait for John at the checkouts. It's not like he could walk up to him and tell the other that he was his. But what if John said yes?
John reached over, taking his hand and started to play with his fingers. "But I don't want to leave you," he said quietly. "I will finish my training and if you still want me I will come back to you. We can live together. Be a proper couple."
Sherlock nodded and grabbed his jacket. He paused for a moment and looked around. “We should probably wipe ourselves off first.”
When the teen turned though, Sherlock had to bite the inside of his lip as he saw the beaten look on John’s face. Blood seemed to cover the front of his shirt along with his sleeves where it seemed John was trying to stop the bleeding. “Mr. Watson, to the nurses now,” he said. “Class, turn to page 345 and read chapter eleven.”
Sherlock raised an eyebrow and shook his head. “No, no, I’ll take you out for your birthday,” he said. “I’ll make sure you have a great time too. Your friends will wish they came with us.”
Sherlock nodded, smiling a bit. "We are," he said softly. "But we still have a lot to talk about. This is your life but I want to try to be apart of it."
He knew the other was speaking. He could feel the rumble against his head. But all he wanted to focus on was his heart. The steady thrum of life coursing through him.
John squeezed his eyes shut and wound his arms around Sherlock. “I’m okay,” he murmured against his chest. “I promise. I’m okay.”
Sherlock nodded. “You have the last three games to play,” he said. “You just have to serve detention with me and that shouldn’t be that hard.”
“I was going to do it but I had practice then I had to make dinner and clean up around the house and by the time I was done I was so tired I passed out right when I got to my room and…I’m sorry sir,” John said quickly.
John laughed dryly and shook his head. “I don’t care if he did,” he muttered, looking out the window.
He wasn't surprised when he heard the groan from John, he only sat up a bit, looking over his shoulder. "Do you need something, Mr. Watson," he asked with a smile.
John was walking on cloud nine as he walked into Mr. Holmes class the next morning. The week had been looking up for him. It was nearly the weekend and he had a date later that night. He couldn’t ask for anything better.
Though after class on one Thursday John came up to him, smiling over at him. Sherlock glanced up at him, raising an eyebrow. “Yes, Mr. Watson?” he asked, sitting back and crossing his arms.
Sherlock smiled softly, his arms sliding around his waist once again, and tugged him a little closer. “Anything for you.”
Once everyone had the test he went to his desk, slowly sitting down. “Begin,” he said in a low voice, grinning at the students.
Sherlock smirked and sat down next to him. “I have at least one thing in mind,” he said, wrapping his arm around his shoulders and kissed him again.
Sherlock noticed John laughing whenever he looked up at him. He couldn’t keep the smile from his face, probably confusing the other students. After a while Sherlock had enough of John’s chuckling and put the students on quiet study.
Sherlock’s heart sunk a bit. John was going to say yes. He was going to tell him their plans were cancelled. John shook his head though. “I got plans already,” he told him. “An old friend is taking me out to dinner. Maybe after the match tomorrow.”
Neither spoke until they were back at the flat. It wasn’t an awkward silence, but it was tense. Sherlock watched as John walked in and went straight for the bathroom. He sighed, shaking his head before heading to the door as it shut.
Half of the job was done. It might not take them the rest of the two days to finish all the work. John looked at the time. “Alright Mr. Holmes, it’s time for me to head to practice,” he told him. He cleaned off his brush and set it aside. “Are you sure you’ll be alright by yourself?”
Sherlock laughed and nodded. “Yeah, I don’t think people would like if a teacher was hanging around with their students.”
He packed everything back up and checked his phone to make sure no one texted him while he was at work. It was odd, no one ever texted him but he still checked.
“Okay, I’ll drive you home,” Sherlock said as quietly as John did. He backed away from the teen when the nurse came back into the room. “I should be getting back to my classes now. I’ll check on you in a bit. Can’t have my best student getting worse while I’m away.” He gave a nod to the two before leaving.
When he was half way to John’s house he spotted the blond sitting on a bench, looking defeated. Sherlock pulled up and despite better judgment he climbed out of the car and walked over to him.
Sherlock nodded and picked up his jacket. “If you hurry you won’t have to run after my car,” he said, handing it to the teen before going to the door.
Sherlock nodded and gave his shoulder a small squeeze. “Come on, let’s go,” he said pulling back from the lake.
He would even be able to get home in time to finish all his chores and have dinner ready for his dad by five. He could pick Sarah up and take her to the diner. He would be back in time to finish his homework by ten and be in bed by eleven. A perfect plan.
John was graduating. He never thought the day would come where he could finally move out and start his life new. But it was coming, the next day he would walk with his classmates, his friends, and then he would be set free to live as he pleased.
"I didn't tell you because honestly I forgot about it and for the longest time I didn't think anything like this would happen," John told him before he could go further. He turned so he could face him. "When I signed up it was so I could get out of my father's house. I didn't want to stay in this horrible town anymore. This was all before...."
John nodded and took them to the bathroom, changing into the bottoms and taking off his shirt. He folded his clothes and put them under his arm. He left the bathroom and smiled at Sherlock who was one the couch. He set his clothes by the door and went to join him, laying with his back against his chest.
Turning it over in his mind Sherlock shrugged again. “Maybe I’ll make it,” he said. “I don’t know though. I have a full Saturday.” He saw John’s face fall a bit. “I was joking Mr. Watson.”
Odd, he thought, that was the teen that beat John up. He shook his head and started walking again to his room. It wasn’t long after when he saw John limping down the hall looking worse than that one morning.
John nodded. “I’m sure they went to this school though,” he told him. He paused and stopped walking. He looked down the hall at another teen. “Wow,” he mumbled. “That’s him Mr. Holmes.”
Once he got up to the teachers room he opened the door but noticed the man wasn’t there He groaned and jogged down to the auditorium, the man wasn’t there either. John bit his lip and noticed that the back door was propped open. He moved over to it and peeked outside. “Mr. Holmes,” he said, “I’ve been looking all over the place for you.”
Sherlock waved his hand. “Just things that are supposed to be fun,” he shrugged. “Nothing important. Sadly it will be the only thing you guys remember in ten years.”
John nodded and grabbed his bag. “See you tomorrow at the same time Mr. Holmes,” he said as he climbed out.
“You look tired,” Sherlock smirked as he took off his glasses. John opened his mouth and quickly shut it as Sherlock raised a finger. “You look tired but you’re early so you didn’t stay up late last night to finish them, you woke up early.”
After a few hours of sitting around the restaurant and eating a few things here and there John decided it was time for a change of venue. He left the place with Sherlock by his side. He slipped into his seat and waited for Sherlock to get it. “Where are we going then, Mr. Watson?” he asked.
John bit his lip, letting out a small laugh. “You’ve got a bit of blue stuff in your hair sir,” he told him. “From yesterday.”
The slightly muddled look on John’s face made him chuckle slightly. ”You said yesterday that you had dishes to do, I remember because you complained about them most of the way home. You also mentioned that’s why you leave them for last.”
With a deep breath he left his room before heading to the nurse’s office. He knocked on the door and nodded to the nurse, smiling a bit when he saw that John was asleep.
The teen nodded and shifted his bag on his shoulder. “Thank you, Mr. Holmes,” he said softly. “I’ll um….see you later.” He felt giddy and he wasn’t sure if he should be or not. It was just like any other time they went out. Nothing new. He gave a small wave to Sherlock before hurrying out of the room.
Sherlock was already out and walking towards the car. He shot a glance over his shoulder before climbing in. Without a word he started the car and started to drive. He was still in a bit of shock. How could he be such an idiot.
Sherlock licked his lips, swallowing a small lump in his throat. “Yes, I figured he couldn’t get home on his own and his father couldn’t make it, I might as well help out the best I can.”
Panic started to set in. Where was his dad? He started to run now, looking in every room of the house but it was all the same. Untouched. Unlived in for what seemed like months.
In class John paid more attention to the lecture. He wanted the best scores out of the class and it shouldn’t be that hard. He kept catching Sherlock’s eye and laughed a few times as he noticed blue flakes still in the man’s hair.
John shut the door and slowly went to the house. He watched his teacher drive off with a smile before going inside.
When the bell rang John stood up and was heading for the door when Sherlock stopped him again. “Mr. Watson, you did well on
Sherlock nodded and stood up. “Come on then,” he said. He grabbed his arm and helped him up. “Thank you for letting me do this.”
John looked up, giving him a hard look that said he didn’t want to talk about it. Sherlock knew he was going to have to pry and potentially ruin the night or fix him, or he could just leave it and let John roam alone in his mind.
They were quiet while they finished their ice cream. Sherlock glancing over at John quietly as he ate his ice cream, smiling a bit. The older man finished before his student, it was only a given. John’s was much larger than his. He had time to look him over, enjoying the way he looked in the nights of the lights. He was so handsome. Sherlock knew he should stop the thoughts but he couldn’t. He wanted to reach out and kiss him.
Sherlock leaned against his desk and shrugged his shoulders. “It’s fine; you’re a teenager who has loads of hormones in their bodies. A pretty girl asked you out and you said yes, nothing else mattered.”
Sherlock was pulled from his thoughts when John began to stir. He smiled and pressed a kiss to his broad shoulders. “You up?” he asked, his voice low and rough.
John' shrugged his shoulder, looking down at his feet. "I've been busy," he muttered before he looked up at him. "I'm surprised that you show up at all."
“It does to,” John laughed softly. He grabbed his hand and gave it a small kiss. “I’ll still be leaving on Friday whether we stay in bed or not.”
John ducked his head down into his book, his eyes going over the pages quickly as he tried to take in the information before he saw Sherlock’s shiny shoes in front of him. He glanced up, trying to stop himself from laughing more.
Sherlock nodded. "Yes I am," he grinned. He looked at John with a smirk before looking back to her. "I get to relax and spend time with my loved ones."
“I tried, that all went down the drain years ago though,” Sherlock smirked. “You’re the first student I had faith since I’ve started.”
John’s stomach dropped. He stared at the man with wide eyes. He couldn’t believe what he just said. He stood up and ran from the office.
Mike turned back to John. “So, I’m going to take her to that diner down the street from here,” John told him. “I heard she really likes it.”
“I don’t forget things easily Mr. Watson,” Sherlock said with a sidelong smile. He grabbed the paint cans and brushes before he went over to a house they were supposed to be painting. “Let’s get to work.”
"Well, I was thinking that its such a nice day that we can go out and have ourselves a picnic," Sherlock said with a smile. "Pick up a few things from the shop and go to the park:"
John sat down on the sofa and stretched his legs out. “So, what do you want to do now?” he asked, looking over at Sherlock.
John was easy to read most of the time. His emotions played across his face like a movie screen playing a movie. Though, there were times he was harder to read than his older brother.
When they both were done they made their way to the car and sat inside it for a moment before Sherlock turned on the car. “I really like that restaurant,” Sherlock smiled, turning the key.
The match was almost over, just a few minutes left and the opposite team was up by one point. Sherlock was really getting into it now. When John intercepted the ball from the other team he jumped up and cheered.
Sherlock drove to the school on a Saturday. A day he wasn’t even supposed to go near the school. All for a student that’s wormed his way under Sherlock’s skin, all in a good way though. He found a spot far away from the field, not wanting it to get destroyed by crowds that may or may not show up after the match.
Sherlock wrapped his arm around his waist and started to flip through the channels looking for a movie. When he found one he tossed the remote off to the side and rested his head against the arm of the sofa. “Happy birthday,” he whispered, pressing a kiss to John’s cheek.
John smiled, happy that he understood that’s what he wanted. “I’ll see you later,” he said. He hesitated, watching Sherlock for a second longer before leaving.
Sherlock unrolled the window. “Get some rest and warm up,” he called after him. “Goodnight Mr. Watson.”
John let out a small groan and his eyes opened slowly. “Oh god,” he mumbled, rubbing his head. “I don’t want to feel that again.”
The older man kissed him deeply, sliding his hand under his shirt, feeling the muscles working underneath his hand as John moved with his touch. He wanted to never stop touching the man’s body.
Sherlock winced when he saw John get tackled. He watched the teen, waiting for him to get up but he didn’t move. His mouth went dry. John wasn’t moving.
John opened his quickly before everything came into focus and he glared at his teacher. “You’re an evil man,” he said as he slowly sat up. “Are we leaving?”
“Mr. Holmes,” John laughed, giving his teacher a look. “God, you’re horrible. First you spend too much time with your favorite student, now you’re insulting the others. You’re not the type of teacher to follow the rules are you?”
