It was veering towards the later hours of trick-or-treat time, and now that the streams of children had thinned, Castiel had an opportunity to take a good look at his competition.
“No, you’re not,” Castiel replied, if grudgingly. “You’re just doing your job.”
“Okay.” Castiel half-smiled. “I guess I’ll just, um…” He turned to leave, mentally screaming at himself for behaving like such an idiot, before he remembered: “Wait!” He turned back to Dean, pulling out the book he’d stuck in the massive inner pocket of his jacket. “I forgot to give you this.”
“A combination of verbal and physical,” he replied, desperately wishing that he could mute the heart monitor. “But those two years were a concentration of his efforts.”
Dean sent him a hesitant smile before clapping his hands together. “Now. When’re you gonna let me take a Sharpie to that thing?”
Castiel: … god help me.
“Fine,” Castiel grated out, his throat thick from telling that lie far too many times. He heard Michael’s jeering laugh ring in his ears, and he winced as he slowly sat up, reaching for his briefcase.
“No.” Castiel wiped his eyes as Wile E. Coyote smashed into a cliff face. “What gave you that idea?”
“Really? Shit. Are you okay now?” Gabe asked Castiel. “Do you need anything? Water? Food? A nap?”
Dean nodded, reaching forward with the Neosporin-ed swab and slowly dabbing at what Castiel guessed was his wound. “You hit the concrete pretty hard, so you’ve got a bit of a scrape.” He put down the swab and reached for a clean square of gauze.
Wary, Gabe took the papers from Michael and scanned them with a focused eye.
Castiel sighed a long-enduring sigh. “C’mon. Let’s get to the arrival lounge.”
Castiel clapped him on the shoulder and led him out of the Administrative Center. “Ten bucks it is. I’m just glad you didn’t get syrup on your tie.” Dean snorted but didn’t deny it. “So.” Castiel stopped on the edge of the quad, which was shining benignly in the weak sunshine. “What do you think?”
> Dean: ???????????
Dean was quiet for a moment before he said: “All right. You. Me. Next snowfall. We’re havin’ a snowball fight.”
“What about the others? They probably have their— Oh.” Castiel shut up when Dean stuck his hands into the pockets of Garth’s coat and pulled out two familiar cell phones.
“No kiddin’.” Dean looked somewhat impressed, and Castiel awarded himself a point in the category of (hopefully) getting Dean to be friends with Hael.
Castiel tried to swallow, unsure if he would be able to talk very coherently. “Thirssy.”
Castiel groaned and massaged his temples, his elbows propped up on his various notebooks and Bibles. “I’m so sick of Jesus.”
Castiel suddenly became aware of how close Dean’s face was to his, his green eyes shining in the residual light of the TV. He also realized that his head was resting on something very warm and very shelf-like — he’d fallen asleep with his head on Dean’s shoulder.
“Lies,” Dean hissed, before he was interrupted by a slim, cool voice:
“No parents?” Dean asked, his voice soft.
He tried burying himself in his work, finishing all of his grading in one day and reading an entire book through the night, though he had no way of telling whether or not his notes and comments made coherent sense. At least he managed to get Bastet to the vet on Saturday to get her cast sawn off, after which she looked rather pleased with herself. On Sunday morning, he slept undisturbed for three hours and felt a little bit better afterwards, especially after he’d chugged his second coffee of the day.
Castiel’s eyebrows shot up. “Really?”
was getting a little lonely without you.” He reached over and unzipped the top of the bag, which Castiel suddenly realized was actually Bastet’s carrier, and a moment later, Bastet’s head popped out of the bag as she gave a loud meow.
Dean shook his head and rolled his eyes. “You’re gonna have to start owin’ me a dollar every time you apologize for no reason.” He put both cups back on Castiel’s tray and leaned on the bed rail, his arms crossed against his chest. “D’you remember what happened?”
Castiel tried to lift his arm to grab the cup, frowning when his hand only twitched. Out of the corner of his eye, he caught the way Dean’s mouth quirked up before Dean said, “Here. I’ll get you a straw.” He pulled open one of the drawers in Castiel’s bedside table and pulled out a paper-wrapped straw, quickly unwrapping it and dunking it into one of the cups. As he lifted the cup towards Castiel, he looked into Castiel’s face, and only then did Castiel see that Dean’s eyes were tight with worry and ringed with exhaustion.
p.s. al's drive-in isn't actually a thing in cleveland (sadly) and nor is there a garage next to 2154 fulton road.
“I know. I used to make ‘em for Sammy.” Dean’s gaze lingered on Castiel before he returned his attention to the pan. “But I don’t think he ever had quite the same reaction.”
Dean stiffened. “Don’t you dare say that to me. Do not
“Only three percent. For each of you.” The corner of Michael’s mouth twisted in some sick satisfaction. “Meaning you’ll have seven percent of the stock instead of ten.”
“I second that.” Anna was already halfway through her slice and still going strong. “This is gonna be the death of me, I swear.”
Castiel could hear Bobby and Sam talking in the living room, and he caught a glimpse of their well-lit Christmas tree before he and Dean were stepping into the doorway and Sam and Bobby went quiet, staring at Castiel and Dean with undeniably smug expressions.
“I can take care of myself,” Castiel assured her.
“We’ve been friends for what, four months now?”
By the time the game started, Gabe and Dean were stupidly excited, even though they were technically rivals (Gabe supported the Patriots, Dean the Cowboys). When the Patriots got the first down, Gabe was whooping and Dean was half-heartedly trash-talking him and the team, both of them grinning like idiots. Castiel smiled at them from where he sat in the armchair, reading a new book that had to do with a section of his current paper and feeling like a proud parent.
“No.” Castiel stood up, putting down his book and going over to the front door. Somewhat perplexed, he unlocked the door and pulled it open. When he saw who was standing on his porch, his stomach turned to ice and dropped to his ankles, his grip on the door’s handle starting to tremble.
Castiel flinched minutely at being addressed and shook his head. “
Dean gaped at Castiel for several moments before turning to his book. "
“She?” Castiel found himself asking, one hand resting on the Rambler’s shiny white hood.
Hael was already pushing them into his hand. “Thirty-two copies, just like you asked.”
as always, thank you for reading and feedback is loved and appreciated!
“For disturbing you.”
with a guy in a semi-public place, even if I wanted to.”
Castiel forced himself to take a breath. “Yes.” He stepped back, holding the door open. “Please… come in.”
“I dunno. Just, y’know.” Dean waved his hand vaguely. “Whatever you think I would like.”
“You’ll like it. I promise.” Castiel wiggled the book in mid-air. “You know you want it.”
Gabe grabbed Castiel’s face and planted a huge kiss on his mouth with a loud
Sam laughed as they shook hands; Castiel felt Sam’s hand swallowing his. “Not as much as I’ve heard about you. You’re all Dean talks about these days.” He gave Dean a look Castiel couldn’t decipher, and Castiel felt a blush rise on his cheeks.
< Dean: Well Gabe is
Bobby blinked in surprise. “There’re three presents,” he said after a moment.
If the fracture is not out of place or is a very low fracture with very small pieces, it can be treated without surgery.
note: the park near cas' house actually does exist (and there is a swimming pool, oddly enough), but as far as i could tell from google maps, there isn't actually a duck pond :( regardless, i hope i didn't offend any cleveland natives who really like greenwood park...
Dean peered down at the Visitor name tag on his shirt, picking at one of the corners. “Ten bucks says I’ll forget this is on my shirt and throw it in the washer just the same.”
A quiet chuckle. “Shoulda known you’d fall asleep.”
“Well, the problem with Cas is that his coping mechanism is to internalize everything, to compress it and stuff it all in so he won’t risk hurting other people or, Heaven forbid, getting them upset.” Gabe rolled his eyes. “It’s incredibly frustrating, especially considering the crap he’s been through. He
He never ended up replying to the text from Dean, and he hadn’t heard from Dean since. Castiel wasn’t really expecting to. Everything between them was so… jagged. He didn’t know what to do or say given their last flimsy interaction, and was alarmingly grateful for the amount of work he had to do. And for their opposite schedules. Back when they were still around each other, Dean had mentioned picking up more night shifts now that Sam’s school year was starting, and Castiel had teased him about being in it just for the pudding the hospital served at dinner.
He could hear Dean’s smile in his voice: “Well, how’d you like to come to Bobby’s with me for Christmas? Just so you’re not alone. Sam’ll be there.”
Castiel swallowed and tried to find another thing to look at. Dean the Mechanic was, somehow, even hotter than Dean the Nurse.
Dean groaned, pushing a hand through his already-disheveled hair. “You’re not helpin’ here.”
“I wouldn’t dream of it.”
His heart thumping, Castiel quickly typed out some replies:
Then Dean started drilling Jodie for the facts, and they spent the next awfully-long-amount-of-time verbally picking the Rambler apart. Castiel stayed on the sidelines and tried to follow what they were saying but when the word “carburetor” surfaced he called it quits and zoned out completely.
Dean let out a small chuckle, his gaze falling to Castiel’s mouth. Dean inhaled quickly, his grin disappearing, and suddenly Castiel was aware of their proximity. His face flooded with warmth, his stomach erupted into butterflies, and he couldn’t stop looking at Dean’s bottom lip, even though he knew it was wrong, it was very very wrong of him to be indulging like this. But when he looked up, he found Dean staring at him, closer than he was before, his eyes so green and wide and his tongue darting out to moisten the edge of his lip, and before Castiel knew it, Dean was leaning forward, his mouth open and exhaling warmth and Castiel barely had a moment to react before —
“All right,” Castiel whispered back. “I’ll stay.” Gritting his teeth, he slid onto the bed, gently lifting the duvet and settling himself what he thought to be a reasonable distance from Dean. But a split second later, Dean the Octopus was wrapping himself around Castiel, tugging him around so that they were facing each other and burying his face in Castiel’s shoulder, Bastet curled in between them.
, he realized glumly. He’d made the ER before he’d made any friends, now that he was thinking of it.
The remaining weeks of the school term flew by, punctuated by Castiel’s victory in convincing Dean to fly to South Dakota and his therapy sessions with Dr. Shurley, née Chuck, which were going very well. When the nightmare finally did return, it was Castiel’s old one, the dream of being left alone in the forest, unable to find his way out, and Castiel awoke from it with a kind of relief, because it was much less traumatic than his dreams with Michael in them. Then, as he lay in bed, one hand on Bastet’s back, he’d begun to implement the breathing techniques Chuck had taught him, along with a certain kind of mental exercise that Chuck had classified as being half-meditation, half-distraction, and ten minutes later, he was fast asleep again, and didn’t dream at all.
Dean rubbed the back of his neck before sidestepping, reaching for the DVDs scattered across the coffee table among the ruins of a movie-watching feast. He cleared his throat, not looking at Castiel, and turned off the TV as he stuffed the DVDs into his bag.
“I didn’t lie, but she, um… committed suicide.”
Bastet started purring again, and Castiel swore she smirked.
They got the all-clear over the radio around lunchtime. It hadn’t snowed since the night before, and now people were starting to shovel their driveways and wait for the city’s snow plows to clear the roads. The autumn weather was back in full force, so the snow was starting to melt, meaning that any evidence of the snowstorm would soon be gone. Not long after they heard the announcement, Dean’s expression changed into something unreadable, and he stood up, saying that he should really head home.
Hael cleared her throat in one quick, delicate cough and stood up. “Well, actually, it’s up to thirty now.”
“Good,” Castiel mumbled to himself before turning to his chest of drawers and pulling out a shirt and a pair of pajama pants. He went back out into the hallway and quickly stripped out of his Batman costume, reaching around the doorway of the bathroom to throw it into the hamper, before he changed into his other clothes. He made sure to grab an extra pillow and duvet from his linens cupboard, and when he went back downstairs, he gently tossed them onto one end of the couch. Then, he performed his usual closing-up routine, wiping down the kitchen and making sure all the doors and windows were locked. He turned out all of the lights except for the one next to the couch and tucked Bastet into his arms, gently carrying her upstairs with him. Now that her stitches were out and her cone was off, she was more of her old self, but he was still wary of letting her walk around on her own with the cast on. He turned out his hall light before quietly going into his bedroom, where Dean was still a thickly-breathing lump under his duvet.
Castiel nodded and tried to say, “Of course,” but it came out more like, “Nnnghnmmmjrbl.”
They were at the drive-in in Castiel’s car (Gabe had been gleeful at the opportunity to drive it), watching
like Castiel, whether or not he wanted to be with Castiel in a serious way.
“Yeah, yeah, you’re hilarious.” Dean stepped away, waving Castiel forward. “C’mon, Prof. We gotta get goin’ if we want to eat before we leave.”
lap?” Kevin wanted to know as he gathered up the pile of used cards. “I’m the one doing all the work. I deserve kitty cuddles.”
“You’re not big on pain meds so I gotta make sure you take ‘em.” Dean shrugged. “I’m annoyin’ that way.”
Castiel turned around, looking between them. “Thank you both for all your help today. It was… exceptionally nice of you.” He offered them a soft smile before heading up the stairs, calling out, “Goodnight!”
“Yeah, but I saw you thinkin’ it.” Dean waved his spoon around in the air to demonstrate said thinking.
here?!”
Gabe finally released him and stood grinning at Castiel, his face red with exertion and his floppy brown hair tucked into an absurd fur-lined aviator hat, the snow swirling in through the open door behind him. “Surprise!”
The vet smiled at them both. “Luckily, she didn’t have any internal injuries. It seems that she tried to duck under the car and just got clipped by the bumper, which means there was less of an impact. We easily stitched up the cut on her side, but she does have a broken leg. We’ll cast her up before we put her down for the night. She’s going to be in the cast for at least four weeks.”
“I’m…” Castiel gestured sleepily over his shoulder. “I’m going over there.” He followed Dean, plopping down on the couch next to him.
Dr. Bradbury raised an eyebrow.
Michael smiled thinly and stepped past Gabriel. “Thank you, Castiel.” He brushed some invisible dust off his sleeve and went into the living room, taking in his surroundings. “Interesting décor. It’s so… homey.” His gaze landed on the couch area, and Dean hastily stood up, muting the TV. “I see I interrupted quite the party.” Michael looked incredibly pleased with himself. “Who’s this?”
Castiel stared at him, surprised and slightly disbelieving. “I… yeah. Do you want to come in with me or get there on your own?”
“Got any twos?”
“Sorry,” Gabe mumbled before he looked at his brother. “Are you sure—?”
Castiel coughed, the tension slowly leaking out of his body. His room was still dark, save for the glow from his heart monitor and the fluorescent light pooling in from the hallway; the door to his room was open. “I wasn’t screaming, was I?”
, were all the sensations he was aware of before it hit him that Dean wasn’t kissing him back, was standing there frozen with shock, and Castiel instantly pulled away, warmth flooding his face.
“So,” Castiel said, making his own plate of bacon and eggs. “How’re you feeling?”
They stayed there for a moment in the dim light, keeping eye contact but not saying anything. Castiel once again became painfully aware of their proximity and glanced down at Dean’s mouth, not noticing Dean doing the same to him, before turning to reach for his crutches. He gave Dean half a smile. “Any chance I could have some help?”
Meg and Kevin slurred something in response. Garth grinned bashfully and reached for Castiel’s coat stand. “Almost forgot my jacket.” He slung his sheepskin coat over his arm and smiled at Castiel. “Thanks for tonight. It really was nice to meet you.” And suddenly he had Castiel in a bear grip, hugging him for all his worth. A terrifying moment later (Castiel was just grateful they’d all put on their clothes again), Garth pulled away and patted Castiel on the shoulder. “We should do this again sometime.”
“You’ve had nothing but coffee since eight o’clock this morning,” she cut in. “Unless you plan on becoming an ulcer connoisseur, you need to eat something.”
“S’what I’m good at,” Dean mumbled, followed by a long period of silence. Castiel guessed that Dean had fallen asleep, and tried his best to return his attention to Buddhist symbolism and its appearances in Eastern media. He felt the words dragging at his eyelids, the margins blurring his gaze, but he pressed forward, knowing that he couldn’t let himself fall asleep.
straight, even though you’re not, are you?”
“Please?” Dean whispered, sounding so morose that Castiel couldn’t say no.
Castiel was silent for a long moment before he said, “Is he gone?”
“Got any threes?”
Dean went still, sobered. “Right,” he said with a nod, and for a minute or so, they both watched the movie in silence. Then he smirked and said, “I still can’t believe you let me eat in your brand-new car.”
“I’m not bein’ ridiculous.” Dean pulled his feet closer to himself. “Now get on the damn couch.”
Castiel snorted. “Like I’m going to make you stay in a motel for one night. No. You’ll stay here. And I have it on good authority that this couch is very comfortable.”
“Wait!” Dean quickly stood up, his grin shining in the candlelight. “I’ve got somethin’ to say.” He cleared his throat quickly and they all raised their glasses accordingly, Castiel wondering what on earth Dean was going to say. Almost as if Dean had heard his thoughts, Dean’s gaze flickered to Castiel’s before he began to speak: “This year, I had the pleasure of bein’ Dr. Castiel Novak’s nurse on the night he got himself into a car accident. And then I had the pleasure of meetin’ my new neighbor, Dr. Castiel Novak.” Gabe and Anna tittered at this; Castiel’s heart thumped unhelpfully. Dean looked at him again, his eyes bright and sincere. “And he has been the best friend I’ve ever had. And I mean that truthfully,” he added when Castiel started to roll his eyes. “You and Gabe and Anna have welcomed me and included me in your family in a way that’s never happened to me before. You have made me happier than I have been in months, and you’ve made me want to actually read the Bible, which is sayin’ somethin’.” Gabe and Anna chuckled again, but Castiel could only keep eye contact with Dean, his mouth dry. Dean smiled at him before saying, “So thank you. I’m honored to have been included the way I have, and I am pretty damn happy that I’m now friends with a chef, because this is the most beautiful Thanksgiving meal I’ve ever seen!” Dean broke eye contact with Castiel to cheer with the others, quickly swallowing a gulp of apple cider before sitting back down. Castiel belatedly remembered to do the same, feeling the bubbles all the way in his nose.
¯\_(ツ)_/¯
They carried the tree back to the house, where Bobby greeted them with another twitch of his beard, and stuffed the tree into the green base that was sitting ready for them on the porch. Then, they hauled the tree into the living room and scooted it back into the corner, where it squatted happily amongst the disorganized bookcases and age-old leather armchairs. Bobby rewarded them with a, “You done good, boys,” and a clap on the shoulder before he told Sam and Dean to get a move on dinner, which, apparently, wasn’t going to cook itself. Everyone vehemently protested Castiel’s offer to help, but he managed to convince them to let him sit at the kitchen table and peel carrots for the salad while Dean and Sam argued over the best way to cook a burger.
“My little brother. He’s busy gettin’ himself a law degree out at Stanford. He’s real smart. But don’t call him Sammy. Call him Sam, or he’ll make one hell of a bitchface.”
Castiel found himself smiling back. He liked Sally. It made him a little sad to think that her shift was over. He dimly wondered who his overnight RN would be.
“It’s stale. I can’t imagine what you find so ‘good’ about it.” Castiel tossed another couple of chunks to the ducks, who snapped up the bread the moment it hit the water.
“Ditto. Though you’re not so bad, yourself, despite the fact that you’ve misplaced your nametag.”
At first, Castiel was inclined to ignore the knock at his front door, but when whoever it was persisted for several minutes, he rolled his eyes and answered it, his mouth dropping open in surprise when he saw who it was.
?” Dean piped up, leaning in Castiel’s doorway. “Didn’t peg you for a Marvel kind of man.”
Castiel forced himself to take a breath, ignoring the way Dean was looking at him. “Fourteen was the age at which I came out to my mother and denounced our family’s belief system; our father had left us by then. Michael found out and… he didn’t handle it well.” He became aware of a frantic beeping and realized that the sound was his heart monitor; his heart was pounding unhelpfully. Everyone in the room seemed to notice the change, and Dr. Barnes’ gaze flickered to the monitor before refocusing on him.
Castiel pulled out into the street. “Makes cleanup easier.” He glanced at Dean. “Speaking of, you’re toweling off the second she’s out of your hands. We can’t have you getting pneumonia.”
< Dean: You’re on.
Castiel grinned and rubbed the two remaining cards in his hand together. “Which is why I never play you at poker.”
“Oh, yeah.” Dean sidestepped Bastet and smirked at Castiel. “So, are you lettin’ me in, or what?”
“Just wait ‘til you see Sammy. You’re gonna love him. He’s such a nerd. Always talkin’ about NPR and oil spills.” Dean rolled his eyes, but Castiel saw that he was proud. “I wonder what car Bobby gave him this time.”
“I—okay.” Castiel curled in on himself. “Okay.”
A series of words tripped over each other on the tip of Castiel’s tongue —
Castiel stared him dumbly. “What does that mean?”
“Just now.” Dean stared at him. “You didn’t hear anythin’?”
“UGH,” he said aloud, thumping his head against the cabinet again.
“Hey, hey, hey,” Dean snapped. “You stress out my patient, I stress out your newly-healed face, capisce?”
in a supposed celebration of Gabe’s last night in town (Dean silently sent a prayer of thanks to the drive-in’s manager for liking Gene Kelly); Gabe was thrilled that he and the title character shared a name. Castiel’s mood hadn’t changed; he’d been quiet for the entire afternoon and evening, replying to all of their questions in simple phrases and always seeming to have his mind somewhere else, even as he fed the ducks and worked his way through a vanilla malt. Dean and Gabe had hastily tried to make up for it, Dean asking as many questions as he could think of about pastry-making and restaurant-managing, Gabe doing the same for nursing and car-rebuilding. If Castiel noticed that anything was off or awkward, he gave no indication of it.
Castiel woke up on Tuesday feeling distinctly… off. Then, he sat up with a gasp, because once again, no dream. Not even a hint of it. He covered his mouth with his hand, belatedly realizing that he
Castiel raised an eyebrow. “Funny.
“Honestly, I never thought I’d see you wearing a tie.”
“So long as it isn’t snowing,” Castiel replied with a swift glance at the windows. “I’m not in the mood for snow.”
> Dean Winchester: shit. knew i shouldve called him. try and get him to smush apples
Everything was so perfect and he just had to—” Gabe knocked the spoon into the sink, where it rattled against the can. This time, Bastet jumped and stared at him before settling back into her meal.
was this man beautiful.
Agnes slid her backpack off her shoulder and nervously took a seat across from him. “I was reading your doctoral thesis over the summer—”
“Dean, what are you doing?!”
Dean’s smile twitched and grew into something genuine. “You do that. I’ll just…” He gestured to the hallway, his gaze lingering on Castiel, before he looked away and headed upstairs.
Castiel glared at the sky through squinted eyes. “Maybe.”
(See the end of the chapter for
Gabe sighed in a slightly endearing way. “It’s a six second video, Cas. You make ‘em and post ‘em so people can watch ‘em.”
“Five weeks to go and counting,” Castiel intoned, scrubbing his fingers through his hair (it really was getting to be a bit long). “And if I don’t plan this course, no one else will.”
Castiel huffed, reaching for the lube and pressing a quick kiss to Dean’s hip. He’d have time to explore properly later. “Smartass.” He gently lifted one of Dean’s legs, kissing the top of his foot as he moved Dean’s thighs apart, squeezing lube onto his fingers. Leaning forward, Castiel pressed his mouth to Dean’s as he pushed his first finger in. Dean squirmed, panting heavily into Castiel’s mouth: “Cas,” he groaned.
Dean squinted at him. “In some states, that would be considered a felony.”
. Instead, he let out a flat, strained moan that trailed off into a whimper as Dean’s tongue flicked at the head before pressing against the swollen vein on the underside. Shuddering, Castiel mustered what was left of his will and reached for the lube. “Up, please, Dean,” he gasped, and Dean complied, grinning as he pulled off with an obscene
Castiel chuckled. “Not particularly, when you’re in my field. Anyway, I got to college and I started taking courses on Religion and the History of Religion, and that was when it sort of hit me, when I realized that there was nothing I’d rather study. It was a big moment for me, to realize that the very thing I’d dedicated so many years to hating had become my passion. Anyway, I went through grad school, got my doctorate, taught out in Massachusetts for a while, and then Oberlin gave me a call.” He smiled. “I’ve only been in Cleveland for a few weeks now.”
Dean lifted one shoulder and rolled his hips; Castiel gasped as Dean’s hardened length grazed across his own through the thin layers of cotton. “Let’s just say that I keep the lube for when I’m alone.” Dean’s eyes were dark and glinting. “And the condom? A silver lining.”
Castiel snorted. “As if. Now go on.” He raised his eyebrows, and a moment later, Dean gave in, snuggling under Castiel’s thick duvet and pressing his head against a plush pile of pillows on the same side he had slept on almost two months ago (Castiel distinctly heard him mumble, “This is so weird — Batman tryin’ to tuck me in—”). Dean snuffled a little before closing his eyes, the duvet tucked right up under his chin.
Castiel raised an eyebrow at the condom. “Planning for something?”
“Ow!” Castiel reared back, rubbing the spot Dean had hit. “What was that for?!”
That seemed to grab Dean’s attention. “What?” he gaped. “But you just moved in!”
“It’s fine,” Castiel cut him off. “Really. I wasn’t even… I just…” He pushed his hair away from his face and propped his elbow on the couch cushions. “I think about her a lot, how I never really knew her that well, the way my dad treated her, the way Michael...” He sighed a little. “That’s probably why I, you know—”
They stayed like that for a while, kissing while Castiel gently rocked his finger in and out of Dean; as Castiel eased his second finger in, Dean let out a low hiss of approval. Castiel bit at the bolt of Dean’s jaw and sucked at the soft skin under Dean’s chin until Castiel pushed his third finger in and Dean moaned so loudly Castiel had to swallow the sound with his own mouth for fear of waking Sam and Bobby up.
Castiel nodded, starting to blush. “Gotcha.”
Castiel let out a surprised laugh, putting the glass down on the bedside table again. “That’s one way of putting it.”
“Dean called me the second you got to the hospital. Dude was almost crying.” Gabe noticed Castiel’s reaction and hastily added, “Shit. Shouldn’t have said that. Anyhow. I left the bakery with my manager and my food truck with my sous chef and came running.” He gave Castiel’s shoulder a squeeze. “You’ve been out for a while, buddy.”
“All right, all right,” Castiel chided them, scooping the second slice onto its waiting plate. Anna handed him the next empty one, practically jabbing the plate into his arm in her eagerness. “It seems that you all really want my pie,” Castiel mumbled as he slid the third slice onto the plate.
“Uh huh,” she replied, unconvinced. “Do you at least have a ride home?”
Agnes gave him a small, relieved smile. “Yes, and, um.” She took a quick breath. “I had a question about your argument that Middle Eastern political comics at the turn of the twentieth century directly related to…”
“Ducks, huh?” said a voice to his left.
Castiel frowned at him. “I don’t understand. You’re already in my house.”
When Dean pulled to a stop in front of Castiel’s house, it was with a disbelieving grin. “Man,” he said as he stepped out of the car (“She’s my Baby,” he’d told Castiel earlier), “what’re the odds?”
enjoy ;)
“So, Dean, now you owe
Castiel began whistling the first Brandenburg Concerto, stopping when Dean’s smile made his own grin hard to fight.
Castiel tried to smile. “Yes, the food here is quite amazing.” He toyed with some romaine to distract himself.
“OW!” Castiel backed away, going around to the other side of the table so there was some space between them, completely bemused by Dean’s behavior. “How was I being—?”
and focused mainly on the way light was flickering across the TV screen and playing along Dean’s hands and arms. Castiel could feel the warmth emanating from Dean’s body, how it filled the space between them. Said space seemed to have been shrinking over the course of the evening, although he didn’t remember ever moving or feeling Dean move. Regardless, Castiel’s couch hadn’t been big to begin with, and now there were only a few inches between himself and his ex-nurse, and Castiel was very much aware of how easy it would be to lean in and close that space.
“Yes.” The vet gestured in the direction of her secretary, who was sitting at the front desk. “Linda can help you out.” She gave them both a wide, reassuring smile. “Bastet will be just fine, Mr. Novak. Don’t you worry.”
Dean flipped to the next page. “Oh, my God! Who’s that?” he demanded, pointing to a photo of a seven year-old Gabe sticking his finger into Castiel’s four year-old ear.
“I’m serious, Dean. From what you’ve been tellin’ me, I think he might be interested, but he might not be sure if he can make a move.” The sound of a toaster popping came over the line, followed by the chink of cutlery on a plate. “I mean, does he even know that you, y’know, aren’t… straight?”
(See the end of the chapter for
The next two days were a blur of tree decorating, lewd Christmas carol singing, and long, rambling country walks. Snow continued to threaten from the dim, charcoal sky, but it didn’t stop Dean and Bobby from rolling under the shop’s current project (a 1960s station wagon with original paneling) to tinker with this or that, or Dean from showing Castiel all of his and Sam’s old childhood haunts, like the frog pond at the bottom of the hill or the tyre swing over the creek. Castiel felt like he was treading through the history of this family and seeing everything that they’d experienced, and felt immensely honored to be able to do so.
“Uh huh,” Castiel mumbled, not making eye contact.
“To go to a drive-in or to neck in the backseat? Ohhhh.” Dean grinned as Castiel’s blush deepened. “Can’t believe you’ve never necked in the backseat. That’s like a teenage rite of passage.”
wasn’t on, and nothin’ else was good.”
Ten minutes later, Dean was sitting across from his partner, Anna, fervently trying to send her coded looks to communicate which cards he had in his hand. Castiel had tried his best not to laugh, but when Dean eventually stuck out his tongue and bulged his eyes, he couldn’t help it.
and, as always, hubrisandwax deserves all the llamas for being my ever-patient beta!
< Dean: She’s home and ready for visitors, if you aren’t on shift.
Dean cleared his throat again and he said, “Well… Cas and I, we…” He glanced at Castiel. “We’re, uh, together,” he finished lamely, swinging their joined hands as evidence.
Castiel made a garbled noise and gestured furiously at the piece of paper. “It’s not my fault your artistic vision is crucially impaired!”
> Hael: have fun making him better ;D
(See the end of the chapter for
Castiel had a sudden mental image of Dean sprawled naked across this very bed, moaning gutturally with his legs spread wide as he fucked himself with his own fingers, his firm cock leaking all over his stomach, and had to suppress a full-body shudder. He relieved his feelings by reclaiming Dean’s mouth with his own, sucking on Dean’s tongue with a vengeance.
“I, um.” Castiel swallowed. He’d never told a stranger this before, but quickly discovered that he didn’t give two shits about telling Dean. “It was — I came to terms with my sexuality. And my parents’ opinions didn’t exactly . . . favor . . . the person I was.”
Castiel stared at him. “You made this?”
The ‘anxiety thing,’ as Dean put it, dominated the rest of Castiel’s day. He met his new personal psychologist, Dr. Shurley, who was a skittish hobbit-like man (“Just call me Chuck,” was the first thing he said to Castiel) but was also, according to Dean’s reply to Gabe’s inquiring text, a “freaking genius.” After Dean had clocked out with a promise to return later that evening, Castiel started to feel rather lonely, especially when Chuck asked Gabe to leave the room and come back around lunch time. Gabe obeyed, promising Castiel that he’d bring back something sweet.
“Are you gonna sleep or what?”
Dean gritted his teeth; he could practically hear Sam’s smirk over the phone. “Shuddup, Sammy.”
He’d fought his hardest when it came to falling asleep that night, barely managing to make it through a handful of crackers and cheese for his dinner (the idea and scent of food had made him gag). When Dean had called him with a “Hey, Cas, how you doin’?” he’d replied with a hasty “Fine,” and said goodbye as quickly as he could, even though he could hear the way he was snubbing Dean, probably hurting him. But, he’d only managed to stay awake for over twenty-four hours very few times in his life, and he’d fallen asleep as he was sitting on his bed going through his notes, ripped awake by the dream not three hours later.
Anna raised an eyebrow. “Regardless of that, Gabe, where am I gonna sleep tonight?”
“I, um.” Castiel blinked. “About ten minutes from here.”
, he screamed internally.
“Mmkay.” But Dean didn’t look completely convinced. “She nice?”
She gasped as they reached the next floor, holding the door open for him. “What happened?!”
“‘Cause I live on Fulton. 2153.”
Her eyes widened with surprise: she had evidently lost track of time as well. “Oh! Yes. Um, maybe I could—”
The third weekend of December, the weekend after finals week at Oberlin, was a miniature hell for Castiel. He was swamped in grading, trying to power through all of his papers before he and Dean left for South Dakota; the last thing he wanted was to grade papers during his vacation. Dean had reinstated his old system of texting Castiel reminders to eat, sleep, and drink water, and Castiel had read each one with a smile.
The great day itself had arrived with a slow promise of activity. Castiel only had until noon to bake his pie, as Gabe had reminded him about a dozen times, since they were going to be eating around five or six in the evening. All the same, Castiel paced himself, leaving an extra half-hour to slowly make, chill, and roll out his special dough, telling himself that he was doing so to make sure that he didn’t mess anything up, but a tiny part of himself acknowledging that it kind of had to do with the fact that Dean was going to be eating this pie. By the time Castiel was standing over the sink peeling apples, Gabe wandered into the kitchen, half his hair sticking up and his pajama pants catching under his heels. “Mornin’,” he said gruffly, making a beeline for the coffee maker.
Coming with a half-stifled yell, Castiel threw his head back against the pillow as Dean shuddered and swallowed, his mouth working against Castiel’s cock.
But Gabe’s attention was elsewhere, and he stepped into the living room, appraising everything with a short whistle. “Classy digs, Cassie. And you kept it nice and toasty.” He turned, noticed Dean on the couch, and stopped short before grinning. “So I see I’m not the only snow-bound loser here.”
“You’re ill,” Castiel reminded him. “And I have to bank the fire, so it won’t stay as warm. I don’t want you relapsing, or getting worse. That, my friend, is why you are a marshmallow.”
Dean stood still for a few moments, his gaze locked on Castiel. “What kind of snow is your favorite snow?” he finally asked.
Gabe shook his head dismissively. “Michael can’t punch to save his life. And besides, I got to break his nose.”
hubrisandwax is a goddess. hope you enjoy the chapter ;)
It took about another hour for the crowds to die out in earnest. It was nearing nine o’clock when there came Dean’s usual knock at the door. Castiel opened it with a grin, which faded when he saw Dean up-close.
and HUBRISANDWAX IS A GODDESS AND YOU SHOULD ALL BOW DOWN TO HER just sayin'. she made this mess readable. forever indebted <3 <3 <3
Castiel shrugged. “Not really, I don’t have a—stop! That’s—that’s fine.”
Castiel’s hand missed the couch arm just as his leg slid off the cushions and he had a brief sensation of falling before he hit the floor with a loud
“Ladies and gentlemen, we will now begin boarding American Airlines flight 7493 to Chicago. Those with ‘A’ boarding passes, please line up according to the number you see on your ticket. Thank you.”
The first night on his own had been rough. Instead of just knocking him out, the pain meds had only made his dreams weirder, and Castiel was hopping around with only about five hours of sleep. He’d spent half the night and most of the day working through his collection of old movies, halfway convinced that watching
Dean stopped, staring at him. “Really?”
“And,” Dean said pointedly, ignoring Castiel, “the oatmeal made my throat stop hurtin’.”
Castiel ignored him. “Do you have any queens?”
She smiled. It was small, but endearing. “That’s because you’re riding the high of Tylenol Number Three. But you’d say you’re feeling better than you were this afternoon, wouldn’t you?”
Gabe took his hand and shook it, giving Dean a sly appraisal. “You, too.” He let go of Dean’s hand and shot Castiel a quick look before saying: “So how’d you manage to get stuck here? The storm hit during the night, didn’t it?”
“I could. I’d be awesome at it.”
“Yeah. I heard it.” Castiel turned back to the counter, his jaw working. He popped open the can with more vigor than was necessary, and some of the Beef Feast in Gravy splattered onto the tiles.
Dean raised his hand. “I second that. We need pie.”
Dean smiled and typed back:
Dean smiled back. “Gotcha.”
Castiel shot Dean a look. “It was Spiderman, and I was eleven.”
“Yes,” Castiel lied. “I’ll be perfectly fine. Although I’m not sure that being in a hospital is conducive to the best night’s sleep.”
Hael stood up from her desk, smiling inquisitively. “And to what do I owe this pleasure?”
Dean pulled back and regarded Castiel carefully. “That a good ‘oh’ or a bad ‘oh’?”
“We haven’t done that since we were little, Bobby.” Sam followed Bobby to the staircase.
Dean smirked. “If I have to.”
“I’m sorry to have to ask this question, Castiel,” she said, her tone a tad more gentle. “But what kind of abuse did you sustain from your older brother?”
>Dean: i hope u have a really good first day. they’ll love u, i promise.
“I’m down,” Dean said with a grin, reaching for another pig-in-a-blanket. “S’better than drawin’ pictures.”
“Sounds good,” Castiel managed, unsteady on his crutches. “If, uh, it’s okay, I’m gonna…” He gestured behind himself and in the direction of the house.
Castiel suppressed a shudder and bit his pillow before replying. The distance between them was killing him. “Not much to say, really. Remember how I said my parents were kind of extreme?” Dean mumbled in affirmation and Castiel closed his eyes as he continued. “Well, when I was six, I did something. And apparently it was something really bad, or it was bad according to my dad, because he just lost it. I’d never seen him like that before, and I never saw him act that way again. But, he just grabbed me, and told me that I’d be punished for my sins.” He swallowed; his throat felt paper-dry. “We already lived in a pretty rural area, but he just drove out in the middle of absolute nowhere. Some forest or other. And he took me out and walked me… into the trees. We walked for about half an hour, or, at least, I thought we did. It took me a long time to realize that I was alone, and had been for some time.” He forced himself to take a breath. “He left me alone in the woods so I could think about what I’d done, and I had to find my own way out. You can imagine how that went. I was… by myself for an entire day. Completely lost. Terrified. And cold. Really cold. That’s the one thing I remember most. I didn’t even have a jacket. When my mom came home that night and found the both of us gone, she called the police and started a search. Turned out that my dad had just walked back to his car and waited for me to reappear, never bothering to go looking for me, even though it got dark. He said that I needed time alone to repent my sins and beg God for forgiveness. They found me an hour or so later, around nine o’clock. I was… curled up under a tree, apparently. And shivering. And I had filled my pockets with feathers and pebbles, and I’d given them all names.” Castiel almost smiled. “My mother and the police tore into my father, but he just tuned them out. It was very much a turning point in my parents’ relationship. I don’t think my mother ever trusted my father again. Not that she should’ve.” Castiel paused, one of his hands twisted into the duvet. “And that’s…”
Dean frowned at the television, Bastet settled comfortably in his lap. “C’mon, Suzanna, don’t listen to that creep, you deserve better,” he chided the woman on-screen.
i've never had to do this before, but content warning for mentions of physical and verbal abuse, instances of panic attacks, and severe anxiety attacks. and just some really nasty language.
“Shhhh,” Dean shushed him, almost as if he could hear Castiel’s internal monologue. “Tryin’ t’sleep.”
“Yeah, there wouldn’t be much of a class without those. Hael, I’ll see you at lunch?”
“Look, I…” Dean seemed to chew over his words before he figured out how to say them. “I’d never told anyone about… what happened to me. The whole why-I-became-a-nurse thing. I mean, yeah, my brother and Bobby know because they’re my family, but none of my friends know. Except for you.” He swallowed thickly, staring at Castiel. “I was an asshole. I know. What I said was a dick thing of me to say. But I couldn’t handle it, okay? I didn’t know how to handle the fact that you knew the truth about me. So I bolted.” He held out his arms in defeat. “I’m sorry, Cas. I’m sorry.”
Dean gave Castiel a weak smile. “Sounds great, Cas.” He raised his left hand in a final wave. Castiel nodded in return, and a moment later, Dean pushed the passenger door closed. Trapped in the car, Castiel stared at the blurry outline of Dean’s body for a moment before he shifted back into first. “Right,” he said aloud. “Fuck this.” He pulled away from the curb, bypassing his house, and gunned for the center of the city.
His heart pounding, Castiel reached for Bastet, careful not to touch the bloody gash on her side. Her heart was beating so quickly that it felt like a flutter, her flank heaving as she breathed. “When did this happen?”
“Yeah, but…” Dean followed Castiel, still bemused. “You’re taking her to school?”
Dean let out a laugh. “Yeah! Hey.” He nudged Castiel’s knee. “Looks like we’re neighbors, man.”
“Yeah, goodnight,” Sam added.
Gabe nodded, shoving his hands into his pockets. “I’ll hit up the cafeteria, see if they’ve got anything good.”
“Why weren’t you gonna tell me?”
“You wouldn’t be. I have to eat dinner at some point, too, and today’s special is Chicken Tortilla Soup.” RN Sally caught Castiel’s confused look and added, “It’s basically ambrosia, only more Mexican. They make double the amount because it’s so popular. If you want a sandwich or something, it wouldn’t be any trouble.”
Castiel had stopped counting his mugs of coffee by the time he hit forty, although by Wednesday he thought the number might’ve been close to sixty, at the lowest. He couldn’t remember the last time he’d eaten something (
cuddle, okay?”
“Gabe—” Castiel wheezed.
“I’m going to bed,” Castiel announced as they walked in through his front door. He tugged off his trench and hung it on the coat stand before trudging into the living room and picking up his book.
The next twenty-four hours were a bit of a blur for Castiel. He ate one of the best burgers he’d ever had (Gabe reappeared a half-hour later panting and clutching two bulging paper bags: “Sorry I’m late—the cafeteria wasn’t really into doing cheeseburgers so I went to that diner you really like—”), got a fantastic night’s sleep (with Gabe insisting on spending the night on the sofa in the corner, which he had apparently done
Castiel let out a long sigh, ignoring the way it wrenched his side. He knew Dean was lying, because his orthopod wasn’t even here, but the message was clear. “I don’t really have a choice here, do I?”
The fracture may be treated with a short leg cast or a removable brace. Usually, you need to avoid putting weight on your leg for approximately 6 weeks.
Castiel huffed and vented his feelings by pinching a pillow. He didn’t want to have the dream again, much less in front of Dean.
“Yes. I’m actually very good at making pies.” Castiel swung a small bag of potatoes into the cart before using his crutches to continue down the aisle. “My apple pie actually won a local competition back in the day.”
“Thank you.” Michael’s slick smile returned as he closed the folder but didn’t stand up, locking his gaze on Castiel. “So, little brother, how’s the new job?”
Only two students showed up during his office hours, for which Hael silently thanked the gods she’d heard Castiel mention over the months as she glumly ate the rejected parts of Castiel’s lunch. Each of his visitors left looking slightly wary, if not worried about their Professor.
“No,” Castiel insisted. “I don’t. You’re already working yourself too hard, and you need to get better the right way. Just stay here tonight and work on kicking this cold or flu or whatever in the balls.” He paused. “Besides, Bastet’s been wanting you to sleep over for quite a while.”
2: who *wouldn't* want to be stuck in a snowstorm with dean OR cas?!?
Castiel fumed silently, but Dean wasn’t wrong. He could feel his injuries much more keenly now that his meds were fading. The rough ache in his right ankle, the sharp tug whenever he breathed, the sting of the cuts along his leg. At least they were enough to distract him from Dean, because scrubs shouldn’t be that flattering.
Dean stared at Castiel, his eyes glassy from the fever. “Okay,” he eventually mumbled. He let go of Castiel’s sleeve. “I’ll get changed.”
“Of course,” Dean assured him, feeling an unhelpful little flutter in his belly. He reeled off his phone number for Gabe, and a moment later, heard his own phone
“Whoa there, Deano.” Garth turned his attention to his fellow RN. “Whatcha doin’ over there?”
Dean found himself grinning again. “She’s great. More’n ready to be driven.” He noticed the folded piece of paper clenched in Castiel’s hand. “Whatcha got there, Cas?”
“I . . . I think so. A friend.” Castiel belatedly wondered if he could call Dean his friend.
Garth hmmed and reached over, his long fingers plucking the CD player away from Dean and running over the player’s shiny plastic surface. He tried a few buttons, then popped open the battery compartment on the bottom.
Dean made an altogether pornographic noise as he bit into his burrito; Castiel hurriedly dropped a napkin across his lap and tried to focus on his salad.
“What?!” Gabe squawked from the other room. “Why is your cat in a cast?! Jesus, Cassie, this is why you need to pick up your phone more often—”
“Thanks,” he said, and he meant it. “And thank you for driving all the way out here. We could’ve just had it shipped by a company, you know.”
boring.” She reached for the doorknob and pushed open the door, revealing her small office area, quaint and decorated with a variety of crocheted accessories and small indoor plants. The window on the far wall looked down on the sunny, teeming quad. “Does your foot hurt when it rains?”
“You’re kinda weird,” Dean replied, moving to sit down on the armchair, which he did with a huge ‘fluuumf.’ “But it’s okay. I still like you.”
“That’s irrelevant.” Michael pulled out a few papers from the folder. “You just have to sign these legal agreements confirming that the change was made with your consent, and I’ll be on my way.”
Dean let out a low whistle as he stepped through the doorway to Castiel’s office. “Fancy digs.”
The first thing Castiel was aware of was being thirsty. He mumbled a little, his tongue thick in his mouth, the skin above his right eyebrow itching and, a moment later, aching. But he felt… softness, mostly. His limbs were heavy and stiff, but he felt the whisper of woven fabric against his skin, the firmness of a mattress under his legs and against his back, and a point of discomfort in the crook of his left elbow. He slowly blinked awake, the room in front of him coming into focus.
“Cas!” Alarmed, Dean reached for Castiel’s hands, wrapping an arm around his back. “What’s goin’ on?!?”
“—yeah, and then I’m gonna head out. I hit up Garth this morning and he’s gonna be here with my jacket soon so I can finally go home.” There was a pause. “No, I just wanna get outta here as soon as I can. Of course Cas is a great guy, I just— I need some space, y’know? Yeah, yeah, I gotcha. You’ve already told me what, ten times? Yeah, just until he wakes up, then I’m outta here—”
Castiel ignored the way their fingers brushed as he took both cups. He tossed back the pill and swallowed it with a mouthful of water.
enjoy <3
“Stuff it, Cas,” Dean said, but he was grinning. “Y’know, I never pegged you for a Gene Kelly type of guy.”
“I think I’m gonna head up to bed,” Sam said as he stretched, reminding Castiel of a sleepy golden retriever.
Fifteen minutes later, Dean left with both plates, assuring Castiel that he wasn’t offended, that more leftovers was a good thing, and that he’d come by to check on him tomorrow.
“Um.” Castiel sifted sluggishly through his memory. “I… suppose?”
“No, I won’t!” Gabe half-whispered back, lining his phone up to take a picture. “Besides, it’s for the Insta!” He paused and took the photo, glad that he’d remembered to turn the flash off. Gleeful, he quickly selected a filter (those two assholes were so pretty that the photo barely needed any editing) and typed out a caption, posting the photo a second later and tiptoeing back to Anna. “God. And to think they try to
Dean mumbled something in reply, but it was lost against the sound of the Rambler’s engine and the steady pounding of the rain.
Dean: original trilogy vs. second trilogy. she thinks the prequels r better but shes so wrong.
Dean exhaled, and a moment later, his posture softened. “All right. I’ll stop.” He leaned away a bit and Castiel immediately noticed the change in distance. “Are you gonna be OK?”
Dean blushed all the way to his ears. “Shuddup.”
,” Jodie said, nearly beaming at him as she waited for Castiel to finish the paperwork. “Planes never look safe to me, and I—”
Dean watched him warily. “What’s the history?”
“Nope,” Dean cackled, leaning further away from Castiel’s reach. Castiel was practically on top of Dean by this point, scrabbling to get ahold of the album. “This is too good!”
Castiel woke to the smell of bacon and a cold bed. He blinked, wondering who the hell was cooking him breakfast before remembering the previous night. The memory hit him like a slap and he sat up, mind flooding with recollections of mumbled confessions and a rather obscene amount of cuddling.
“Too true.” Dean set to work, his hand careful as he sketched out the preliminary outlines. “Have you changed your dressings yet today?”
“Amen to that.” Dean bumped his Coke bottle against Castiel’s empty milkshake cup. He raised a warning finger. “But if you fuck up this leather, I will end you.”
Castiel rolled his eyes but smiled, sitting up and pulling his rolling tray closer to himself, making sure not to crowd Bastet. “What’s wrong with the cafeteria food?”
Dean grinned and ducked his head, looking for a moment like the most sheepish ten year-old in the world. “It’s okay. They’re long movies, and it’s gettin’ late.”
“Hael, you are a goddess.” Castiel haphazardly tried to gather everything into his briefcase, almost dropping the handouts in the process. “Goddamn!”
They were sitting on Castiel’s couch in the same spots they had claimed the night before, with the TV on and tuned into reruns of Star Trek: The Next Generation. Castiel had sat patiently and gone through some of his notes on the Quran while Dean hmmed, swore, and grinned his way through two hours of looking for the car that he thought Castiel would like best. They’d already established that Castiel would like to switch things up and buy himself an old vintage car instead of another used and lackluster later model, despite the difference in how much money he’d have to spend on gas.
Dean shook his head but stood up, shouldering his duffel. They moved over to the line and stood in their respective number brackett; a few minutes later, their boarding passes were scanned and they, along with a trail of other people, were walking down the gangway to get to the plane.
, Castiel thought, resignedly swallowing the last mouthful of his soup,
“‘night, Cas,” they called back, almost in-sync.
“What’s your favorite kind of snow?”
Dean nodded. “Yeah, I’m drivin’ you home.”
— yes, this is worse than the tie-dye—”) but Castiel was very fond of it, having owned it since his freshman year of college.
“Neither can I,” Anna added, sending Dean a little wave from the couch.
Dean inhaled deeply, or as deeply as he could with his stuffed nose. “I do love bacon.”
Castiel banged the shot glass back down onto the wooden counter. “Another, please,” he said to the bartender, the edges of his words somewhat slurred.
Castiel responded with a garbled noise before plowing through most of the sandwich, only pausing to break off a few grapes and toss them into his mouth. By the time he was finishing off the last corner, Dean sat down with his own grilled cheese and a grin that was wider than usual.
Gabe nodded, pouring himself a massive mugful and dumping four scoops of sugar in it. He paused, the mug halfway to his mouth, and looked at Castiel, his eyes suddenly much more awake. “It doesn’t bother you?”
“Wait.” Dean stepped into the front entryway, dripping rainwater onto the wooden floor. “I’m comin’ with you.”
Dean replied a beat too late, coughing once before saying, “Yeah, there was usually one around. I think there still might be one around Bobby’s place. Actually, uh.” He chuckled, somewhat nervously. “I used to take girls to the drive-ins so we could neck in the backseat.”
Castiel stopped, taking everything in one last time, not knowing if something would change, if maybe they wouldn’t talk for a while because they couldn’t talk about the almost-happened. “Goodbye, Dean.”
“Good morning.” The words sounded harsh. “You made breakfast.”
Dean actually let out a growl before handing over his two. Castiel fought the urge to laugh.
Castiel raised an eyebrow as he came in from the kitchen, carrying two bowls of chili. “I thought you said you didn’t watch
> Dean Winchester: try again tomorrow
“If you weren’t, you’d be lyin’ in bed, moanin’ and gripin’ for all you’re worth.”
Castiel practically leapt off the couch, unable to believe it, because he knew that voice— he was at the front door in a second, fumbling with the locks. “Gabe, is that you?!”
“Cas?” The voice was closer now, and anxious. “Are you okay?”
“Yes,” Castiel said immediately. “I’ll do that. I’ll make a box.”
“...Yes?” Dean replied, cautious.
Castiel grinned. “Mine.” He ballooned the sheet over the seat cushions. “Besides, it’ll be nice to have someone help me with the cleanup tomorrow. These are for you.” He tossed the clothing to Dean. “There’s a spare toothbrush in the side drawer in the downstairs bathroom. Toothpaste, too.” He fluffed the pillow against one of the armrests and tossed the duvet out across the sheet.
He tried to smile at her. “Thanks.” He put down the pen and pushed through the doors, scanning the hallway until he saw a room lined with metal cages and emitting various whimpering and meowing sounds. He stepped into the sterile medical room, glancing around until he saw Bastet lying across the top of a pristine metal table, her side shaved and the gash sealed with neat little stitches. She was motionless, her eyes shut, breathing steadily under the influence of the sedative. Castiel leaned in closer and laid a careful hand on her shoulder, his thumb stroking the edge of her front leg.
, a Christmas present from Anna) and turned his attention to the Introduction. “So read your damn book.”
Castiel flushed from his ears to his toes and internally cursed. “Uh—”
Gabe owed Dean a two-years’ supply of free croissants by lunchtime and Castiel rubbed his eyes, wondering why he ever let Dean talk his brother into playing poker.
Dean sucked in a sharp breath, the sound obvious in the relative silence of the room. Castiel forced himself not to trace the sound to its owner. “Stockholm syndrome,” he murmured. “As long as she rejected me, she saved herself from Michael’s wrath.”
“Wait,” Dean said, his voice huskier than usual because of his illness. “What’re you doin’?”
“Did you make this bread?”
“That’s good.”
“It’s just…” Castiel took a breath and cast his gaze over the silent, frosted neighborhood that was shining brightly in the sudden fall sunshine. “It’s my favorite kind of snow. And it’s all melting, so it’ll be gone soon, but it’s just…” He sighed happily, momentarily forgetting the tension between himself and Dean. “It’s just beautiful.”
Castiel sighed and sat back, resigned to his fate. “That’s Gabe, my brother. He’s two years older than I am.” He pointed to the photo below it. “That’s me and Anna. She’s Gabe’s twin, but they couldn’t be more different from each other.”
“Thank you. For everythin’. Really. Thank you. You… were really nice to me, and you didn’t have to take care of me the way you did, but you still did it anyway, and you’re still takin’ care of me—” he gestured to the box “—anyway, I’m really lucky to, y’know…” He trailed off, his gaze darting to Castiel’s.
“I don’t like the pain meds. They make me feel fuzzy and disconnected. I hate feeling that way.”
She grinned. “Gotcha. The chef owes me a favor, anyhow. Fries?” With a chuckle, she added, “Never mind. I think I know the answer to that question.”
Dean let out a little ‘heh’ and Castiel awarded himself a point for getting Dean to cheer up. Then, there was a little buzz, and Dean pulled his pager out of his pocket with a grimace. “I gotta make rounds. You just do what you’re doin’, don’t go anywhere or break anythin’ until your brother gets back. At least then we could make him pay for the damages.” He was halfway out the door when he turned and added, “And don’t think you’re off the hook for ignorin’ me these past two weeks. Remember, I know where you sleep.” And then he was gone, striding down the hallway, looking far too good while doing so.
“Dean, I’m—” he managed to stutter out as a warning, feeling like he was going to explode. Dean looked up at him, lips wrapped obscenely around Castiel’s cock, pupils blown. Castiel tried to tug him off, writhing, but Dean just sucked harder.
He lay there for what felt like a small eternity, gradually calming down as he swallowed his tears and felt his heartbeat begin to slow.
They were just finishing their lunches and a discussion of the musical score for each respective
“Jesus.” Castiel shook his head, ashamed and somehow angry. “I’m sorry.”
He hadn’t really spoken to Dean since the snow-in, other than to reply to Dean’s quick text of: “home safe & sound. no pipes burst, lots of firewood, dont worry bout me.” But then the snow finished melting, the botched school week ended, and the weekend rolled around. It was nearing noon on the Sunday before Gabe’s departure the next day when Gabe decided to have an aneurysm about the NFL.
Dean clucked his tongue and reached for the pile of cards. “After this round, I’m callin’ quits. You’re too damn good at this game.”
“I’m fine, Dean,” Castiel replied, his voice rough and slightly slurred. He almost couldn’t meet that piercing green gaze. “Nothing hurts more than it should. And I’m not dizzy or anything.”
Castiel blinked, surprised yet again by Dean’s kindness. “I . . . okay.”
>Gabriel The Awesomest Ever: good luck today, lil bro. even if u fuck up, every god in the world is totally gonna save ur ass.
Dean nodded. “I’ve actually had to wake him up from a few of them.”
Castiel tried to smile back. “Goodnight, Dean.”
“So,” he summed up, “that’s why I’m here. Drowning my so-called sorrows.” He gave a self-deprecating laugh and raised his glass. “Pathetic, isn’t it?”
Bobby grunted. “Yeah, but traditions seem to hold in this family.” He turned to Castiel with a twitch of his beard. “Goodnight, you two. Don’t stay up too late.”
Castiel frowned, his gaze narrowing. “I am not
Dean went to put the books down on Castiel’s table before he took a good look around him. “Y’know,” he said, turning slowly on the spot to take everything in. “This school just gets prettier’n prettier.”
Tuesday was hellish, and he blacked out during lunch hour, managing to resurface in time for the appearance of one of his students and to be punctual  for a department meeting. As he fumbled his way out of the office, he gave himself a mental pat on the back for thinking of the car service idea. He had a different driver every time, and each one of them quickly learned not to ask any questions.
“Oh, am I?” Michael smirked, looking at Gabe like he was some kind of overzealous puppy before his cold, dark eyes locked onto Castiel, who started to shake in his seat.
Dean nodded in agreement, squishing the oatmeal experimentally with his spoon. Castiel reached for his own mug and dug into his oatmeal, watching Dean for a reaction. Dean raised the spoon to his face, giving the glob of oatmeal a once-over before taking a hesitant bite: his expression went flat as he chewed.
Castiel grinned widely. “Yes, Dean. Sounds like a plan.”
“Just so long as you don’t start kissing the floor—”
Dean prayed that he wasn’t blushing and reached into his backpack with a little cough. “Friend lent me a CD to listen to, and my car doesn’t have a CD player.”
Castiel nodded dumbly then snapped to attention. “Who told you that I like
“A friend. He’s visiting me for the day.” Castiel sent Dean a quick smile. “If you go and let Hael know that you’re ready, she’ll start showing you around.”
The nurse chuckled as she kept pace with him. “Sounds like a rom-com.” When Castiel didn’t reply, she glanced at him and noticed his blush. “Oh no. Did I just put my foot in my mouth?”
“All machines are ladies, Cas.” Dean stepped in, a glint in his eye. “You’re gonna have to pick a name for her soon.”
“Yes, Dean?”
“For?” Dean murmured drowsily, shifting his weight and wrapping his arm around Castiel. Octopus Dean was back.
“—and we were here, tallyin’ up, but I, uh, wasn’t feelin’ too great. I had this cold or flu bug and Cas noticed and he made me take some pills and sleep it off before I went home.” Dean lifted one shoulder in an easy shrug, somehow very calm. “When we woke up, we were buried in snow.”
Dean seemed to take the hint. He popped open his door and stepped out into the downpour.
“Huh.” Dean looked closely at the photographs, running a fingertip along the outlines of Castiel’s past, his touch light but curious. He turned to Castiel with a huge grin. “But you still haven’t told me why you were wearing a dress.”
Castiel held his gaze for a moment before continuing: “Why are you being so nice to me? I mean, I haven’t—” He shook his head. “I haven’t done anything to warrant it.”
Dean let out a little whoop as they cleared the gangway and walked into their arrival gate at Sioux Falls Regional Airport. “Hello, solid ground! God, it’s been too long.”
Dean shook his head as he smiled down at the frying pan. “I need to start writin’ down these quotes of yours. Outta context, they sound pretty damn weird.” He flipped the grilled cheese onto its uncooked side, the butter hitting the hot pan with a sizzle. “You can’t work on that all the time, you know. You gotta take breaks. You’re still in recovery, for cryin’ out loud.”
“No, I’m sorry, you’re right. This thing you have going with Castiel is one-hundred percent platonic. No sexual tension whatsoever.” Dean heard Sam’s barely restrained, derisive chuckle.
“Yeah, uh.” Dean coughed a little. “Let’s just say I had a rough adolescence. Things got worse after Dad died. I mean, Bobby was great. He was more than great. He was everything we needed. But I just didn’t handle it well.” He inhaled quickly. “I went down my dad’s path. Started drinkin’ like crazy. And then Sammy left… I really derailed after I turned twenty-two. Got wasted one night, drove myself home. But I hit somebody on the way. Nearly killed her.” He coughed again. “Shook me up bad enough that I turned myself around. Went stone-cold sober. Put myself through nursin’ school. I wanted to stop hurtin’ people and do just the opposite. I wasn’t good enough to be a doctor so I went for the next-best thing.” He was quiet for a moment. “It’s been about eight years now. I haven’t had a drink in eight years.” His hand shifted under the covers and he prodded Castiel in the back. “Your turn.”
Castiel grinned back on his way to the bathroom. “Yes, Dean. I own plaid.”
“Here.” Castiel held out the CD.
Castiel sighed. This was not worth the fight. “Don’t. Please.”
Castiel had braced himself for the heat and humidity but it still hit him like a wall. He exhaled, squinting in the sudden sunshine. It was blinding; he could barely see a thing beyond the overhang of the hospital.
Dean shook his head but kept on smiling. “Y’know, I’ve never listened to classical music. Well, not on purpose.”
Dean’s grip tightened. “Why’s he make you have panic attacks?”
. “You heard that?”
Dean paused when Castiel didn’t follow him, turning when he reached the front gate. “Are you… smilin’?”
“You okay?” Gabe asked him gently.
“You bet.” Gabe reached for Bastet, who had perked up from Castiel’s corner of the couch, and started rubbing her head with two fingers. “I haven’t eaten since last night. I could eat a damn horse, along with its hay.”
Castiel considered. “Somewhat uncomfortable.”
going to fall out of the sky.” Castiel wished that they were on a plane somewhere else, somewhere a little more liberal than South Dakota, because he wasn’t sure what would happen if he started cuddling Dean in public. “We aren’t even in the air yet.”
“Dean,” Gabriel continued loudly, as if Michael had never said anything, “this is our brother and resident dickbag, Michael. Great. We all know each other. Now, can we please get this joyful little reunion over with?”
“Were you not fine before?”
Castiel exhaled shortly and leaned back on the counter, crossing his arms against his chest. For a long, dragging moment, he was silent, turning everything over in his mind. He could hear the tick of the kitchen clock, Dean’s unsteady breathing, the caw of a crow on a nearby telephone pole. “I… I guess so,” he eventually said, feeling most of the tension leak out of his body. He lifted his eyebrows. “You gonna dick out on me again?”
Dean snorted but took the book anyway. “I don’t know what you’re thinkin’. I ain’t some whiz-kid when it comes to readin’.”
Dean’s stare jumped between the player and Garth. “What’d you do?!”
Castiel slid his hands into the pockets of his sweatpants. “Thanks, but I’m fine for now.”
Dean’s dimple appeared. “See you later, Cas.” And he closed the front door, the locks turning a moment later.
Castiel rolled his eyes but obliged. Dean took a careful look before nodding. “Clear.”
“So I dabbled a little in culinary school. What can I say?” Gabe refilled his mug with coffee and sugar. “But I’ve got one of the best bakeries in LA and one of the best food trucks, too. I ain’t exactly complaining.”
“Again, that was Gabe.” Castiel put the two bottles down on the table. “He’s fond of the whole hog.”
They had just settled into the episode and were debating the longevity of Dr. Sexy’s new fling when Gabe came sauntering in, a large black bag slung over one shoulder and his hands full of takeout containers. “Sup, boys?” he grinned as he closed the door.
“You can’t prove anything.” Castiel dug into his chili, automatically shifting so that his feet were intertwined with Dean’s.
“Do you have someone to pick you up?” she asked him. “Someone to help you out? Things can be a little difficult until you get used to being on crutches.”
Dr. Bradbury looked him over, brushing her short fringe out of her eyes. “They’re a little tall,” she said, crouching in front of him. He couldn’t see what she was doing, but then there was an odd popping sound, and his left crutch dropped an inch or so before clicking back into place. She did the same thing to his right crutch, and Castiel realized that he wasn’t so uncomfortable anymore. “That’s much better,” he acknowledged, and Dr. Bradbury straightened up with a grin.
Castiel swallowed very quickly and crossed to the classroom door, opening it wide to the eager crowd before him. “Good morning,” he greeted them, smiling as his students filed in. He got the usual cacophony of “Good mornings” before they were all inside and he was closing the door again.
Dean chuckled. “Yeah. Isn’t that the term?” He cupped the side of Castiel’s neck and slowly ran his thumb along Castiel’s jaw, his pupils widening as he did so.
“I can see you doing that,” Castiel snapped; Gabe and Dean hastily dropped their gazes.
Dean was chuckling under his breath, holding his hands up in a placating gesture. “Easy there, twitchy. S’not the first time someone’s fallen asleep on me.”
“Dean, wait,” Castiel protested, “I can’t let you just—”
Castiel redirected his frown to his brother. “Why should it?”
“How are you feeling, Mr. Novak? Any better?”
“—and you don’t know a damn person in this city,” Dean continued as if Castiel had never interjected. He shook his head. “I’ve told you that about ten times by now, Cas. Don’t ask me to tell you again.”
Eventually, when Castiel’s skin became too hypersensitive, and he felt like everything was too much, almost overwhelming, he bit his lip and wrapped his fist around Dean’s cock, bracing his weight against his other arm and gazing into Dean’s eyes. He increased his pace steadily, keeping eye contact, getting lost in the dark green of Dean’s gaze.
“Fair’s got nothing to do with it.” Gabe took a step closer to Michael. “Why d’you have to push his buttons? Haven’t you done enough already?”
“To whom?” Castiel hedged.
Castiel shook his head. “Nothing.” He leaned in closer and started to work on the buttons, slower than he had before. “You’re… just… the most…”—he punctuated his words with kisses to Dean’s exposed torso—“... beautiful… person… I’ve ever known.” He tilted upwards to land a final, almost chaste kiss to Dean’s mouth. Only then did he notice that Dean was trembling, his green eyes boring into Castiel’s like his life depended on it.
“That would be my brother, Gabe,” Castiel chimed in as he hesitantly stepped into the house, dragging his suitcase along behind him. “He and my sister stayed with me for a little while when I wasn’t feeling very well. Gabe’s a chef in L.A. and likes feeding people.”
Dean considered Castiel for a moment before replying: “Your mom.”
“But.” Castiel took an unsteady breath, staring at Dean, who was wonderfully close. “Aren’t you straight?”
Meg cleared her throat and slowly walked out the door. “If only someone would make good on that promise.”
“Whoa, Cas,” Gabe cut him off with a small grin. “I don’t think he needs the full biography.”
4: if you get the "thornberry" reference you're my new favorite
Dean gave him a triumphant grin, or a watered-down version of one, anyway. “Hundred and twenty-seven. Beat that, Brucie.”
“I’ll just come in with you. I don’t wanna do that drive alone.” Dean met Castiel’s gaze and raised an eyebrow. “Why? How early do you get there?”
Castiel stood up, shoving his lunch to the side. “Come in, Raj, come in.”
“Trick or treat!” chimed the chorus of second graders in front of him, most of them so bundled up that he could barely discern their faces, let alone their costumes. He was just thankful that his Batman costume was thick and had lots of padding. The day before, Ohio had been sent into a ridiculously random cold snap, turning one of the last weeks of autumn into what felt like deep winter, minus the snow. But, in spite of the freezing air and harsh wind, the kids were out in full force, their parents trailing behind them in parkas and balaclavas.
“You’re most welcome. Now.” She used her free hand to reach for the crutches. She tucked them under Castiel’s armpits and he instinctively caught hold of the hand grips. “How does that feel?”
Castiel nodded. “But I’m a better baker.”
Castiel stifled a hiccup and returned his gaze to the glass of beer in front of him. “
Dean pulled out of the hug but held his brother at arm’s length. “You need to stop growin’,” he said shrewdly. “I’m supposed to be the tall one here.” He gave Sam an appraising look. “Hey, you asked out that girl yet? What was her name? Jennifer?”
“Dean.” Castiel almost smiled. He stepped back and held the door open. “She’s on the couch. And be gentle.”
Castiel could only blink for a moment because that wasn’t at all what he’d thought Dean would ask him. “Coming back, I think.” He flexed his right hand experimentally and was pleased to see the way it curled in and out of a fist. He started trying to move his feet and smiled when they bent and stretched accordingly under the covers. “Is it normal that I couldn’t really move?”
“Nope,” Castiel hedged. “You should give the castle spikes on the walls. And then put the decapitated heads of the Damned on the spikes.”
“Yes,” Dean replied as he pulled two plates out of the cabinet by the sink. “I hope you like Pad Thai.”
Dean looked up from Castiel’s favorite recording of the Brandenburg concertos, his gaze genuine. “Yeah. Maybe it is.”
He kissed Dean’s mouth once, tender. “Thank you.”
Dean gave himself a quick shake. “Nothin’.” He took a massive bite of his burrito. “So you’re cool with me just hangin’ out in here while you do your thing?”
“Professor Novak?” It was one of the freshman in his Intro seminar. Castiel mentally searched for her name as she tucked a bright pink strand of hair behind her ear. “I know it’s the first day and everything—”
Dean actually rolled his eyes. “Stuff it, Cas. I’m offerin’, and it’s not like I had anything else to do with my day.” He glanced at Castiel. “I’m gonna have to make a new rule against protestin’. I’m here because I want to help you Cas, so stop tryin’ to talk me out of it.” He shook his head. “It isn’t wrong to need help.”
“What?” Castiel asked him, wiping his hands on a napkin.
Something fell to the floor with a
The nurse shook his head and finished adding something to Castiel’s chart. “I really hate people sometimes.”
“Really?” Dean turned to Castiel, surprised but still grinning broadly. “What you been sayin’ about me?”
Dean surrendered her with a frown. “Sweater?”
“You make me sound so dramatic!”
“Hold on,” Dean murmured, his voice huskier than usual. He leaned over to the bedside table, his hair glowing white in the moonlight, and dug around in the drawer. With a small “huh” of victory, he pulled out a half-empty bottle of lube and a condom. Dean closed the drawer and wiggled back into place, his shit-eating grin wide. “Knew I’d have it.”
don't kill me!
“Cas,
“Okay, so,” Dean turned Castiel’s laptop so they could both see the screen, “I think these are some of your best options.”
is my favorite show.” And he winked before settling back in his chair, Castiel numbly glad that they’d muted his heart monitor for the time being because
“Well, tough, ‘cause I’m gonna roll up in front of this hospital whether you like it or not.” Dean held Castiel’s gaze for another moment before slumping a little. “C’mon man,” he said, his voice softer. “Let me help you.”
Castiel spent lunch at what he privately christened the Religion Geeks Table. He was reacquainted with his department, the ten men and women he’d likely be spending the next ten years with, and chatted with them about how the new Catholic Pope was redefining the ethics of Catholicism and the new theories swimming around about extremism in America. He left for his office hours feeling thoroughly at home.
Castiel swallowed. “Um.” He mentally scrambled for an answer. “I, um. Yes. Kind of. Maybe.”
“Call it what you want, but I heard the snorin’.” Dean pressed a tiny paper cup into Castiel’s left hand and another cup of water into his right. “Here you go. Dose up.”
Dean ruefully shook his head at the large amount of cards in his hands. “If we were playin’ poker, I’d be up fifty bucks by now.”
“Man, I don’t know.” Dean groaned. “Dammit. My house keys were in the pocket.”
“No, of course. Come in.” He capped his pen and pushed his draft aside, gesturing to the small table in the corner. Agnes. That was her name. “What did you have a question about?” He sat down at the table.
“A surprise.” Dean dropped the plastic bag on Castiel’s kitchen table.
“Yeah,” Castiel replied drily. “And I’m the Queen of England. Look, just hang tight for a moment, okay?” Dean nodded, and Castiel quickly made his way to the downstairs bathroom, pulling out the bottle of acetaminophen he always kept handy. He shook out a few pills and filled a glass with water. A moment later, he was pressing the pills into one of Dean’s hands and the glass into the other. “Come on. Drink.”
Gabe’s laugh sounded a tad forced, his eyes betraying his concern. “Listen, Cas… What’s going on? I know that when I left, things weren’t, y’know, a hundred percent okay, but I had no idea they were bad enough to land you in here.”
He wasn’t expecting a quick reply, but less than a minute later:
Dean shrugged. “Not really, so long as you’ve got a space heater so you don’t give yourself pneumonia.” He shot Castiel a grin. “But the machinery can get a little uncooperative, I guess.”
Castiel actually seemed to wince at the sight of food and he gave her a reluctant smile. “Thanks, Hael, but I’m really not in the mood to eat—”
Castiel stared at his brother. “Are you insane?”
When Dean was satisfied and Jodie was looking triumphant, she handed Castiel a thin sheaf of papers to cement their transaction and a pen. “So did you fall out of a tree or trip over a cat?”
Dean shot him a guilty look as he tossed the trash into the medical waste bin. “Sorry, Cas. Can’t do that yet. I’m not sure when you’re gonna be discharged, but the Docs might wanna kept you under observation for, uh, y’know… the anxiety thing. They don’t want you faintin’ again.”
Castiel shut his mouth and stared down at the polished oak of the bar, trying to think. His mind was a whirling mess of confusion, embarrassment, and sheepishness, but before he knew it, his mouth was opening again and he was saying, “Yes.”
“Shut up,” Gabe snapped. “You lost the right to be in his life years ago. You need to leave.”
*flings words at you* here have a super long chapter!
Dean took the hint and quieted down; Castiel closed his eyes and wondered what good could come of this. A moment later, he felt Dean’s warm foot press against his, and bit his tongue to ignore how much he wanted it.
“Is it harder to work on cars in the cold?” Castiel asked as they set off around the house and towards the garage that was about twenty yards away.
Castiel realized the veracity of this statement when the front door swung open to reveal an elderly, bearded man who was dressed almost exactly like Sam and Dean (Castiel reasoned that a preference for plaid must run in the family) and wearing a raggedy baseball cap even though it wasn’t sunny. He looked Castiel up and down. “So this is Cas, huh?”
Castiel had been diagnosed with anxiety disorder, most likely rooted in PTSD. Chuck had said this gently, his eyes kind and a little wary, but it hadn’t really shocked Castiel or upset him. To him, it made perfect sense: the trauma of his childhood had been damaging, and it was time for him to face it, to talk about it, to be honest with himself and those who were important to him.
“Okay.” Castiel let out a little laugh of relief. “You’re on.”
Castiel’s tongue felt like it was ten pounds and he blinked slowly, trying to get the black spots to go away. “Yessss,” he managed as the spinning got even worse, the ground seeming to tremble beneath him, “I’m fine.” And then he was falling and everything was gone, gone, gone.
Castiel met his gaze and smiled tentatively. They sat there in companionable silence for a few moments before Dean cleared his throat and looked down at his cards. “Got any sixes?”
Garth shrugged loosely. “One of your batteries was loose. That’s all.” He smiled at Dean’s indignant expression before adding, “Hey, why do you have a CD player? I’ve only ever seen you listen to tapes on that Walkman of yours.”
“You belong on the stage.”
“You got it.” Dean smiled at him, one hand on his front door.
“I know, boss.” Hael went back to her desk and slid open one of the top drawers, pulling out a small stack of miscellaneous cat necessities, like cans of Fancy Feast and toys. “I’m basically a vet at this point.”
“Of course I want this.” Castiel shifted, sitting up slightly so he could kiss Dean again. “Nothing else could convince me otherwise,” he murmured against Dean’s skin, loving the way Dean shivered in response. “Now.” He shifted again, feeling the distinct presence of Dean’s cock against his hip before gently rolling Dean off of him and pressing Dean down into the pillows. “I think you should let me return the favor. As a Christmas present.”
Castiel smiled, underlining a phrase that he particularly enjoyed. “Didn’t think you would.” He turned to look up at Dean. “But do you have a favorite yet?”
“Okay. We’ll be there in ten minutes.” Dean hung up, turning his wide gaze on Castiel. “Amy,” he said, answering Castiel’s unspoken question. “She went into labor at the supermarket. They’ve taken her to Lutheran Hospital.”
in silver letters. “It actually made things a bit boring.”
Castiel tried to smile, noticing the absence of Dean’s hands on his body and hating it. “Just me being an idiot. Sorry about falling asleep.”
Nausea rolled through Castiel’s stomach at Dean’s words. He didn’t need to hear any more.
He closed the front door and wandered back into his living room where Dean was sitting on the couch, nursing his own glass of water.
“Here he is!” Jo called out to someone. “With crutches and everything!”
The wrinkle in Dean’s forehead deepened. “Why were you gettin’ drunk?”
Bobby took this all in with a nod. “Makes sense.” He nodded in the direction of what Castiel assumed was the kitchen. “Made sandwiches. Just grab what you want.”
now that i'm not in endless tech weeks anymore and got into college, i have a lot more time on my hands :) so updates should be happening more frequently. i don't really have a ballpark for how many chapters are left, but i do know the story arc. i'm not one for super long fics, though, so i don't imagine this going over 20/22 chapters. at most.
But, of course, it didn’t stop, and the world was still spinning as the driver pulled up outside 2154 Fulton Road.
Castiel chuckled, noting that the nurse was missing his ID badge. How . . . unhelpful. “I suppose so.”
Dean looked at him for a long moment, his expression worked into something Castiel couldn’t identify, before he was closing the distance between them, his stride purposeful and intent. He stopped about six inches away from Castiel and took a breath, his eyes widening… before he pointedly reached forward and flicked Castiel on the forehead.
Castiel took his dismissal and trudged back across the road, soaking in the blank slate of the snow and a small part of him wishing that the snowstorm had never ended. He reached his porch, toed off his snowshoes, and opened the front door, jumping when he saw Gabriel leaning against the doorway to the living and dining rooms, Bastet in his arms.
“Are too,” Dean replied, managing to lift all the bags of groceries at once.
“No, I’ve got some work to do,” Castiel replied, trying to sidestep the question. For whatever reason, he hadn’t had the dream last night, and he didn’t want to risk the possibility of it returning full-throttle and worse than it usually was. “I should really finish it while I can.”
“I realized that there were other religions out there. And, upon exploring them, I discovered that some of those religions offered truths that were more appealing to me than those of the Christian God. I never really regained my faith, but it was an enlightening experience.” Castiel shrugged. “I also tried looking on the Bible as a work of literature instead of a book of judgment, and then it became terribly engrossing. I’ve read it at least a dozen times.”
Castiel stared at him. It seemed that Dean was going to have his own way regardless of what Castiel thought. “Um. Okay.”
“Why—?”
“Open your pie hole. I gotta see if you swallowed it.”
Castiel entered the room with a hesitant tread and immediately tried to clear off his desk. “Sorry, it’s been a while since I’ve straightened up—”
“Say what you like,” Gabe had said after one such protest, his eye scanning the list of ingredients on a bag of locally-made wheat flour, “but you didn’t see the way he was looking at you.”
“Same here.” Jodie shrugged. “Perk of being a car-collector-slash-mechanic is that I get lots of excuses to drive.”
“Great!” Dean stepped past him and headed for the kitchen, calling out a greeting to Bastet, who meowed in response. Bewildered and unconvinced that this wasn’t a hallucination, Castiel followed him, running into the kitchen doorway in the process.
Castiel hurriedly closed the door, slipping on the snow that had melted into his floorboards before stepping into the living room. “Gabe, this is my neighbor and good friend Dean.” He avoided Dean’s gaze as he continued: “Dean, this is my brother Gabriel. He owns a bakery out in California and makes lots of different kinds of pastry and he kind of has this girlfriend named Kali but they’ve never really—”
Dean was standing on the welcome mat, shifting his weight from foot to foot and giving Castiel a nervous little smile. “Hey, Cas.”
“This one’s a nineteen-sixty Nash Rambler, white paint with original tan leather interior. Owner says the engine might need a little touchin’ up, but I can take care of that easy. This other one here’s a nineteen-sixty-four Ford Falcon, also white with a brown leather interior. Rims look good but there’s some minor crackin’ around the steerin’ wheel. And this last one is a nineteen-sixty-one Chevy Nova, light blue paint with a white leather interior; it’s got a few cracks around the dash but the engine’s in great condition. So, just goin’ off of first impressions, which car d’you like best?”
Castiel shook his head. He wondered whether Dean was telling the truth about raising his younger brother, because that wasn’t something that you just threw around in casual conversation. “I don’t even like pudding.”
Bobby raised an eyebrow before he shook Castiel’s hand, his grip firm and quick. “I like him,” he said to Dean. “He’s got manners.”
Dean shrugged, trying to pull off nonchalance despite the tense line of his shoulders. “The night that Bastet got hurt, I uh… I couldn’t sleep. I heard the Rambler and I saw someone go into your house with you, so I just kind of assumed…” He shrugged again and took a sip of his Coke.
Gabe quickly flipped his phone back around so he was filming himself and said, “We are gonna eat the bejeezus out of this thing. Stay tuned.” Then he flipped his phone right-way round and quickly tapped a few buttons before putting his phone down.
Dean snorted, finishing off Bugs Bunny. “There ya go.” At this point, Castiel’s cast sported a host of different Loony Tunes characters and a couple of Smurfs.
“Cas, I—” Dean’s hand was at his shoulder, turning him back around. “That wasn’t what I meant, okay?! I didn’t mean it!”
< Dean: Oh yeah?
Castiel felt a sudden urge to salute. “Yes, sir.” He held out his right hand for the second time that day. “I’m thrilled to meet you at last.”
“Most certainly not.” Gabe heaved a sigh and slid Bastet’s food dish in front of her (she dug in with a purr). “Dammit!” He knocked the empty can into the sink, causing Bastet to flinch and cast him an indignant look. “Why did the bastard have to show his face? God,
No response. Castiel checked his phone again a minute later, but he hadn’t missed a text. He started to frown, wondering what kind of signal this was, when a sudden, sharp knock sounded at his front door. Grinning, he opened it to reveal a boyishly excited Dean, who shot him a quick, “Hey Cas, how ya doin’?” before handing him a large bag of chips (which, Castiel guessed, was their lunch), tossing off his coat, and heading for the couch. Gabe greeted him with a cheer and a hand-slap thing before they settled into Sports Center, starting a discussion of the two teams and automatically spreading Bastet between both of them so they could each get a good handful of tummy fur.
“I will,” he promised.
“I’m not bein’ ridiculous. I’m comin’ with you.”
> Dean: R U WATCHIN G THE GAME
“She’s a liar,” Dean said instantly. “Keep the beard.”
Castiel frowned at the sink, reaching for the next unpeeled apple. “What do you mean?”
OH - so here's the follow-up to the cliff-hanger :)
Castiel glared at the ceiling. He hated hospitals. He hated being injured. He especially hated meeting an extraordinarily beautiful person when a catheter was involved.
, snuggling into blankets and pillows as a light snowfall began to dust the ground outside. From there, they moved on to a few choice episodes of
Hael smiled and slid her arm through his. “Then I guess it’s a good thing I came along.”
“Sammy had bad nightmares when he was a kid. This was the only thing that helped.” Dean waited for Castiel to move, and when he didn’t, Dean sighed. “The least I can do is be here to wake you up before it gets really bad. That’s better than nothin’, isn’t it?”
Dean waved away his gratitude. “S’nothin’, man.” He reached up to cover a yawn, and a small piece of Castiel deflated.
Flummoxed, Dean sat back down on the couch, wondering what Michael had done to make Cas that nervous.
“Did you just insult the sun in ancient Hebrew?”
“I know,” he sighed. “But it was worth a shot.”
He’d learned about the curly fries from Michael’s Diner and that chocolate milkshakes made Dean grin for hours. He’d learned about Led Zeppelin and AC/DC and why Indiana Jones was the best thing to ever happen (other than Luke Skywalker). He’d learned about the small scar under Dean’s chin (“bike accident”) and why a case of root beer should always be present in his fridge, even if Castiel preferred Dr. Pepper or Pepsi, because Castiel’s taste in soda was just “plain goddamn awful, Cas, I mean really, it’s embarrassin’.” He’d learned that sunrises are better than sunsets (“Cas, you should see the way the light hits the east wing in the mornin’, ‘specially up in Pediatrics. That’s where we take the kids who can’t sleep. Makes ‘em smile.”) and that Dean was a fastidiously neat person (he’d taken one look at Castiel’s desk and visibly shuddered) and that changing bandages was one of Dean’s favorite things about being a nurse (“I like doin’ this,” he’d said, smiling down at the nearly-healed cut on the side of Castiel’s knee. “Feels like you just fell off the monkey bars and I’m the one makin’ it better.”). He’d learned that Dean called Sam and Bobby every week, talking to them from anywhere between five minutes and an hour. He’d learned that, despite all appearances, Dean didn’t like being alone, especially when he was at home.
Chuck had assured Castiel that they would begin the more intensive part of the therapy in the new year; Chuck insisted that Castiel had had a rough enough couple of months that he deserved a bit of a mental break, and focused instead on getting Castiel to talk to him and teaching Castiel different tactics to ease his anxiety. They were working quite well, and apparently, Castiel was responding positively to his new medication, which was cause for some kind of celebration.
“Here,” Castiel said, holding out the cup. “This should make you feel a little better and knock you out.”
“That was… a lot for you to process, wasn’t it?”
Dean had lifted his gaze to Castiel’s, his eyes tight with concern. “All right,” he said slowly, “I might need a bit more of an explanation than that.”
Dean abandoned the stove and briefly patted his pockets, sweeping his gaze around the kitchen before making eye contact with Castiel. For a long, tense moment, they just looked at each other. Then it was over as quickly as it had started, Dean’s gaze dropping to his feet “The party was really fun, Cas.”
Gabe quirked an eyebrow. “So I guess you know what they do to him.”
Castiel was gaping for the third time that night. “No, that’s—that’s Hael! She’s my assistant!”
Castiel cut himself another piece of pancake and wondered whether he preferred Iron Man over Captain America.
“I… all righ’.” Dean took the glass of water and quickly swallowed the pills, chugging the rest of the water down in one go and grimacing as he finished. “Bleh. My throat feels like it hit the bad end of a dragon.” He handed the glass back to Castiel.
Michael’s expression verged on a sneer. “I know.” His gaze returned to Castiel. “I was just passing through on a business trip for the company; I’m not exactly here for pleasure.” The sneer broke out in full force as he held up a blank manila file folder. “I have to speak with Castiel about his stocks in the family company. We’re rewriting policy and—”
“Aren’t we all?” Castiel shot over his shoulder as he ducked into his office, grabbing his copies of the Sutras and Analects. “Now, what did I do with the handouts?”
“The best kind. I may be sick, but that doesn’t mean I couldn’t take you in a fight. So are you gonna come up here, or am I gonna have to make you?”
Castiel laughed self-deprecatingly. “Um… When it gets packed. Kind of. Or, right before it really gets packed, when the top’s frozen over and it’s all crunchy, but if you crack the surface, it’s all soft and powdery underneath.” He shrugged, starting to blush. “The Inuit have dozens of different words for different kinds of snow. I’m much the same way, but only one type of snow is my favorite.”
Just as Castiel was about to drop off, he remembered the light on by the couch, the duvet he’d left to be unfolded and slept under.
The kids giggled and scattered some thank-yous in his direction before they hurried off his porch, eager to get to the next house.
“Yup.” Dean busied himself with untangling his earbuds. He preferred headphones if he couldn’t use a real stereo, but being on call meant having at least some of your focus on the real world.
“Yeah,” Castiel said, rubbing the sleep out of his eyes. “During college. They said it would take some serious therapy, introspection, and a lot less loneliness to get me out of the rut.” He smiled a self-deprecating smile. “I didn’t have the time for it. And I don’t need much sleep, anyway.”
Castiel tuned out the hustle and bustle of people finding their seats, refocusing when he heard and felt the rumble of the plane’s engines turning on. Dean went rigid as the flight attendants started demonstrating and narrating the different safety procedures, the knuckles on the hand that was clenching his iPod stark white as the plane turned towards the runway. Then, as the flight attendants buckled in and the plane started to gear up for takeoff, Dean’s jaw clenched tightly and his breathing picked up. Just as Castiel was about to say something calming, the plane’s engines kicked into high-gear and they were pressed into their seats as the plane roared down the runway; Dean sucked in a breath and before Castiel could ask him if he was all right, Dean grabbed him firmly by the arm. Too surprised to say anything, Castiel barely noticed as they lifted into the air. As the plane stabilized and flattened out, he felt rather than heard Dean’s slow exhale, and when Dean’s hand didn’t move from his arm, Castiel couldn’t hold back a smile.
Castiel paused, unsure of what to say. He finally decided on, “Of course. It’ll be sometime in the next three or four days.”
three times in a row would make designing his syllabus much easier. Said syllabus had consumed the other part of his day, and his living and dining rooms were covered in different religious texts, some of them yawning open and others perched on corners of tables and chairs. It had been a good enough distraction from the phone number burning through the top of his cast. But, when a knock had come at his door just at the edge of sundown, Castiel had had his question answered for him.
And the next thing Castiel knew he was on his back and Dean was pulling off Castiel’s boxers, mouthing a hot line of kisses down Castiel’s torso, paying special attention a spot whenever Castiel’s breathing hitched or he let out a stuttered moan. He nuzzled at Castiel’s happy trail before winking at Castiel, and then he ducked his head and swallowed Castiel’s cock down in one go, burying his nose in the nest of dark hair at the base.
“Dean, thank you for, you know, saving Bastet the way you did.” Castiel paused to take a breath and keep himself from saying everything he actually wanted to say. “If you hadn’t been here, I don’t know if she would’ve made it. So thank you.” Castiel steeled himself and glanced to his right.
Castiel stood up, alarmed, and grabbed Dean. “Dammit, I knew you were sick!”
“Yeah, I’m beginnin’ to get that.”
Castiel actually felt his jaw drop. “I — you — what?!”
Dean blinked, chewing on his bottom lip once. “Hey, Cas?”
Dean looked at him for a moment, something in his face guarded and vulnerable all at once. “Yeah. I’ve been imposin’ on you long enough.”
She shrugged. “Them’s the rules.”
“That’s good.” She scribbled something on his chart before going to check his levels. Her ID badge caught the light: her name was Sally. “You seem to be doing just fine. You should be discharged tomorrow afternoon, after you see a Physical Therapist.”
needed a shave, wondering how the hell he’d managed to skip the dream a second time. A moment later, he realized that a very warm calf was pressed against his, with another set of toes curled against his knee. Castiel set his jaw, cursed the fact that Dean somehow still looked perfect even when he was drooling all over Castiel’s spare pillow, and quickly disentangled himself from his best friend.
Castiel blushed a little. “Well, um, the dining table is—”
,” Castiel replied. “This one’s different, but David Duncan definitely plays off themes that Dostoevsky used.”
“Foot’s fine.” Castiel held up his right leg and rolled his ankle in midair to prove it. “I’m running every morning, and physical therapy’s going well. Dr. Bradbury and I are actually kind of friends. It’s nice.”
Dean gave Castiel a shit-eating grin and popped open the lid of one container. Steam burst out of a large pile of orange noodles garnished with a variety of lettuce, onions, and bean sprouts. Bastet licked her lips. Dean began shoveling the noodles onto one plate, creating an ample portion, before repeating the process with the other container.
“Morning,” Castiel returned with a slight smile; Gabe was so not a morning person, and Castiel found it highly amusing. “It’s a fresh pot.”
Castiel stared at her. “What.”
“Let’s have a little perspective here, Dean,” Castiel said, deadpan. “Flying in an airplane is easier than feeding five thousand people with only five loaves of bread and two fish.”
Castiel stared at him before saying, “No. Absolutely not. I can’t—”
“For everything,” Castiel said quietly. He smiled before turning, pressing his back to Dean’s front, snuggling into Dean’s embrace.
“How much?” Gabe asked, much to Castiel’s relief.
Castiel highly enjoyed an opportunity to catch up with his sister, who told him all about her current projects and even started sketching caricatures of all the nurses and doctors who passed by or stepped in to check Castiel’s levels or fluids or something (Castiel was usually too busy stifling his laughter to pay attention). By the time six o’clock rolled around, Dean was stepping into Castiel’s room all bright-eyed, bushy-tailed, and freshly-showered. Soon enough, he and Anna were getting along like a house on fire, volleying snark back and forth, and Castiel slowly came to the realization that this was his family. Once the thought hit him, he couldn’t stop smiling.
< Dean Winchester: how did that autocorrect even happen?
With a last wave, the vet retreated to her rooms, and Castiel stepped up to the desk. The assistant started explaining to him about fees as he filled out a clipboard stacked with forms about treatment and care and a lot of things he didn’t have the energy to think about. When he was finished, he capped his pen and handed the clipboard to Linda. “Is there any chance I could see Bastet before I leave?”
Dean: …
“I usually leave here at seven-thirty, give or take. That way, I get in a good two hours’ work before my ten-thirty class.”
Castiel frowned. “Oh, no, you don’t have to—”
Hael grinned as she sent off “okay great!” in response, wondering when the hell these two were going to get their act together.
“Oh.” Castiel clamped his mouth shut. “I’m… I’m not that important— you’re exaggerating—”
Dean let out a sigh and dragged his forearm across his forehead, wiping away the sweat as his wife beater rode up and exposed an indecent amount of abdomen. “We’re in the home stretch, Cas.” His grin was genuine but tired. “Give me another half-hour or so and she’ll be ready.”
Chuck began explaining a number of things to Castiel, starting off with the fact that he was holding off on a diagnosis for the time being before outlining what their time together would look like: they would most likely devoting their sessions to cognitive behavioral therapy. Castiel balked a little at the idea, but Chuck assured him of the program’s efficacy in helping patients face the sources of their fear and teach them how to work past said fear. Then, he moved into the broader realm of Castiel’s past, prompting Castiel with a few questions but mainly just listening to what he had to say and taking detailed (although illegible) notes. Already used to this routine, Castiel began telling his story in a dull sort of way before he relaxed a little, sincerely thinking about Chuck’s questions before answering them and feeling better after doing so. Before Castiel knew it, two hours had gone by, and Chuck was smiling and writing him a prescription for something called a ‘glucocorticoid.’ “See if you can get your brother to run down to the pharmacy for you,” Chuck said with one foot out the door, “and start taking them tomorrow, if you can. I think they’ll help.” He gave Castiel a nod. “I’ll see you again tomorrow. Same time. We’ll schedule your other appointments then.”
Dean sneezed.
Dean let out a long sigh and his breathing evened out as he fell into a deep sleep. Castiel lay awake for several minutes, desperately trying to calm down while reveling in their closeness, in how warm it was under the duvet compared to the chill of the air around them. He loved the way Dean felt pressed against him, unable to ignore the way their bodies fit together so seamlessly in this weird little maze of slumber. He lost himself in the sensation of the way Dean’s shins and knees pressed into his, the way it felt to have Dean breathing so close and so sincerely against his shoulder, and soon, he found himself falling asleep.
“Well, yeah, it’s definitely sad. The whole used-to-be-best-friends thing, and the way you guys kinda split apart. But the way neither of you talked about what happened, not to mention the ridiculous sexual tension between you two… it’s all just really dramatic.” She took a sip of her drink. “You should talk to him. I don’t think he knows why you dropped him, or why you two don’t talk anymore.”
“No,” Castiel, mumbled, his eyes beginning to close. “It’s good that I did.” The last thing he was aware of was being warm, and being held, and he thought that maybe this was better than being alone, this was better than an empty bed.
“No, it was something big, something important.” Gabe frowned and chewed his lip. “Could it be—?”
“Yeah, yeah, go for it.” Dean waved him away, already busy doing something with a wrench or whatever it was called and humming along to the Led Zeppelin playing in the background.
“Yes. Tell me, how did you become a nurse?”
“No worries,” Castiel replied, bringing his arms around in front of him to show Bobby what he was holding. “I was going to do the same thing.”
Dean smiled warmly, almost reverently. “So are you gonna… or are we sittin’ here all night?”
Castiel groaned into a couch cushion. “I think my brain has melted.”
to drown my sorrows. I’m not doing a very good job of it.”
Castiel exhaled slowly, trying not to think about the way Dean was kneeling next to him, gently rubbing Hydrogen Peroxide over the cuts along Castiel’s leg. The space between them seemed to hum, though with what Castiel was unsure. One thing he did know was that his interest in Dean wasn’t going anywhere, and that he was setting himself up for a long bout of unrequited pining.
“Castiel.” Michael gave him a grim little smirk, as poised and polished as ever, his suit tailored within an inch of its life. “How… lovely to see you.”
“Nuh-uh,” Dean said through bulging cheeks, “they don’t deserve shit this good.”
“One second,” Castiel replied, ducking into his bathroom and pulling out the one bottle of cold medicine that he owned. After peering at the label, he cracked open the lid and poured a little cupful.
Dean chuckled. “You would. C’mon, Professor. Let’s get you home.”
“Dean, what does it… look like?”
Castiel nodded. “I understand.”
no idea how this is getting so many hits, but thank you so much for reading!!! <3 and don't forget to drop me a lil' review :3
“No, no,” Castiel hurriedly assured her. “No, it’s just, I, um—” He cleared his throat. “It’s, uh, it’s… difficult,” he finally managed.
The nurse — Dean — fished around in the pants pocket of his scrubs and pulled out his ID badge. He clipped it to the pocket of his shirt. “I always forget to put on the damn thing. Sammy tells me I leave half my brain back at my house, and sometimes I believe him.” He smiled then, something soft and gentle, and Castiel experienced an odd moment of disappointment mingling with jealousy.
Dean’s frame visibly stiffened. “Cas—”
“Okay, Dean,” Castiel said around a laugh as Bastet leaned over his face to sniff his bandage, “I’ll keep the beard.” He nuzzled Bastet for another moment before she settled down in his lap, purring loudly. “How did you manage to get her in here?”
“Thank you, Doctor.”
Castiel’s responding laugh was so loud that the people in the next car shushed him.
“That, my fine friend, was a Vine.” Gabe scooted the bucket of homemade ice cream closer to himself and stuck the scooper into it. “Third one this evening, actually. We’re getting a lot of traffic.”
if you follow the gregorian calendar, happy new year! <3
After a few moments, Dean blinked awake and yawned, gazing blearily up at Castiel. Half his hair was sticking up, making him look younger, making Castiel’s heart skip a beat. “Cas?” he croaked.
WHOOP THERE IT IS
Gabe swore extensively, pushing his hair out of his eyes. “Castiel, you know what he does to you. Are you sure you can handle this?”
so.........
He hadn’t ventured far into Cleveland, mostly preoccupied with unpacking, designing his course on world religions, and being an introvert. But he had taken enough clearing-his-mind walks to know that there was a small park just a few streets away from his house, a park with both a swimming pool and a duck pond.
A minute later, Dean had returned with a small paper cup and a large glass of water to replace the one Castiel had finished with dinner. “Here.”
“Recurrin’ dream or recurrin’
“Upstairs,” Castiel supplied. “The first room.”
“This sucks,” Meg proclaimed some twenty minutes later, tossing her pencil onto the coffee table. She and Castiel were losing 9-21 to Dean and Garth. “I think it’s time for strip poker.”
Dean moaned at that and bucked his hips. Castiel acquiesced, pressing further forward and fucking into Dean, caging Dean with his limbs, pressing his lips to any available patch of skin. He slowed down when he felt the angle was right, wanting to pace it out, savor the feeling of Dean’s sweaty skin pressed against his. The slide became almost unbearable, tripping the line between pleasure and pain, but Dean was coming undone beneath him, murmuring a broken string of curses, sounds, and Castiel’s name. Castiel didn’t want to stop, loving the feeling of them together, the sound of their skin brushing together.
“I’m Dean. And I’ll be your nurse this evenin’.”
“I’ll say. How was your summer?”
Dean considered, putting down both of his mugs and reaching for his plate. “Definitely better’n last night, thanks to you.”
After sitting in silence for a few minutes, Dean muttered, “All right. That’s it. I’m done.” He stood up unsteadily and wandered over to the couch, sitting down with a groan.
, he thought, snuggling a little closer to Dean.
“But why would anyone want to watch a six second—?”
Castiel almost smiled. “All right.” He watched his brother flop down on the couch, pull Bastet into his lap, and switch on the TV, even though the game didn’t start for another hour. Somewhat befuddled, Castiel pulled out his phone and started a new text.
His mouth dry, Castiel stared down at the text from Dean, unsure of what to do. After a long moment, he swallowed painfully, deleting the text and turning off his phone, tucking it back into his briefcase and mentally readying himself for his first class.
“I…” Castiel tried lamely before grabbing the phone and closing the window. “It doesn’t matter.” He slid the phone back across the table to Dean.
Dean let out a short whistle and picked up his plate again. “Maybe it is a good thing you don’t sleep.”
“You bet. But the recipe’s huge, so I thought I oughtta share.” Dean sent him a smile that he definitely didn’t deserve.
“No—” Castiel groaned, forcing himself to scoot away from Dean before things got too close and… risky.
The Rambler’s gentle purr threw his memory back to the night he and Dean had christened the Rambler by parking in the drive-in, eating greasy but wonderful food, and chatting through most of Rear Window. Castiel snorted, pushing the image out of his mind, and pulled out into his driveway. He paused for a moment to press the little button on the remote that would close his garage door, taking a deep breath in another attempt to flush out the butterflies. Then, he inched out onto the road and turned in the direction of the highway, ignoring the sunny yellow house that gleamed at him from across the street.
. “Ow,” he mumbled into his floorboards, feeling distinct pain in at least two thirds of his body.
“No, it’s okay,” Castiel hurriedly assured him, intrigued to see that the part of the gauze that had met his skin was patched with dried blood and something… yellow? “Did I cut myself?” He hadn’t noticed before.
Meg raised a dark, stupidly perfect eyebrow and took a sip of her beer. “That’s definitely not a firetruck, Clarence.”
“I’m gonna find you a new car!”
“Yes. Although I’d only be able to see your house, so you’d have to be the murderer.”
Castiel nodded, crumbling another hunk of bread and scattering it into the water. “They’re the only ones who like my stale bread.”
“Do you have supplies?” Castiel asked, his heart pounding. He had no idea what kind of footing they were on now, if they would’ve kissed or just written it off as a huge mistake—
Castiel stared fixedly at the pattern on his blanket, forcing himself to count to ten before he looked up, meeting Dean’s gaze for the first time.
She nodded. “Of course. Just go through those doors—” she gestured to the double doors on her right “—and the care center is the first room on your left.”
“Do what?”
“I came prepared,” he assured Castiel with a wink. Castiel hastily excused himself and went to the kitchen, pouring a bowl of the chips and mentally discouraging a certain part of his anatomy, because
Castiel sent one last glance in Dean’s direction (Dean appeared to be suddenly very interested in the cards in his hand) before gritting his teeth and thinking,
Castiel licked his lips. “If, uh, there happens to be a cheeseburger, then, um—”
“No promises, Cas.”
Castiel grinned to himself as she kept on talking.
Castiel nervously shifted from foot to foot; he really had to pee. The line for the bathroom was a good fifteen people long, and he was third in line.
Temporarily rendered speechless, Dean could only stare at Castiel, his mouth hanging open a little. “I, okay.” He cleared his throat in one quick cough. “Yeah, um, that sounds great.”
“Got any eights?”
Dean hummed. “I see your point. And I guess the panic attacks aren’t good, either.”
“Stop exaggeratin’,” Dean coughed, giving Sam a none-too-gentle shove in the direction of the exit, not that it affected Sam much. “We should get goin’. Bobby’ll be mad if we’re not back in time for lunch.”
Castiel blinked before last night suddenly hit him. “Oh.”
“So you need to talk to him. I don’t mean now, and definitely not until this whole Michael thing has blown over, but maybe after that. Cas needs a stable and supportive friend right now more than he needs anything else, and his mental health should be your top concern, above everything else, even the concern of your crotch-snake.”
Castiel nodded but was prevented from replying by Dean, who decided to announce his arrival by falling down the last five stairs on the staircase. Alarmed, Castiel rushed out into the hallway just in time to see Dean straighten up with a grin and call, “Beat ya, Sammy!” and hear Sam scoff from the upstairs landing and say, “It doesn’t count if you throw yourself down the stairs,
Accordingly, when the end of Castiel’s class approached, Hael carefully shut Bastet in and headed for the cafeteria, putting together a tray that she thought covered all the bases: garden salad with vinaigrette, some pasta marinara, a small French roll, and a fresh apple. She took it back to his office, ready to ambush him when he reappeared, guessing that if Dean’s intuition was anything to go off, Castiel wouldn’t be heading to lunch.
Castiel’s eyes widened, but Dean kept going:
ahhhhh sorry for the late update :( school's been INSANE! but i hope you like it :3
“I’m bi,” Dean said like he was explaining something to a petulant three year-old. “And I was a very closeted teenager. Cas, I’ve had a crush on you since the moment I met you.” He gave a one-shouldered shrug. “Details.”
Gabe waited until he heard Castiel’s bedroom door close before he made eye contact with Dean and jerked his head in the direction of the kitchen. Dean nodded and followed.
Seething and almost sweating through his button-down, he gave one last tug and the sock finally cooperated. “Thank you Zeus and all your pretty bastards!” He lunged for his bed, grabbing his suit jacket and the pair of semi-fancy shoes he’d somehow remembered to dust off the night before. Bastet meowed and ran after him, almost getting tangled in his feet as he charged downstairs.
“Oh yeah? What’s his name?”
He grimaced slightly and stepped out into the hallway.
She didn’t receive a reply until just over an hour later, when she was at home surfing the Internet for a decent ottoman.
Dean made an odd strangled noise, somewhere between a groan and a laugh.
“I can’t believe you got hit by a car,” he murmured, brushing a kiss by her ear, his hand shaking. “Was this just a ploy to get Dean back into our lives? And yes, you’re completely capable of that. Don’t think I haven’t heard the way you’ve been complaining over the last month.” Castiel stroked a careful fingertip along her fuzzy cheek. “You have to promise me that you’re gonna rest up, and get better. The house is going to be too quiet without you.” Castiel bestowed one final kiss on her head and pulled something out of his pocket — Bastet’s favorite blanket, worn down by countless naps and years of kneading. He tucked the blanket next to her. “I don’t know yet whether I should thank you or make you wear the cone of shame for the next week.” He smiled. “I’ll let you know when I figure it out.”
After changing out of his pajamas and into the baggiest sweatpants and t-shirt he owned, he plodded quietly downstairs, not really knowing how to act around Dean. He wasn’t sure if they were acknowledging the whole nightmare-comfort-talk-cuddling thing, and his heart pounded as he entered the dining room, less than ten feet away from the kitchen.
“Yeah, last week.”
Gabriel was smirking, one eyebrow lifted as he ran a hand down Bastet’s back. “So, Cassie. We have a lot of catching up to do.”
“No,” Castiel mumbled, squeezing the corner of his pillow to prevent himself from rolling over and pulling Dean closer to him.
Castiel snorted, a grin spreading across his face. “What, just because I’m a stuck-up religion professor I’m not allowed to have a life?”
Dean nodded. “Yeah. I can get you there.” He ran a hesitant finger along the top of Bastet’s head and she let out a little mew in response. “Why did you do the thing with the towels?”
,” he read aloud, somewhat unsure. “Isn’t this the book by that Russian guy—?”
Dean chuckled quietly. The room was so still for a moment that Castiel thought he was alone. The darkness made the room more soothing, making it easier for him to forget where he was, and the last thing he thought he could feel was a rough, warm hand brushing gently against his own.
Dean gulped, but his voice was steady. “Took me longer to wake you this time. You were, uh… screamin’ for somebody.”
Castiel finally managed to make it into the bathroom, and he bent over a urinal in relief. The events of the last three weeks swam hazily in his mind, everything from the morning after Thanksgiving to the last day of classes….
“Ohhhh.” Garth nodded in understanding, but didn’t drop his sly look. “Friend, huh?”
thanks for reading :3 new chapter asap!
Michael gave him this look that had Castiel gulping and taking another step back. “Los Angeles was my next port of call and I was going to speak with Anna on my way home, not that it matters.” He returned his attention to Castiel. “So. Can we talk?”
A few minutes later, they were waiting for the elevator, Castiel clutching his new crutches and his stomach fluttering at the idea of Dean potentially waiting out there on the curb for him.
Hael gently rubbed his arm. “But it’ll be a good thing for you to do. Healthy, even.” She hopped off her stool, surprisingly chipper. “Now. I’m going to drive you home and make you drink a very large glass of water before you really regret this little bar visit.”
Left in the dark with only his muted heart monitor for company, Castiel stared at the ceiling, trying to believe he was somewhere else. He’d never liked hospitals, mostly because he hated being taken care of. He wasn’t too fond of the smell, either.
and Castiel’s eyes flew open.
Hael scoffed. “Boundaries-shmoundaries. I’m your friend, too, Castiel. And quite honestly, I’m worried about what you might do to that beer if you
“I… are you sure?”
Gabe popped open the can, grabbed a spoon, and started to fill one of Bastet’s food dishes. “He forgot to give Bastet her dinner, for starters.”
Castiel huffed and handed over his six. Dean cackled happily and added the pair to his pile.
Castiel nodded as the door to the garage pulled up. “She stays in my office. Hael watches her while I’m in class.” He shrugged and opened the car, carefully sliding Bastet into the backseat. “It’s easier that way.”
“Oh, yeah? Whose?”
Castiel tried his best to ignore the way that sounded. “Hmm?”
, Castiel thought reluctantly.
, he thought dizzily on his way to school) or if he’d remembered to change his shirt.
, Castiel was constantly and bitterly reminding himself,
“Don’t worry, you’re still a special little snowflake.” Castiel was kneeling now, gently lifting Bastet out of her carrier and into the little area they had set up for her by Hael’s desk, complete with food bowls and a small covered litter box. “Hael: she’s already eaten this morning, but she slept for most of the car ride so she might wander around a bit. Just keep an eye on her and make sure she doesn’t try to jump on anything.”
It was silent at first, but then came the bright chime of flutes, soon joined by violins and instruments that Dean couldn’t name, but the music filled him, cheerful and light and beautiful, and, addicted to the sounds, he knew that he was going to have trouble giving this CD back.
. “How long will she stay here for?”
“Well of course,” Castiel replied, turning to his closet. “She loves to snuggle, and it was warmer under there than it was in the rest of the house.” He opened his closet and pulled out a thick flannel shirt before going over to his chest of drawers to retrieve a pair of corduroys, a wool sweater, and a huge pair of socks.
gah! i can't believe it's over!! (and i'm such a fluffy piece of trash i know i know)
Garth, who had lost both his socks and his button-down (but not his t-shirt), was still grinning with utter benevolence. Castiel, on the other hand, was sending a prayer to every god he could think of, begging them to let him keep his shirt and pants.
She grinned as she headed for the phone sitting on his desk. “I had a wonderful summer. I spent most of it exploring Barcelona with some friends.”
Castiel reached into his satchel for his house keys, and a moment later, they were standing in his front entryway. He gestured towards the back of the house. “The kitchen’s in that direction.”
“Don’t panic,” Dean said through gritted teeth as they paused at the top of the staircase; from what they could tell, Sam and Bobby were already awake and downstairs, presumably waiting for them. A thin chorus of Christmas carols floated upwards from the living room. “They’re… they’ll just…”
Castiel shook his head. “No, thanks. I think I’ll just doze for a bit. See if I have any epiphanies.”
They were quiet after that, and Castiel slowly felt himself drifting further and further towards the edge of sleep,
“Dude,” Dean drawled, licking some stay sour cream off his fingers (Castiel felt his insides turn to warm goop). “This is one of the best burritos I’ve ever had.”
The flight attendants greeted them with wide smiles and told them that they could sit anywhere they liked. Since they had checked in so early, they were among the first people on the plane. Castiel could see Dean visibly cringing as they walked down the narrow aisle between the seats.
“I hate flyin’.” Dean popped open the hood and leaned over the engine, running his fingers over the clean machinery. “Only been on a plane maybe once or twice in my life.”
“A panic attack?” Dean repeated. “Why—?”
Dean watched him for a good long moment, the room silent. In the background, Tony was in the middle of telling Dr. Banner that he needed to strut.
“No, ‘m not!” Dean still blearily insisted, his eyes half-closed and unfocused. “‘m fine!”
. He handed over his two of spades, causing Dean to smile just a little, and resolved to leave the matter alone.
Castiel huffed and followed, a bit slower on his crutches. “What’s in the bag, Dean?”
Dean coughed a little, blushing as Castiel sat down next to him. “
“I, uh. The opportunity never arose.”
Castiel blinked. “When did you leave? I don’t remember you leaving.”
Now it was Castiel’s turn to stare. “What?”
Dean glanced at his watch again, his forehead puckering as his mouth did something between a frown and a grimace. “Where d’you live?” he asked Castiel, his voice gruff.
Since it was his first day, Castiel wasn’t expecting anyone to actually show up for his office hours. But, at 1:05, a hesitant hand tapped on his inner door, and he looked up from the working draft of his book in surprise.
Castiel, Sam, and Dean spent the next few hours wandering the nearby woods, bantering and joking and complaining about the wind until the impending loss of sunlight made them realize they had better pick out a tree. The woods were riddled with Douglas Firs (“Don’t ask,” Sam had warned Castiel. “We have no idea how these ended up growing here.”), and they made their decision just as the sun started threatening to go down. The tree was just over six feet tall and full-bodied, giving off the best Christmas-tree smell Castiel had ever experienced. Sam made quick work of the trunk in four swings of the ax, leaving Dean and Castiel to saw the end flat. When they hoisted the tree over their shoulders like pallbearers, Castiel was surprised to find that it was lighter than he’d thought it would be.
Dean nodded in approval, still smiling a little. His medium-length beard made his general face and neck area more attractive than usual, and for a moment Castiel was gripped by a severe urge to find out what it felt like against his mouth. “Dr. Bradbury’s great,” Dean replied. “She really knows her stuff. You’re in good hands.” He looked at Castiel again, his eyes a tad more calculating than before. “But, y’know, how’re you?”
“Yeah,” Dean replied. “I’ve got some canned stuff, blankets and firewood and all that.” He flashed Castiel some sort of half-smile. “I’m not as prepared as you, but I ain’t exactly useless.”
“C’mon, Castiel.” Jo used her foot to engage the wheelchair’s brake. “Time to go.”
“Huh.” Castiel could hear Dean’s smile turn into a grin. “Well aren’t we a pair of idiots?”
is my favorite.”
“I can’t believe you were going to potentially drive through ice just to avoid getting on a plane,” Castiel deadpanned. “Relax. You’ll be fine.”
That night, he didn’t manage to make it to the bathroom before he threw up, from the dizziness and pounding headache more than anything else. He hugged the trash can he’d put next to his bed as a precaution and it took almost ten minutes for the room to stop spinning, after which he cried a little with relief, Bastet nuzzling next to him and licking the tears from his face. Even after he woke up, he could feel the ghost of his ribs breaking, his jaw cracking, the bleached-urine smell of the local hospital that patched him up after every one of Michael’s episodes hanging in his nostrils.
A few very painful minutes later, the vet reappeared, her expression clear of the strain that had shown when Dean handed over Bastet’s limp form. “Mr. Novak?”
Gabe held up a hand to silence him. “I’ll explain later. Just don’t you dare leave. Castiel will need you after this is over.” And he disappeared, running up the stairs behind his brother.
“Castiel, if you wouldn’t mind.”
“We’re going to keep her until she’s stable. Maybe two or three days.”
“I know exactly what you mean.” Castiel gave Dean another smile before returning to the essay he was reading. His students had definitely improved in their research and analytical skills since the beginning of the year, and their essays were becoming more and more enjoyable to read.
> Dean: yea just a patient medical
Castiel avoided Dean’s gaze. “I don’t know what you mean.”
Raj’s gaze quickly darted to Dean, who was in the process of stepping aside and throwing his trash away. “Who’s—?”
Castiel set up a sort of sleeping space on the floor by the couch, determinedly refuting all of Dean’s protests that they could share the couch.
“You’ve got a magic touch, Cas,” Dean replied after swallowing his mouthful. “And you can’t let beauty like this go to waste.”
“I doubt I have a say in the matter,” Castiel replied drily.
“Everybody say ‘Apple pieeeee!’” Gabe bent over said pie with a grin, phone in hand.
> Dean: wut r ur plans 4 hallowe en
Around six o’clock, Gabe yelled at them from the kitchen to “SIT YOUR ASSES DOWN, YOU LUCKY MUTHAFUCKAHS!” and they hastily scrambled to obey, applauding when Gabe came striding out of the kitchen grinning widely and bearing a truly gorgeous turkey. Then Gabe dragged Anna back with him to help bring in the side dishes, and Dean laughed as he poured them all a glass of apple cider.
He squinted at the wheelchair. “But I have crutches.”
Castiel glared at the TV, which was showing the opening credits of a
Hael checked her watch. “Just over twelve minutes.”
“Regardless, I should have warned you.” Castiel sank into his pillows. “I often have issues sleeping, and it seems that the car accident only exacerbated the problem.”
The lights in his room went out and he was vaguely aware of Dean murmuring, “Just call me if you need anythin’, all right? The button’s right there.”
Castiel chuckled. “Yes. You can come downstairs.”
Castiel nodded once. He could practically feel the gap opening between them. “I’m glad.”
“I…” Castiel was at a loss for words, and he turned back to his apples with a blush.
Dean pushed Castiel back against the closed door, fisting his hand in Castiel’s shirt, pulling Castiel’s mouth against his own. Castiel whimpered, trying to pull Dean further over him, into him; both of them shucked their coats, scarves, hats. Castiel untucked Dean’s button-down from his pants, running his hands across the broad expanse of warm, soft skin that was Dean’s back; Dean groaned hot and heavy into Castiel’s mouth, his grip tightening on Castiel’s hips.
Dean blinked. “What’s that?”
, Castiel almost said, very loudly and pointedly. “Nope. And you know the tea made you feel better. And that the hoodie is ridiculously soft.”
“I’m sorry that you had to find out this way. I wasn’t going to tell you at all, but—”
Dean chewed a piece of bacon thoughtfully before voicing his next question: “So how long will I have to, y’know, overstay my welcome?”
“We had a bet.” Sam tucked the bill into his pocket, looking smug and triumphant. “I bet that you guys would get your shit together by Christmas. Bobby said it would be New Year’s.”
Hael grinned at his reaction. “They actually had to cap it, and there’s a waiting list. What can I say, Prof?” She snatched a copy of his syllabus out of his hands and headed for the door, presumably on her way to the copier. “Your reputation precedes you.”
Dean snorted and tightened his grip on Castiel’s hand. “All right.” He rolled his shoulders and cleared his throat, giving Castiel a quick peck on the mouth before he started walking downstairs, keeping a firm hold of Castiel’s hand.
Dean hastily shoved another handful of popcorn into his mouth in an effort to avoid looking at Cas for the six-hundredth time that day. Gabe mimicked him, his cheeks bulging like a chipmunk’s.
Dr. Barnes paused in her note-taking and watched him carefully. “Why?”
“The night shift,” Castiel replied as he slowly walked past her and into the short hallway. Using his foot again felt very strange. “He was on duty the night of my accident. And then we figured out that we’re actually neighbors.”
“Well yeah, I raised him. And I’m the awesomest dude around.” Dean replaced Castiel’s chart and eyed Castiel’s tray. “What, you’re not gonna eat the pudding?”
, and he was all tousled and unshaven and so goddamn—I have no idea how I didn’t jump his bones every—”
Castiel gave him a small smile. “That would be very nice, Dean. Thank you.”
“I thought so, yes. If you want.” Dean watched Castiel, somehow still insecure.
“Gotcha. Back row, left corner. That’s me.” He gave Castiel a wink before turning and heading to the seats.
“Hot dayyuummm,” Kevin drawled. “You fine.”
Dean looked as though he’d been slapped across the face, staring at Castiel with such an expression of disbelief and hurt that Castiel almost regretted it, almost regretted cutting Dean out of his life. But then he remembered that fateful Sunday morning. The shame still pooled thick in his gut.
“Well, I—” Castiel quickly put down the sandwich and brushed the crumbs off his hands, reaching out for her and receiving a warm hug. “All the better, now that you’re here!”
“No, I mean like really celebrate. You gettin’ the all-clear, school startin’ up next week… Summer needs to end with a bang.” Castiel hastily shoved an extra-large spoonful of ice cream into his mouth as Dean pulled out his phone. “I’ve got tomorrow off. I’ll rustle up some of the crew and we’ll play Pictionary and strip poker at yours.” He dialed a number and smirked at Castiel. “You’re buyin’ the alcohol.”
1: "the brothers k" is a fantastic book in my opinion, strongly recommend. and "winnie" is irwin's nickname, if that wasn't clear.
“Dean Winchester.”
Castiel took a step back, alarmed. “Okay, we can watch the game. Sorry.”
. He didn’t understand what line they were dancing on, if Dean might’ve liked him back (which he probably didn’t) or, if he
The transition from spending all of his free time with Dean to not spending any time with him at all was eased by the amount of work Castiel had to do, and by Hael’s insistence that she show him more of Cleveland. But, it wasn’t as if Castiel hadn’t seen Dean at all. On the weekends, he’d see Dean roll out his old-fashioned lawn mower and trundle around the small patches of grass on the front and sides of his house, unhelpfully shirtless. If Castiel came home late, he’d sometimes see the lights on in Dean’s house, sometimes even the blue flicker and muted sound of a television. And, he’d hear the Impala’s signature rumble and Led Zeppelin’s signature drums at least twice a week, either late at night when insomnia and the nightmare had him in their grip, or in the afternoon, when Dean would slump in the driver’s seat and slowly drag himself up his front walk. But, every appearance was marked by the memory of Dean’s phone conversation, the words rattling around in Castiel’s mind, and Castiel would turn away from the window, feeling a muted burn of pain.
“Nope,” Castiel affirmed, already used to the drill of changing his dressing. “How was the night shift?”
Gabe let out a whoop, punching the air. “YES!” He spun on his heel. “And we can totally go to that drive-in tonight, just like you wanted to.”
The cup empty, Castiel released the straw and let out his own sigh, feeling much more awake. “Sorry.”
Medial malleolar fractures often occur with a fracture of the fibula (lateral malleolus), a fracture of the back of the tibia (posterior malleolus), or with an injury to the ankle ligaments.
Gabe grinned as he filmed them.
“You should finish it.” Castiel tried to take a steadying breath. “You’re so close to the end, and I think that you’ll really really really like the end.”
Dean snorted weakly, sounding as sleepy as Castiel felt. “Of course I’m sure. So. You in?”
Castiel spent the rest of Wednesday taking Anna on a tour of the city (Gabe obligingly drove), frowning for Gabe’s Instagrams (“They’re eating this shit up,” Gabe had chuckled as he snapped a photo of Castiel squinting into the camera), offering Anna feedback on her current project (“I’ve done three fantasy novels in a row now,” she said, shaking her head. “What I wouldn’t give for a good crime novel.”), and not-so-casually waiting for the time when Dean would stop by on his way to the hospital. On Wednesday, he caught the Novaks beginning a game of whist.
Castiel turned to look at him with a ghost of his smile. “That’s reserved for sick days and injuries.”
> Dean: gi mme 2 m   ins
Castiel snorted. “And you say I’m the dramatic one.”
“Thanks, Jo,” Dean said, completely ignoring Castiel. He stepped closer, and Castiel noticed with a vague burn of annoyed resignation that when it came to Dean, jeans and a t-shirt were just as flattering as scrubs. “How’re things up there?”
“Sorry,” Castiel mumbled, trying to keep calm.
“Oh.” Dean relaxed again, his mouth curling into a small, pleased smile. “That’s… that’s nice.” His grip tightened on Castiel’s hand and his thumb stroked the edge of Castiel’s palm.
Amy was their surrogate, and she was carrying a little baby girl who Dean and Castiel had been waiting to see for nine months, maybe even longer.
Castiel loved Halloween. He loved its roots, the costumes, the decorations, the traditions, the candy… He especially loved the candy.
“You look good, kid.” Bobby clapped Dean on the shoulder and Dean gave him the glare of a disgruntled teenager. “Who’s been feedin’ you?”
“Yeah, sure. Next thing you’ll be tellin’ me that you’ve harbored a secret crush for Clint Barton since you were twelve.”
(See the end of the chapter for
“Oh, my God, I’m so sorry,” Castiel started to babble, dropping his hands from where they’d somehow become latched onto Dean’s coat. “I don’t know why I did that, I know I just messed everything up—” Dean was as still as a statue, staring at Castiel with huge eyes, his smile gone. “I just fucked up our entire friendship, didn’t I? Oh, great, just great.” Castiel turned on the spot, whirling completely around, lost and hurt and having no idea of how he was going to salvage any remnant of their friendship. “I’m so sorry, can we just forget that ever happened? I promise I’ll—”
“Oh.” Dean performed an odd shuffling movement, and a moment later, a corner of the duvet fell away to reveal that he was holding Bastet snugly against his chest. “She’s fine.”
“That’s because she’s not always fond of meeting new people.” Castiel observed the way Bastet was winding around Dean’s legs and purring loudly. “But she appears to like you.”
“She went into labor?!”
“Ah. Yeah. Hael.” Dean flexed his jaw in a movement that he probably thought Castiel wouldn’t notice, but Castiel was far too good at reading Dean by this point, and Castiel smirked as he led the way to his office. For whatever reason, Dean was jealous of Hael, or at least threatened by her, and Castiel couldn’t fathom it. He did, however, find it highly amusing (and, if he had to admit it, really adorable).
“All right, Gabe, what was that for?” Dean asked as Castiel got to work carving up the pie.
“It’s Sunday night.” Gabe squeezed his shoulder again. “You were asleep for two days.”
Dean’s hand appeared out of nowhere, diving into the bag of bread and tearing off a piece.
“No,” she replied, the corner of her mouth twitching. “I meant, what are you doing here
Gabe strode into the picture, his frame rippling with fury as he stepped between Castiel and their eldest brother. “What the hell are you doing here, Michael?” he demanded, his voice barely below a shout.
Dean blinked at him. “You’re writin’ a book?”
Dean stiffened, almost imperceptibly, before thumbing through his cards. “Got any twos?” he asked, his voice losing its joking air. He didn’t make eye contact with Castiel.
Dean collapsed onto his secondhand sofa, pressing a hand to his eyes. “What’m I gonna do, Sammy?” he groused, as if they hadn’t had this conversation at least ten times before.
“Then maybe this is a good place to start,” Castiel replied.
“I— nothin’, nothin’.” Dean dropped his gaze and stepped onto the porch, letting Castiel reach behind him to lock the door.
But Dean kept a firm grip on it. “Oh, yes!” He flipped to a new page and broke into another burst of laughter. “Is—are you serving tea?! In a little tux?!”
Castiel gasped awake, his limbs taut and ready to snap. “I—what’s—what’s happening?”
from Gabe’s text.
Michael was standing by the window in Castiel’s office looking out over the backyard, the light highlighting his slick hair and sharp features.
Dean stared at him for a long moment, dumbfounded. “That’s it,” he finally said, standing up and heading for the front hallway.
Castiel swept his sixth-to-last French fry through some ketchup and considered whether or not he was imagining the growing ache in his ribs.
“Not bad,” Gabe chimed in around a smirk. “Not bad at all.”
Castiel followed Dean into the elevator and stared at his shoes for the duration of the ride up to the twelfth floor: the elevator was lined with mirrors, and he wasn’t sure if he could handle catching the way he looked at Dean.
“And half of Wall Street would applaud you.”
. We have to watch it. Or I may die.”
Castiel cocked his head to one side. “But I’m not raising a child.”
They ate a breakfast of bread and preserves from a nearby farm, Dean promising to cook them a huge breakfast for Christmas morning. “Pancakes and eggs and bacon as far as the eye can see,” he told them with a familiar excited gleam in his eye.
“I—I’m not lying.”
He reached for the collar of his shirt and pulled it off in one swift movement.
Gabe pulled out his phone using his good hand and started tapping away. “Listen, as much as I’d like to, I can’t stay for any longer, not that Cas would even let me. So I’m going to have to rely on you to keep an eye on him, if you’d be willing—”
Dean made a bitchface reminiscent of Sam. “C’mon, dude,
“I’ll say,” Castiel mumbled, still not quite sure how to process this.
Dean let out a little chuckle. “Thanks.” He stepped back into his house, widening the gap between them. “I’ll finish it soon, let you know what I think.”
“Shhh,” was Dean’s clever reply, attention already back on the TV.
Bobby waved a hand at him and stood up, rubbing his stomach. “I’m gettin’ too old for this.” He made for the doorway. “‘Sides, I know you two’ll wake me up at some ridiculous hour tomorrow.”
“HEYYYY LIL’ BRO!” Gabe bounded into the room, looking entirely too energetic to be allowed in a hospital wing. He was at Castiel’s other side in an instant, and Dean barely had time to get the cup of water out of the way before Gabe hugged Castiel, squeezing him tightly.
“So how do these office hours work?” Dean asked around another mouthful, the habit disgusting but somehow completely endearing.
“Hey, Cas.” Dean tried to smile, but he wavered where he stood, his eyes watering a little and his skin flushed. He was shivering. “Ready to find out who won?”
Castiel fiddled with his napkin. “So?”
Dean’s expression shifted into a more endearing look, and Castiel noticed their remarkable proximity. “I heard you, Doc. Cas,” he corrected quickly. “You were, um, callin’ out and thrashin’ all over your bed, and—”
“Theology geek, remember?”
“Dean.”
“Bullshit.” Gabe crowded into Michael’s space, forcing the taller man to take a grudging step back. “You know the rules. Call before you come into town, only speak to Cas in front of another family member—”
When they were all settled with their ice cream-covered slices steaming and melting in front of them (Gabe had thought to warm up the pie, bless him), Castiel looked up in surprise when the others all let out simultaneous groans as they chewed their first bites. “Is it good?” he asked them, fork hovering over his own slice.
“Thank you, Professor Novak,” three of his students (Mike, Raj, and Bella) chimed as they filed out of the room. “Have a good weekend!”
There was a beat of silence, then: “What’s goin’ on, Cas? I mean…” Dean appeared to struggle for the words. “I haven’t talked to you in over a month, and you’re bein’ all… Did I do something wrong? Are you mad at me?”
“Yeah.” Dean shook his head and replaced the phones. “They didn’t want to drunk dial.” He nudged the doorway despondently with the edge of his foot.
Dean shook his head vigorously.
RN Sally smiled again. “Sounds great.” She left the remote by his right hand. “See you in ten.” RN Sally left  his room.
“Afraid not,” Castiel mumbled, his stomach lurching as he caught another whiff of finely-spiced tomato sauce and succulent meat.
Images of broken glass, dented metal, leaking brake fluid, and flashing red lights swirled through Castiel’s mind. “Yes,” he agreed. “Better.”
“Oh, please,” Dean mumbled, not four inches away from Castiel’s ear. “Your bump is almost gone.” He turned to Castiel with a soft smile. “I see you milkin’ it for all its worth.”
They ate by the fireplace, Dean very pleased with his soup and Castiel studiously ignoring the way the firelight played across Dean’s cheekbones (it highlighted his freckles). Dean laughed when Castiel made stupid jokes and he teased Bastet about the way she snuffled into her Fancy Feast and it was all so domestic and perfect that Castiel almost felt himself choking on it all. He grimly reminded himself that they were going to be stuck in here for at least another two days, so he really had to keep himself in check and not do something stupid like confess his not-so-platonic feelings for Dean or pin Dean to the couch and perform a very thorough exploration of the inside of Dean’s mouth.
Gabe shook his head. “All right. Whatever you say.” He waited for Castiel to head for the stairs, and when Castiel was out of earshot, he ducked close to Dean and hissed, “Don’t. Leave.”
“Holy shit.” Castiel gulped. “I can’t—”
“Don’t tell anyone,” Dean mumbled into Castiel’s shirt. “Just. I
“It’s kinda…” Dean thought for a moment as he gently pressed the gauze to Castiel’s skin and reached behind himself to grab a piece of medical tape. “It’s like a bull’s-eye, y’know? Ring of greenish-yellow around the edge—” one piece of tape sealed the gauze to Castiel’s skin “—ring of magenta after that—” a second and third piece slid on next “—and in the middle it’s all purple and blue around the scrape.” Dean smoothed on the last piece of tape with care, giving Castiel another smile before he backed away and started gathering up his trash. “Like I said. Alien eye.”
Dean raised an eyebrow. “You didn’t eat lunch, did you?”
Dean shook his head and went back to the sink, refilling one of the cups and bringing it back to Castiel, sliding the straw into his mouth. Castiel drank, starting to feel a little overwhelmed, when suddenly—
“You’re talking to a guy whose teenage years consisted of exploring Confucianism and collecting comics.” Castiel shook his head. “Besides, it was pretty conservative where I lived. I couldn’t
“No, I was in the kitchen.” Castiel tried to slow his breathing in order to calm himself. “I need to get her to the vet.”
“All right,” Gabe agreed warily. “But I’m calling Anna. She’ll want to talk to you.”
Castiel snorted and picked up the mini box of Lucky Charms. He struggled with opening the bag, but once he had his first mouthful of marshmallows, he decided that maybe being stuck in this hospital wasn’t such a bad thing after all.
“Y’sure?” came his driver again, starting to sound worried.
Dean turned to look at Castiel, his grin small and endearing. “You
ahhh sorry for the delay!!! but here's the chapter you've all been waiting for ;)
“Goodnight,” Dean said loudly from somewhere behind Castiel.
Dean let out a little huff and his smile widened. “No. I don’t do that to my friends.”
Castiel sighed. “Dean, I’m new to this city. I don’t even know my neighbors.” He shook his head. “There’s no one for me to call.”
“Wanna watch some TV instead? Might be easier than tryin’ to sleep.” Castiel suddenly realized that Dean was being kind.
“No,” Dean cut in. “No, it isn’t.”
“Just forget it,” he muttered, burying the heel of his palm into his eyes before backing away from the wall and digging out a lone deck of cards from somewhere on his desk. “It doesn’t matter to him, so why should it matter to you?”
Castiel shook his head. “It was totaled. My poor car is now in car Heaven.”
Dean made the noise of a blocked foghorn as Bastet stepped fully into his lap, staring up at him and leaning in to give his chin a good sniff. Apparently satisfied, she turned on the spot and settled down, tucking her paws underneath the front of her body and purring louder than before.
“Jesus Christ on a candlestick.” Dean made a face and flipped his eight at Castiel, who caught it with a triumphant smirk. “That’s it,” Dean declared, putting down his pile of cards. “You win. Me: one, Castiel: eight. You won eight damn games of Go Fish. Proud of yourself?”
Castiel stared back at him, shocked. “But… but…”
When he stumbled into his office about ten minutes before his class started, Bastet in her carrier, Hael actually stood up at her desk with a genuine look of worry. “Castiel—”
The nurse cracked a grin and reached up to scratch at the three-day stubble lining his jaw. A very angular, lovely jaw, Castiel noted. “Well, that’s your name, innit? Dr. Castiel Novak,” he read aloud off the chart, “Professor of Theology at Oberlin College.”
Dean blinked, but Castiel couldn’t tell if it was in surprise or not. “Have you talked to someone about this? A doctor? A shrink? Anybody?”
Castiel gently put Bastet down on the bed, watching as she immediately gravitated to Dean and tucked herself half-under the duvet, half-under his arm; Dean frowned and adjusted to let her in. “Dean?” he whispered. “Do you need anything else?”
Castiel managed to collect himself enough to get through the back door and into his kitchen without tripping over something. He sagged against the counter and thunked his head on the cabinet. “Idiot. Idiot. Idiot.” A plaintive meow sounded at his feet. “I know, I know.” The other day, it had taken Castiel all of five minutes to come to terms with the fact that his interest in Dean was far past the realm of a hookup and verging into the territory of ‘if you weren’t in my life I don’t know what I’d do.’ And that had only made things more difficult, especially because Dean was very obviously straight and very obviously not into Castiel.
“Really?” Dean leaned against the counter; Bastet perked up from where she was sleeping next to the sink and let out a little chirp. “How can you tell?”
Castiel started to laugh, but had to stop when a piece of green onion almost got caught in his airway. He fell into a coughing fit and gladly accepted the can of Coke Dean handed him. They were sitting cross-legged on opposite ends of Castiel’s couch, facing each other with Bastet in the middle and a myriad of Chinese food on the coffee table. Old Looney Tunes reruns were playing on the TV, but the sound was low enough for them to talk to each other. Castiel discovered how much there was for them to catch up on, and how glad he was that Dean had insisted on buying him dinner to partially make up for what had happened.
“Hmmph.” Dean twisted to kiss Castiel’s hand, the corner of his mouth sliding into a smile. “Number one. Definitely.” He leaned up and forward, his mouth barely grazing Castiel’s before kissing him earnestly, slow and languid.
Dean’s response was a sneeze.
“Nah,” she replied, a smile dancing in the corners of her mouth. “I love roadtrips. ‘Specially ones that go across the country.”
please?
Meg, Kevin, and Garth greeted this with loud whoops and catcalls and, in spite of himself, Castiel couldn’t stop grinning. “Shut up,” he said to them, and they just laughed in response.
Castiel couldn’t stop himself from sighing. A small part of him had been hoping that they’d let him go that night with a little orange bottle and new shiny pair of crutches in hand.
“Your office will suffice.” Michael glanced in the direction of the stairs.
“So tell me,” Dean said through a mouthful of Kung Pao Chicken and Fried Rice about an hour later. “About this fancy-pants school’a yours. Are the other professors bein’ nice to you? Do the kids throw shit in class?”
Castiel hummed. “Well, I always was an overachiever.”
he thought.
“What do you sell at your food truck? If you don’t cook, I mean.”
Dean was worried about Castiel.
“Sure,” Dean replied, looking intrigued. “Though I gotta ask you,” he continued, handing Castiel said satchel. “Do you really think that stayin’ awake is the best thing for your health right now?”
> Dean: way i see it
, he thought,
“And you never thought to tell me that you’re one of the most famous theology scholars in the country?! In the world, even?!”
“Whoa,” Dean protested. “What’re you doin’?”
Dean grinned, his heart singing. “Try’n stop me.”
marshmallow,” Dean insisted in the tone of a petulant child.
Dean hummed in reply, still fixated on his book. For all his insistence about being a slow reader, he was closing in on page two hundred, which was no mean feat when it came to
Castiel swallowed a mouthful of Honey Walnut Shrimp and grinned. “Everyone’s been very welcoming, and they’re all very nice. And no, no one’s throwing anything,” he added pointedly, and Dean gave him the finger. Chuckling, Castiel continued: “The kids are crazy smart, and they’re taking my class because they actually want to learn about world religions, which is refreshing.” He bit into an eggroll. “The department’s definitely going to need some work, though. In the long-term. But I do get quite a bit of time to work on my book, so I’m not complaining.”
“Like Hell.” Dean’s hand pressed slightly against Castiel’s back, becoming a more insistent presence. “Now that you’ve had the dream once, maybe you won’t have to go through it again. You need to sleep, and you’re obviously not okay.”
< Dean Winchester: he’s worse than yesterday, and it looks like he’s already on his 3rd mug of coffee. what do i do??
Castiel considered this. “Actually, I don’t know.” He checked the time on his watch and let out a small huff of frustration. “The tour will have to wait. My class starts in twenty minutes, and I still need to drop off Bastet. And you still need to meet Hael.”
Too exhausted to decorate the tree, they fell prey to Bobby’s old tapes of Tom and Jerry cartoons, laughing themselves into stomach cramps as the night grew older and darker. With a last wipe at his eyes, Bobby said goodnight and stumped upstairs, leaving Sam and Dean to sort out the sleeping arrangements. Dean insisted that Castiel take his bedroom, which had been his since childhood, and that he himself would sleep on the couch. He vehemently shot down all of Castiel’s protests and even carried Castiel’s suitcase upstairs to end the argument (Sam had watched all this with an amused expression).
Their dinner was slow and comfortable; they ate off their laps sitting around the fire, which was warm and blazing against the cold. Castiel had to redouble his efforts to not look at Dean too often, to watch the way the light played against Dean’s freckled skin as he joked with his brother. Then, at some point, Dean threw a pack of playing cards at Castiel’s head and said, “C’mon. Why don’t you teach us some whist?”
“Taking care of you, idiot.”
Castiel turned to look at him. “Dean, you’re as smart as anybody, if not smarter. Just because you struggled with high school algebra and SAT vocabulary doesn’t mean that you’re dumb or worthless. I’ve seen you renovate an engine in less than two hours and shake off a twelve-hour shift like it’s water, and you’re an excellent judge of character. You basically have the temperament of a highly intelligent Golden Retriever, and that’s something I envy. And if you try to refute any of this, you can say goodbye to my apple pie, which is the best in the damn state.” Castiel cracked open his own book (
A sudden, sharp chime rang through the house: Castiel’s doorbell. Castiel’s gaze locked with Dean’s and Dean grumbled a little as he put his uneaten grilled cheese back onto his plate. “I’ll get the door,” Dean said, not unkindly, and Castiel grinned as he reached for his crutches.
Castiel had insisted on driving both his siblings to the airport on Sunday, where they said long goodbyes. Castiel wasn’t ashamed to admit that his eyes had gotten rather misty; Anna sniffled into his shoulder when she hugged him, and even Gabe was blinking more often than necessary. He wasn’t sure what had changed between him and his siblings that made the goodbye so difficult, but then he reasoned with a kind of mental kick that going through what he had gone through with them around had changed everything and reminded them of their childhood relationships, which had been close and deep. Saying goodbye to them now was akin to when he had said goodbye to them when they left for college.
“Yep.” Castiel sucked a mark onto Dean’s neck and was rewarded with a low moan and fingers tangling in his hair (he absently realized that Dean must’ve pulled off his beanie). Dean gently tugged Castiel away from his neck and guided their mouths back together, teeth briefly colliding before they lined up properly and Castiel dove into Dean’s mouth, running his tongue along the roof of Dean’s mouth and tangling with Dean’s tongue. Dean gave a full-body shudder and tightened his grip on Castiel, sliding a hand under the edge of Castiel’s jacket and running his fingers under the waistband of Castiel’s corduroys. Castiel moaned into Dean’s mouth and responded in kind, using the hand not cupping the back of Dean’s head to undo one of the lower buttons of Dean’s coat and pushing Dean’s shirt out of the way, eagerly pressing his hand to the warm skin he found there. Dean gasped and pulled away, his mouth swollen and his eyes blazing. Castiel felt a thrill of pleasure in knowing that
