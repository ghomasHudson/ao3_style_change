“Yeah, what’s up?” Charlie asked, coming into the front room, Cass following behind her, dressed much differently. This time Charlie managed to dress him as an old fashioned monk. A Benedict style robe, done in dark forest chestnut, leather belt, with home spun lighter tan trousers. Leather sandals covered his feet, while at his waist a thick leather belt held a small canteen, a knife sheath which held his Angel blade instead. The hood for the moment was laying behind him, but he could pull it up as needed to hide his face. She had done a good job cause there was no less than 27 other people dressed the exact same way.
“Yeah, like I said if you need more I’ll make more.” Sam started pouring his low sugar, low calorie, and in Gabriel’s opinion, low taste, sparingly over his two cakes.
Okay all I hope you enjoy. Last chapter focusing on Dean and Cass.
“Regurg… the fairies make Angel’s puke?”
“Try it and see.” Sam picked up his own fork but didn’t move to try his own bite just yet.
He then paused as he realized the stupidity of his wish. Of course Dean and Cass were busy with each other this morning. They were busy with each other EVERY morning. Throwing his head back he snarled “God damn it!”
Sam could clearly see the twinkle in his blue eyes, he was teasing his mate and no doubt he would do so again when the opportunity presented itself. Oh yes Cass was a steadying influence on Dean, but Dean was bringing out the Angel’s true personality. Showing him it was okay to have fun, to not take things as seriously, and learning how to tease, joke around and simply have fun.
Smiling with kind humor, “Hungry I understand, you’ve been out for three days.”
Castiel was always so serious and somber, unless Dean was around who would work at bringing his playful side out. In a sudden glimmer of insight Sam looked once more at Gabriel, who had rolled the window down to stick his head out. Most Angels they had dealt with were nothing but a bunch of tight ass dick heads. Cass had been the same way for the most part but sometimes a bit of humor, teasing or mischief would shine from his eyes. He had to have learned that from Gabriel, he was the only Angel they knew of who actively screwed around with people, pulling pranks and other shit on them. He laughed often and understood what humor was. If that was the case why did Castiel not remember much about Gabe? What had happened in the past to make him forget?
“People should be going in and out of those doors. Instead they appear to be milling around confused and scared. I don’t see any real reason as to why they are doing that. But my hunter senses are tingling and telling me trouble is brewing.” He pulled the key and stepped out of the car. Walking to the back he opened the trunk and pulled out the duffle bag they used for jobs. Filling it with basic supplies, salt, iron, holy water and a few others. Gabriel followed him watching as he packed the supplies, then his own eyes widened as Sam loaded up his .45.
“Ugh fine. And knowing you and your hair it will probably take a month to fix, if not two.” Sam was quick to turn his face away, the power which poured out forth from his innocent words, to much for him to look at. Dean gazed around the room looking for his best friend, spotting him leaning against a pillar, causing him to frown. Did Cass need something to eat? He didn’t look tired, but it was hard to tell with the Angel. His eyes were closed and he seemed to concentrating on something. What he hadn’t a clue, but he would get to the bottom of it eventually. “Cass? You with us buddy?” He called out unable to contain all the concern he was feeling.
‘Cass your problems are my problems, and we will figure it out. Remember I’m your’s, you’re mine and the same goes for whatever problems we come across.’ The elder Winchester was firm with his words, leaving no doubt he meant every one of them.
‘I know, I want to be with you too, only you baby.’ Dean continued to stroke Cass, projecting calming thoughts to help keep him in a safe mind set. Tentatively, with extreme caution and no judgment he whispered gently into Castiel ear. “Cass, we’ll have to return eventually,” he paused as he listened to Castiel whimper once more. “But not for a while baby okay? Not till Gabriel is healthy enough to walk on his own. Is that okay? Will that work?”
Those words came into his head suddenly, but when he tried to reach Dean in the same manner, he knew it was useless. Dean had used the last of his power to comfort him one last time. Now he waited unsure if his last wishes would be fulfilled and his sacrifice was in vain. Standing Castiel knew what Dean was doing would not be discarded, it couldn’t be because he loved him to much to ignore what he wanted more than anything. Which was to make sure those he loved was safe from an evil Angel.
“What is?” Dean huffed, feeling the strain of new muscles through his body.
“Dean I think I may have found something.” Sam stated as he brought up his research on the computer. Dean looked up from the book he was reading while Cass was familiarizing himself with the local area. The Angel was on strict orders to not engage in any fighting but Dean still was keeping a sharp ear out for his mate. Going to the local bar and bringing back food shouldn’t be took difficult for him, but one never knew. Cass tended to rub people the wrong way with his natural ignorance and innocence of modern human behavior. He was getting better about it, but sometimes he could get confused and say the wrong thing pissing people off. If that happened, Dean would be off like a shot even though Cass was in no actual danger of being hurt. Still he wouldn’t let his mate take on idiots by himself.
A sudden flaring of brilliant flames and electric violet over a mile away from them distracted him from one of his most intimate secret dreams. Face flaming as he had to adjust himself in front of his love’s younger brother, he pointed with his other hand. “Over there Sam, I can see his wings…”
“Cass we’ve been over this, you don’t need to punish yourself every time you think you’ve failed me.” He squeezed his oil gland, and rubbed it over a particular batch of feathers which did not want to loosen.
“Hey Buddy, grab a couple beers, food is almost ready.”
Nodding she threw her gear into the trunk before sliding into the driver seat. Putting the key in the ignition she went to turn it over and got nothing. “Umm is it supposed to do that?”
Just as Dean was about to cut a line on his forearm, one pissed off Angel of the Lord howled his rage. Shocked Dean turned as he felt nothing but mindless rage and fear radiating from his mate. Castiel’s mind was buried in instincts so deep there was no conscious personality present. Dean staggered as he was overwhelmed as strong arms surrounded him, pinning his wings to his back. Dean only had about three-seconds before Castiel ran and he had to go to plan M and hope to hell it would work. Shouting as he tried to stall a frantic Angel for a few more precious moments. “Sam you’ll have have to finish it.” Then they were both gone, disappearing as Castiel teleported them far from the threat to his mate and own happiness.
“Right and wouldn’t it look weird that he is all 'dressed up’ while you and Castiel are dressed in suits?” Her grin grew, evil gleeful fire flickering in her eyes now. Reflected by the slowly spreading grin on Dean’s face as he realized what was about to happen. Finally sweet, sweet revenge for that damn ride up. “Come with me boys, we have work to do.”
‘Great, and Cass never forget I do love you.’
hope you all enjoy this chapter.
Dean reached up to try and grip his face, only to have his hands batted away, still he tried to get Castiel to focus on him, to bring him back to his normal personality. “Castiel, hey Cass I’m right here, relax, breath baby breath.”
Bowing deeply as a whole, the company accepted the honor with pride in every line of their being. “Thank you my Lord we will not disappoint.”
“Hmm you’re a funny sort, don’t speak much, I kinda like that, shows you might have a brain or could be you’re an idiot. Which is it boy?”
The male Makkin nodded, looking like a pampered house cat only teacup size, he followed the sprite and Gloura quickly. They hopped from branch to branch, flower to flower or stone to stone avoiding all the cold iron they came across. Not all fae had to avoid cold iron but their species were susceptible to it, and it was best if they avoided it. A few minutes later they finally managed to get as close as possible without touching the doors or windows encased in the deadly metal.
More police opened fired, trying to stop the Celestial Being intently focused on protecting what he claimed as his. Again their efforts were ignored as his temper frayed beyond even his tolerance for fools. His mate was in danger, his self appointed task was to protect his most precious love. Nothing would stop him from doing what he saw as his duty, the quick execution of all those who sought to harm his hunter.
“Great…”
Dean shook his vision clear, doing his best to ignore the painful throbbing in his head. Lifting his head at just the right moment, he watched as Castiel was blown across the land towards the wards forming the dark circle. Billows of deathly smoke flowed out of the hole which suddenly opened, pouring forth dozen of creatures he had never seen the likes of before. They swarmed over his mate, placing him in cuffs and a brutal looking collar before starting to drag him towards the opening they had come from.
Sam was waiting next to the driver’s door, keeping an eye out for police, when Dean swooped down beside him. Giving a very manly yelp of fright he jumped while aiming a punch at his laughing brother. “NOT FUNNY DEAN!” He snarled before taking a deep breath and calming himself down.
“She chose to perform it Commander, she chose to send what was left of the regiment back home. You would bring dishonor on her sacrifice by thinking it should have been you.” Still he could understand, it was never easy for those who were left behind or those who lived to live with the knowledge they should have done more.
I hope you all enjoyed this latest chapter. Ended up being about twice as long as I thought it would be.
Stunned at his words, Dean pulled back to look him better in the eyes, wings opening allowing more silver moonlight in to reflect off their chests. “What? What do you mean you can’t have me?”
Waving his hands around, before running them through his hair, trying to get his mind back on the matter at hand. “Fine, fine, now how long is he going to be out?” Already he was making plans, but they needed a safe place to go. He turned to start packing up his bedroll and air mattress, he had a feeling they would need it for Dean later.
“Sam we going?” Gabriel asked, breaking him out of his thoughts.
“Yep I’m good. Now eat your food, I can see Dean eyeing your plate and he isn’t pleased.” Sam took a forkful of his own food, fond smile as he watched Cass glance at Dean before picking up his own. Very particular about his Angel eating properly was Dean, ever since they found out Cass’s system now required the extra energy after his mating.
“Sure, sure,” Dean said distractedly, eyeing that tub because plans were starting to form. There might be some boat motoring going on tonight. His dick was definitely showing interest, which was traveling through their bond and peaking his mate’s interest. Water games they had played before, but never in a jacuzzi, this could be fun.
Which is exactly what the Angel did a few minutes later when he too woke. Dean managed to contain his whimper of disappointment at the loss, only sighing in resignation. He knew it would happen and he didn’t fight it, not when he knew his attention wasn’t wanted. Rolling over, he refused to look at the Angel who was towering over him, stretching arms and wings before standing himself.
Once he finished sneezing and coughing, never noticing how his wings seemed to glow just that much brighter for a few precious seconds, he continued, “Sammy I’m tired of these flapping mood rings damn it. I just want to go back to normal.” He felt something in his throat, and coughing harder, ended up hawking up a ball of dark ruined rainbow flume. He spit it into a convenient trash can. Then wrinkled his nose up as it slowly oozed down the side wall.
The wind picked up, bringing the stench of decay, miasma and death towards the guarding pair. These were beings who had killed things, eaten them raw and were hungry for more. Their eyes said it all, gleeful at the thought of slowly tearing them apart and eating them either alive or at their leisure. Seeking revenge at the death to those animals which had been their guards and pets. As they moved, vermin crawled over their poxed skin, black specs jumping from crotch to torso to hair, ignored by the trolls as commonplace to them.
Rolling his eyes, Sam couldn’t help the fond smile. “Come on let’s get some lunch. We can head to the bank afterward.” Holding the door open for the Archangel he waved the shorter man in.
Sam stumbled at her last sentence. “What Charlie oh hell no, I am not telling my brother he needs to “shag” Cass.” Just the thought made him sick, his brother’s sex life something he never liked thinking of.
Not really paying attention to his words as he moved to the back of the car. “Good could you open the trunk then.”
“Dean damn it what are you doing?” Cass hollered throughly confused as to why Dean wanted to carry him instead of the cat.
“Something is lurking around the camp ground. Not sure what, but some of the others have seen large paw prints, which seem to just disappear. Also we’ve heard things like roars and screams like banshee’s or something. It's weird and I have no idea what it could be.” Charlie’s voice was growing louder the longer she spoke, her concern weaving through every word.
Dean snarled as the creature managed to dodge, though he scraped his blade against her ribs as she moved. Continuing his dive he focused on how she now was behind him, trying to catch him. But his wings were not based off a peregrine falcon for nothing, he shot towards the ground a new plan churning in his mind. Looking over his shoulder, he could see he was being followed, how she was struggling to catch him. He opened his wings a fraction, slowing his fall just enough to make her think she could reach him.
“I’ll be honest with you, he’s still very weak and sickness is starting to claim him. I’ve burned it out but it was odd, like it wasn’t done with him.” He would have to hit the books tomorrow to find out what could be causing it. Not to mention they would have to figure out why Gabriel was out there in the first place.
Another chapter done, pace starting to pick up a bit.
Archangel.
What he discovered had him paling in unbelieving denial at what was before him.
“I’ll stay with him Sam, go check on what you need to, I can keep track via Dean. Get some sleep in your own bed, I have Gabriel.”
The short pointy eared fuck was all set to murder Commodus, but Gabe wanted to be the one to do it. And so they kept foiling their various plots and shenanigans to the point they were getting nothing else done. Cokeblower was still fucking things up and not giving a damn who he screwed over, at least when the screwing didn’t include what poor equipment he had to begin with. Good people were dying for no reason, the fae folk were about to bring down the wrath of their own forest people.
Dean grabbed his brother and shoved him through the side opening. “Go damn it, stop fucking around.” He whirled around, lifting his own wings in intimidation.
Dean didn’t think it was any safer, not at this stage of their relationship yet. He hadn’t even had a chance to talk to Cass about exploring taking it further. To figuring out what he needed to do to make himself worthy of being with the Angel. Because to have Cass so intimately, knowing nothing more would come from it after this point would hurt to much. Especially since Castiel had told him multiple times he didn’t want him, or more accurately couldn’t have him. And if in the end it was still not possible for Castiel to take him, well he would understand. After all he knew that there was no real happy ending for him. Besides he would only be punishing himself by being with Cass once and living in torture of could have beens and if only wishes. His heart honestly couldn’t take that much pain in to itself.
Rolling over, he slowly dragged himself to the back of the Jeep, pulling the handle to let him open the door. Sliding his ass out, he staggered as he settled on his feet, his legs pretty much cramped jello for the moment. Using a hand to steady himself on the bumper he slowly stretched his body, listening as his spine cracked and groaned at the feeling. His wings lifted as he stretched, feathers fluffing up as they moved in freedom once again.
He easily found the old trail the panther told him about, how it would lead to an old den of his. There was fresh water and plenty of hunting in the area, they would supply his human with what he needed. While he hadn’t been pleased to be a messenger and trail guide, he realized he might have been harder on the man than he intended. The human had kept up despite his very physical needs, at least till the end. So he offered his apologies in the form of a place to rest and recover for both of them. Only he couldn’t go with them, the jungle was filled with a presence which made his fur crawl. It was driving out all the predators of the area, and only through the one who had sent him, was he able to come this far. If he went any further he would actually bring attention to the men. They were under another being’s protection, wouldn’t be detected for some time, for the pathway they had followed cloaked those who traveled through it. And there were multiple openings one could come out of from the main passage. So while they were anticipated from those who would do them ill, they didn’t know exactly where they would be coming out.
Now they were stuck in a cave, in the middle of nowhere, no food to be had and little water. There was a tiny trickling spring a few feet from the entrance of the cave, but it tasted heavily of minerals. More than what any of the humans enjoyed drinking. Cass purified what Sam had managed to collect after their first failed hunting trip, till he started swaying on his own feet. When Dean spotted him struggling, he had come over and placed his hand over his own glowing one, stopping his work. Green eyes had looked at him with concern, before he released his hand. The order was clear to the Angel, stop before he hurt himself, clearing the water wasn’t as important as Castiel getting his own rest.
“However way you want.” Dean moaned breathlessly, he didn’t care just as long as Cass kept playing with him. Kept touching him, smoothing the cool clay over his over heated skin.
(See the end of the chapter for
‘You may be ignoring it but I sure as shit am not mate. We WILL talk about this when we get home.’ The menace blazing down their bond caused Dean to stagger in the air for a second. Oh yeah Cass would certainly do more than talk when he could lay his hands on his hunter next.
I hope you all enjoyed this chapter.
“Where do they keep coming from? I didn’t think there were this many.” Dean snarled as he blocked a female from ripping his head off.
Sam moving with careful steps, making sure to keep his hands in sight to help keep the Angel calm. “Kay Dean, can you explain anything?” He placed the stone bowl, made of a green and gold granite on the table before his brother.
For the next few hours Sam left the tv on the reports station, all reported by the same beige man droning on, voice only broken when the man had to sniff loudly, then blow into his beige handkerchief. Gabriel fell asleep from extreme boredom through the day, but each time he woke up, Sam could tell Gabe would look for him to see if he was still in the room. When he realized he was, Gabe would twitch but gamely watched the dull and stodgy man. What was the worst though was when Sam would leave him, with the tv on taking the remote with him. Gabe couldn’t get up and turn the tv off, otherwise his little ruse would be discovered. Couldn’t turn the sound off, he could try reading a book but the only one around was the encyclopedia of earthworms and their life cycle around the globe. It had only black and white pictures, was written in the 1960’s and weighed at least 1000 pounds it seemed like. He tried reading it, he honestly did, only to have to close it, he swore the author was the same man who was reading those god damn reports.
‘Not now Cass we really don’t have time to deal with worth issues.’ Still he sent him a mix of love, devotion and lust towards his mate. Flying behind Castiel after all gave him a really great view of his ass.
Sighing Dean let the warm water from the rain head cascade over his body as Castiel groomed his wings properly this time. His Angel adored grooming his feathers and he loved it too, plus it was much easier to do so with another person. He frowned as he was reminded once again about how his wings weren’t perfect. Oh he could fly rings around just about anything. But the maintenance part was on the tedious side, since he couldn’t produce enough wing oil to coat them the way they needed to be. And what oil he did produce, didn’t last very long so had to be reapplied often, normally at least once a day.
Dean still breathing harshly, cock slowly deflating from his truly wondrous climax. “Cass it’s come, not semen, that’s just gross.”
A foul breeze coursed by him, bringing with it the screams of those souls being tortured, unknown creatures howling in pain and rage, and the gleeful laughter of beings taking pleasure in their evil. He shivered as he listened, determined not cross the path of anyone who lived here. The wind blowing over his skin was just short of burning from heat, sweat broke out on his body, under his arms, his back, hell his ass was even starting to sweat. And the smell, it was filled with the stench of sulphur, decay and despair. Air thick with smoke, dust and no doubt the remains of those who perished in this region of death, made him cover his nose. He didn’t want to breath any more of the horrible debris but feared he had no choice.
Opening the door he already started growling at the younger man. “Damn it Dean, how many times have I told you not to push…” He stuttered to a halt midway when he took in the sight before him.
“Sure Boss, let me know if you need anything else.”
“I agree, so I suggest we probably should find the source of the trouble and put a stop to it. If they are around they will no doubt be here to cause us trouble.”
“Hopefully not long but I have to keep them off your trails till Cass is ready to get us home. This is one of those times where we don’t have the time to drive home. Now get ready, I’m heading out.”
Once the bunker sensed all the intruders were deceased and no longer a threat to its charges, it powered down most the heating systems leaving just two still active. It would take hours to cool, for the systems had to make sure every particle of enemy was in fact a particle. It would be highly uncomfortable for the hours of heat the bunker would be in, but it was a better alternative to being dead. It was now time to engage the humidity system to ensure certain resources found all through the building were also preserved as some should not be exposed to extreme heat for long or at all.
Before the Queen could do so her daughter spoke up. “Robin I would ask a boon of you if I may.”
“I can heal him Sam, give me a few minutes.” Sapphire light began to shine, contrasting with the gold glimmering from his hand.
“Cass? Sam?” Dean murmured, blinking groggy green eyes as he woke.
Cass was about to respond when Dean walked in, tray stacked with food as he carefully placed it on the dresser. “Sammy the decision is made, I won’t have Cass stressing over this, it means to much to him. I won’t put my mate’s wellbeing to the side any more.”
Turning a corner, he stopped at the sight which was before him. It appeared to be a nest of filth in the back of the furthest corner. More bones than he cared to count were strewn everywhere, rags which used to be clothes from the victims tossed carelessly. Moving his light, he could see how the walls were covered in old congealed blood stains, or at least he hoped it was blood stains because some of the walls appeared to be bubbling or frothing. Dirt mixed with the puddles of water and other liquids, forming a decaying form of mud which was slippery to walk on or in.
Further towards the mountains found the three combatants engaging in battle. The night had fallen to true night, the only light provided by the nearly full moon and the stars shining above. While all three didn’t notice they were high enough up that the air was hard to breath, the temperature cool enough to keep the snow year round, and a very steep incline swarming with firs, cedars, pine, spruce and willows. Animals had run far from the sounds crying out above them and no birds dotted the skyline, though they had burst into the air when they first arrived. Now it was only the three fighting to bring each other down.
Trees, rocks, plants exploded in a riot of debris, surprising the trolls as they were struck by them. The creatures screamed as the holy light hit them, burning them from the inside out, the foul odor as they vaporized would take him centuries to purge from his memories. And as he figured his instincts, now that they were allowed to use his full strength, was giving no mercy. They demanded he burn the area to the ground, destroy everything which was a threat to his mate. He started to shake as they took over, fueled by the danger the unknown creature Sam had found represented.
“I am not a liberty to explain my Lord. I was not present at the time and have no first hand knowledge as to what took place.”
“Get whatever you want buddy,” was the gruff reply as the elder buried his nose in his own menu to hide his face. Not that it did any good when Cass could feel how happy Dean was that his mate liked his little surprise.
Course I’m not. I’m happy for you crazy kids. Besides, I’m about to save so much on groceries.
CLAIRE
Don’t worry about it, Cas. Besides, we gotta keep the kid around to do all the heavy lifting around here anyways.
WAITER
CUT TO:
You’re nothing like him, you know. I don’t think that man could ever love anything, but
And you’re Claire! Castiel has shown me pictures on his phone.
Great, that settles it. Split up and search for clues. Sammy, you and Cas can go look for Sister Jo, Dad and I can stay here and-
You can’t kill him,
CLAIRE
I went to high school! It looks so fun on
What was that?
Jack, if you don’t listen to your dad we can always drive you back to Jody’s. Both of you.
Cass speaking quietly, tilting his head to the side as he looked at the elder hunter. “You don’t remember the events yesterday?”
“There you go. Keep making those pretty sounds for me,” Cas grinned down at him before leaning in to capture his lips in a rough kiss. Dean quickly opened up for him, allowing his boyfriend to dominate his mouth completely. As the kiss broke off, Cas moved so sit next to him on the bed again, one hand resting comfortingly on his stomach. Dean put weight on his elbows, wanting to follow, but one sharp look from the other man made him rest back onto the bed. That earned him a soft smile and a gentle hand playing with his hair.
“Yeah, me too.” He had pulled shit like this before they moved in together. Back when he was convinced that Cas would understand that he was better off alone, or with someone else. With someone who knew how to be in a proper relationship. Someone who could communicate in a proper way, without losing their temper or just confusing everyone in the process. But now he was doing it again. Pushing Cas away. For what? To make him stay? That was seriously stupid.
Cas suddenly sat up until he was kneeling over him. Then he ran his hands slowly down the other’s shoulders and chest, stopping to pay extra attention to his nipples. Dean swallowed the groan that wanted to erupt as both his nipples were pinched hard.
“Why are you doubting my commitment to you now?”
“We need to talk about this.”
“Cas.
“Stop. Hands on the bed.”
As Cas rose from the bed, Dean grabbed his hand. He closed his lips around the other’s thumb, biting down as gently as possible, while meeting his husband’s eyes with a meaningful look.
“Words Dean.” The tone was strict, but then softer. “If they are back with you now.”
Dean fastened his grip and speed his movement to a pace that would have him desperate in no time.
“Why?” He grunted, giving the pea bags a dirty look.
“Imprudent boy,” Cas smacked his hip lightly. “I want to worship you, just let yourself enjoy it.” With that he picked up a purple marker, putting the tip of it against the skin right above Dean’s hipbone.
“Do you know what I think?” Cas moved so his knees where on the other side of the other’s hips, rested his hands next to Dean’s head, and leant down so their faces were mere inches apart. “I think you’re trying to rile me up. I think you’re being difficult
“Oh yes,” Cas continued in an even voice. “You, Dean Winchester, is one of the most selfless people I have ever met. You give so much of yourself to others. You say yes to helping out whenever the chance occurs, with no regard for how it will affect you. Every fiber of your being seems determined to change the world for the better. Your selflessness was one of the first things I noticed about you.”
The last sentiment was followed up by Castiel sucking the head of Dean’s dick into his mouth. Then he blew him with an enthusiasm that seemed to say that blowing Dean was his favourite activity. It did not take long before Dean was coming down his throat with a noise that was closer to a scream than a moan.
“I presumed you would. Now you’re going to lay back, relax, and stay as still as possible, while I cover your skin in all the reasons I love you.”
“I’m not talking about right now. Not even the next time we fight,” he said, directed to the closet. “I want you to stay with me forever. And it scares the hell out of me.”
“You are,” Castiel agreed. “But that is not quite what I asked you to say.”
His movement stilled immediately, but he clutched the base of his cock for a few deep breaths before he was calm enough to place his hand back on the bed. Perhaps even closer than Cas would have taken him if the former had been doing the touching.
“I’m not changing
“Yeah, yeah. I know.” Dean looked away from that intense gaze, focusing on his hand that was clutching the comforter instead. His boyfriend was right of course, he’d been really short tempered lately. And for him that was really saying something. But why now? There wasn’t like anything had changed between them. Except, maybe….
A shift of the mattress woke him up. The room was still dark, but he could make out the silhouette of another person sat next to him on the bed. Gentle fingers pried the pillow he was still holding from his hands. He let go, but propped himself up on one arm. His movement were slow, brain still foggy from sleep.
“Touch yourself for me,” Cas said, giving a significant gaze down to the others cock, then back up to his eyes. Dean starred at him for a moment before he followed the order, slowly jacking himself off. This seemed too simple. Was this evening really all about pleasure? And affection or whatever?
“What?!” Dean turned around so quickly he was surprised he didn’t pull a muscle. It seemed like he had missed out on a rather important part of the conversation.
“I’m glad you came back,” Dean murmured into the darkness, half-hoping the other wouldn’t hear him. Of course, he had no such luck.
"Still. I do love you in these." The voice continued, while two familiar shackles were fasted around his wrists, keeping them together. He let out a relieved breath. He had been good enough. Still enough. And now he was rewarded with help. Handcuffs to stop him from touching, and the blindfold to keep him from getting lost in everything around them. All he could do now was listen and feel. And all that filled his senses was Castiel as the man moved to stand in front of him.
“I. Love. You. Too,” he whispered slowly, his tongue feeling clumsy around the words. His husband hummed happily and hugged him tight.
That was the only incentive he needed. He opened his mouth and sank down on the length in front of him. A hand tangled into his hair at the same time, but the grip was weak, so he ignored it in favour of bobbing up and down on the cock. Pulling out all the stops, he alternated between taking as much as he could in his mouth, running his tongue up the vein on the underside, and sucking hard on the head. Deep groans of pleasure from his Dom spurred him to take the length even deeper, and swallowing around it as it hit the back of his throat.
He did. With fast strokes, spurred on by the hands exploring his body. Every time Cas pinched his skin or twisted a nipple, he moaned loudly. All the touches went straight to his dick, and within a couple of minutes he was writhing on the bed, barely able to contain the orgasm.
A sudden feeling of a marker over his skin almost made him flinch, but he managed to stay still as not to mess up the other man’s work. Peering down, he saw his boyfriend with a blue marker in hand, obviously continuing where he had left off earlier.
“Anyway, I believe in you.” Cas grinned. “Now be quiet, I need to concentrate on my work.”
“See something you like?” Dean asked, letting his tongue dart over his bottom lip for good measure.
“You’re really confusing my senses here.”
“And I already told you, I’m not going anywhere.”
“You’re doing remarkably well.” Cas left a kiss to each of his cheeks and the tip of his nose. Dean whimpered in return, struggling to keep himself from pleading for release. He really needed to come. Preferable five minutes ago. Instead, his boyfriend took up the red marker again, and started writing on the right side of his stomach. Dean couldn’t find the energy to read the words anymore, but it was impossible to ignore the several times Cas murmured “good boy” into his skin while he kissed around the new words. In return, Dean let out an undignified sound somewhere between a whimper and a moan. He was being
“So beautiful,” Cas said, leaving a small kiss slightly under his left nipple. It was followed by the familiar sensation of the marker on Dean’s skin. Familiar, but still different than when their niece was ‘making him pretty’ as she liked to call it. Cas’ hand seemed surer and less hesitant than Claire often was. And the skin of his sides and stomach was more sensitive than his arms and calves, which were usually the body parts decorated. As the pen stopped its motion, Dean looked down his body. Sure enough, the word
“Want me to get you off too?” He asked with a grin, eyes slowly drifting down the others body.
“Yes,” Cas said with a fond smile. “Of course I’ll bring you something to eat as well.”

He was unable to answer in any way other than taking several deep breaths through his nose. They had worked towards this for a long time. If he could manage this now, manage to properly please his Dom, then everything else would be forgiven. Not that Castiel would hold it against him if he still needed more training. But he needed this himself. Needed to be good. To please. To pleasure.
Dean tensed for a moment. This wasn’t how it was supposed to go. He’d tried to pick a fight. There was too many emotions and he needed to get them out, to throw them at someone’s face. But instead of letting him, his boyfriend decided to be all caring again. It was hard to follow.
“Good boy. Now, where were we?” Cas looked down at his writing, tracing the words with a gentle finger. At that point, even the small gesture was enough to push Dean towards the edge. He shook with self-restraint, clutching the sheets hard and focusing on his breathing.
with his pleasing sounds.” Cas smiled down at him, while stroking over his stomach in small circles. “And you are so good to everyone Dean. You care so much. I’m in awe of the love you show to all the people around you. Such a wonderful,
Dean shrugged, pointedly keeping his eyes glued to the closet doors. Cas ought to dream bigger for himself.
“You, my sweet boy, somehow always exceed my expectations,” was murmured into his hipbone. “You are more than good enough.” Followed by a kiss to the base of his cock. “And you may come when you please.”
“You’re so incredible Dean. Both under me like this and out there in our daily lives.” The statement was sealed with a kiss to his right cheek. Dean whimpered slightly, and the hand around his cock tightened in response. How could Castiel still think so highly of him after a day like this?
Dean let out a long breath as dark silk covered his eyes and Castiel’s talented fingers tied it behind his head. The blindfold felt comforting against his skin, the loss of sight more soothing than anything.
“I’m here Dean. I’m not leaving you.” Cas murmured the words into his hair before leaving a soft kiss on his forehead. With a rush of air from his lungs, Dean felt the tension leave his body. Cas was here. Despite everything, he was home.
With those words, he started to kiss and bite his way down Dean’s body. Simultaneously, he snuck a hand around to massage the Sub’s ass-cheeks. Dean’s erection perked up at the change in activity, quickly desperate for attention.
Dean leaned into the touch, letting the words wash over him. He was being good, doing everything that was asked of him. He had failed in so many other ways today. But this, staying still and quiet for his Dom’s pleasure, this he could do. This he would do.
"So eager," Castiel chuckled. "Who am I to deny my sweet boy anything?"
I love you too, Dean thought loudly. I love you too. I love you too! It was as close to screaming as he could do in his mind.
“Sensitive today are we?” Castiel chuckled lightly. Dean said nothing in return, only looked away in a futile attempt to hide his blush. Now that he was reminded of just how turned on he was, he was unable to ignore it. He just needed.
“’M so close. Please Cas.”
“Then that’s for another day.”
His movements stopped, but he looked pleadingly up at the other man. “
“Good,” Cas said. He ran one hand through Dean’s hair, tugging slightly before letting go. Dean leaned into the touch, whimpering slightly as it disappeared. “Remember these?” Cas pulled a bunch of pens out of his pocket. Except, these weren’t normal pens. They were the temporary tattoo markers they had bought for when Claire was desperate to draw on them. Cas had insisted that they were better for their skin than regular pens, and their niece was overjoyed with the vibrant colors that were much easier to cover their arms with.
The door slammed closed after Castiel with a loud bang. It made their new closet rattle and Dean wince. They really had to fasten that to the wall before it hurt somebody. Certainly before he let any of their little nephews or nieces anywhere near it without supervision.
“No,” Cas said firmly. “On Saturday I will have you collared on your knees with my cock in your mouth while I research my next paper, but I have a different plan for tonight. Are you going to be a brat and question my decisions, or will you be still and obedient like my good boy ought to?”
Little bit of smut, some action and adventure. Graphic description of injuries to bad guys. So there is going to be some icky parts.

“Sorry Sam, it was not intentional that you heard our morning activities.” Cass apologized.
Sam watched the pair working together to help the older Angel. He wished he could lend his own strength to the fight for his life but it was not to be. He was a regular human, he had no special bond to a Celestial being who shared a life with another. Still looking down at the broken being, he couldn’t help but wish he could help Gabe out like Dean was doing with Cass. Gabriel didn’t deserve whatever had befallen him to put him in this tortured condition, and when he finally found out what happened, he sure as shit was going to do his best to get revenge for him. No being should be able to do this to another and live.
“Very well, but if I do not like what I am about to hear, there were be an influx of paperweights in the palace.”
“Garth said something about a place called Tula? I’m not sure.” He glanced at Cass before resuming his surveillance of the area. The foot traffic was light at this time of day for a wonder. Must have caught the townspeople while most were out shopping.
Pulling his pistol out he started to step into the room when…
He continued to suck, losing himself in the pleasure of pleasing his love. Till he was violently ripped away from the shaft he was sucking happily on. “Whaaaaaa?” He stuttered out in surprise.
SPNSPNSPN
Some time later, cheek pressed against Castiel’s head, wings groomed and put away for the moment, Dean whispered in his head. ‘We’re being watched.’
He lifted his gun, sending another white hot flare at one of the bastards. They had learned their lesson after watching a few of their members get hit and burned alive. Dean had been especially pleased when he hit one in the dick; the male had screamed as his member was burned off before the rest of his body followed. The female trolls were enraged at the loss of the male, he had been one of the largest and probably their best breeder, if the large bellies of the females was anything to go by.
“Hush Dean, it’s easier this way.” Cass whispered as he carried his mate over the threshold of the stone pathway. His eyes adjusting easily to the difference in light, and he realized the first rays of the sun were just kissing the horizon. So it was true they had walked all night and Dean hadn’t been allowed to rest at all.
“No Dean, it won’t affect me flying. Most of the feathers have already been replaced, the old feathers are stuck between the new ones.” His cock started to shrivel as the topic changed to one less passionate. Feather plucking was not romantic when one’s mate discovered he was molting out of season.
‘I like that movie Dean, you were the one to show it to me.’
Snarling in outrage, “Guard where are the ones I ordered to be here? They were expected at this very hour!”
Racing up to large tent, both men slid through the tent flaps. “Charlie? Cass you in here?” Sam called out, heading to the back of the pavilion.
“Sí” Castiel didn’t see any reason to deny what he had told the woman last night.
They parted company after that, only to come across each other from time to time. Typically when some idiot and gained their joint attention and they set about their routine. Out prank each other till they finally made a last bet and see who could kill the guy. Puck typically won cause of some last minute run of bad luck… wait a minute…
His words were not great. That was the truth. Not great, he repeated to himself. Not great. Not great. Not great. “Not great,” he answered in a barely audible whisper.
“Not tonight. I already got all I wanted.” He did this every once in a while. Actually, he did it rather often. As if he got more pleasure from getting Dean off than actually having an orgasm of his own. It wasn’t anything Dean could pretend like he understood, but Cas surely knew his own wants best. He was certainly direct enough about shoving his cock down the others throat when he felt like it.
Dean’s hand moved almost on autopilot, wrapping around his cock and jacking it with sure movements. He kept his eyes open this time, taking in all the emotion in his boyfriend’s eyes. No one could convey emotion through a look quite like Cas. And he was using that ability now to express all the love he insisted that Dean deserved. It was enough to make a guy believe him.
“Don’t be quiet on my account,” Cas said, pinching even harder. Then he let go off the left one, only to bend down and bite it. Dean moaned, arching his back into the pleasure-pain sensation.
“One day yeah. Maybe.”
“Dean.” This time the word conveyed affection, and quite a lot of sorrow. “If only you could see yourself thought my eyes. You’re everything I’ve ever wanted.”
“Why does it bother you more that I’m writing in color that that I’m doing it in the first place? You seem to have your priorities mixed up sweetheart.”
“That you are,” Castiel agreed easily, then gave him a firm kiss. “Now let me take care of you sweet boy.”
He nodded slightly in return and rested his head back on the pillow. His Dom climbed up on the bed, and sat over him on his hands and knees, one leg resting on either side of Dean’s hips. Castiel’s lips moved to his collarbone, kissing and nibbling at it, while his hand moved to Dean’s left nipple, rolling it lightly before pinching it.
Somehow during the last four years he’d convinced himself that this relationship was different. It was with
His hands shook as he dried off, walked back to the bedroom, and pulled on a pair of boxers and sleep pants. Then he turned towards the bed, but paused for a moment. This wasn’t right. He needed… something. What he actually needed was Cas, but seeing how that was out of the question… With a small sigh, he walked over to Cas’ side of the closet and pulled out one of his favorite worn t-shirts. It was faded black with a big bee in the middle, surrounded by the words ‘To bee, or not to bee’. Like all of Cas’ t-shirts, it was incredibly soft. Dean buried his face in it for a moment before he put it on and went to bed.
“That’s uncalled for.” Dean tried to scold his face into annoyed, but couldn’t keep a smile from breaking out. Apparently Cas was not in a lecturing, or self-hating, mood. This was going much better than expected.
“That seems about right yeah.”
“Turn around,” Castiel murmured with a light push to his left hip. He did so without question, straightening up as a hand ran down his back. There was a familiar click, then the handcuffs were removed from his wrists, leaving only emptiness in their wake. A small whimper left his lips, unbidden. It was not enough. He still needed to be good. Needed to be better.
“Yes.
“So good for me,” Cas murmured, then leaned down to kiss his stomach. “I love seeing you like this. So desperate to please.”
“Dean.”
“Then I shall only ask for a few of them,” Castiel replied and kissed him again. This one was all comfort and love, lips moving slowly against each other. Like they had all the time in the world.
“You, Dean Winchester, is an incredible human being,” Castiel finally said against his lips. “And you are more than good enough. I want you to repeat that back to me. Tell me you’re more than good enough.”
“Please.” He wasn’t sure what he was asking for, but his boyfriend seemed to have enough ideas of his own. As long as Cas gave him something.
He could not contain the pleasant shudder that went through his body at those words. All he wanted to do was please, and for now he seemed to be doing everything right.
“None of that,” Castiel growled. As if he could read Dean’s mind. Perhaps he could? The hand on his cock had stilled. A proof of how he had disappointed his Dom. Again. “No matter what your mind keeps telling you, you’re always good enough for me.”
Then again maybe not as the Angel snarled as he moved as only he could, putting everyone down within seconds of each other. He then waved his hand and shoved all the cars blocking the way out. For good measure he tapped each one causing all four wheels to go flat at once.  Turning he scowled at Sam “Samuel I said to get Gabriel in the car, why are you still standing there?”
He screamed second time, Cass sucking hard on his already sensitive shaft, but reaching up with his second hand and twisting his right nipple as he thrust four fingers in his hole and pressed hard. Dean’s hands dug into the ground around him, finding little to grip in the slippery surface. Cass continued to suck, twist and press as he made him come till he was completely dry and drained. Releasing him, he gazed down at his mate with satisfaction before flipping him over. Dean fully blissed out took a few moments to realize Cass had flipped him. Arms barely supporting him, his knees digging into the cooling mud, back dripping, ass covered in muck, he was floating in a world of pleasure he had no interest in leaving.
“Of course My Lord. We are ready to go now.”
‘I love you too mate, now hold on to my wing so we can get this done and over with.’ His tone was firm, refusing to accept any other arguments or actions. He would not continue till his mate was gripping his wing properly.
“Fae folk? You mean fairies?” Dean asked him quietly puzzled. “Why would you think that?”
“Dean come on it wasn’t that bad.” Sam followed behind him, carrying their duffels. Dean refused to let Cass carry them. Not when he was pissed off at his brother and wanted to inconvenience him in some manner. Cass wisely kept his mouth shut while the brothers verbally dueled.
Oh the idea was temping, but…”No, I’ll call them in, you go and deal with the search parties. But please talk to the captain of the Forest Rangers, update her as to who we are searching for, if they have seen any large birds around and anything else you can think of. I’ll be busy dealing with the logistics of bringing in National Guardsmen.”
“Cass? Tell me what we should be doing here?”
“GABRIEL, what the hell?” Sam exclaimed as he pulled him closer to his chest. “Did you kill them?” If so what did it cost him?
“As if I didn’t know that silly boy. But Dean said it needed to be CREATED by the first born. The spell is created, now FINISH IT!” She shoved him over to where Dean had been.
Coughing for another minute, the Angel was finally able to raise his head. “I will be, but I could really do with a drink.” A drink and some privacy to clean his system once and for all. He would be paying a little visit to Elfhame at his first opportunity, the Fae could not be allowed to interfere with Heavenly hosts without consequences.
Castiel though was thinking of other things, “Yes, but we will think of something Dean, I know you won’t leave while those people and any others are threatened by this.” The less they dwelled on his brother the happier he was for the moment.
“I understand, let's just get to it.” He walked away from Castiel, not wanting to make eye contact. No wonder they tied him up, if this was going to be the result. He was sure Cass wasn’t happy with them, not if the pure soul sucking black of his wings was anything to go by. Or the icy steel trying to lance his heart.
“Wait someone stole a tunnel?” Dean grinned at the idea, turning as he felt a swipe of a pissed off cat, who really had better things to do then lead two idiots around in the dark. He had been hunting that really sweet female for the last couple of days. He thought he had finally persuaded her to make a match of it, when he got called to do this bullshit.  He was totally going to take a nap after all this nonsense was done.
Nuzzling his cheek in deep affection, ‘I’m not alone Dean, never alone.’ Which was true, ever since he had mated Dean, he had never felt alone. His hunter was always floating in the back of his mind, residing in his heart and permanently bonded to his soul. Before he had met Dean he had always felt alone, even when surrounded by thousands of other Angels. Only with Dean did his loneliness go away, to be replaced with the feeling of belonging.
“Good plan, where is my room?” But a shiver of dread went down his spine when he saw the shit eating grin on his brother’s face.
SPNSPNSPN
Leaning forward he whispered in his mate’s ear. “I want you to remember this Dean, remember why I’m doing this and learn. Understand?”
He was just about to break the tree line when he spotted the familiar red and blue lights of many police cars, along with a few ambulances. Sighing he knew he was going to have to worm his way around them, it would not be good to be spotted. Casting his eyes about, he could see an area which was darker than the rest, a kind of foot path, but few people in relation to the others were on it. No doubt the cops would also be highly distracted with having to interview nearly 400 or maybe it was 500 people now?
“You’re always busy, all of you and yet you never tell me what it is you do?” The interloper said with a chuckle. Gabe wanted to rip his lips off for chuckling at Sam. It wasn’t this asshole’s business what his Hunter did.
Tangerine wings glimmered with amusement.
Shaking his head,“No Dean I’ll help Sam with Gabriel, instead I want you to go and prepare a room for him.”
Gabriel had been living in the city, watching how Commodus built statues to himself, good looking ones, rather than based off what he really looked like. For example he gave himself a HUGE dick, damn thing had to have been at least 14 inches long and thick as a tree branch. While in reality, it was maybe only six and looked like a limp noodle flopping along his thigh. He had been working as a palace cleaner, scrubbing floors, walls, and over all just being a nosy bastard. On more than one occasion he had seen the dirt-bag naked as the day he was born, fit but very far from fine. On the other hand, he liked Commodus’s dad, he had been cool, smart and wasn’t a lazy coke snorting sex fiend. So seeing his son blow through all his Dad’s accomplishments had rubbed him raw, reminded him of his own family. One son blowing through his Father’s best works.
Shaking his head, his shoulders drooped. “I may have my full powers, but the evil and corruption radiating from this place, no it’s much stronger than what a single Angel can cleanse. An Archangel could do so probably, but for one of my rank no I would need help.”
The Impala purred down the highway, covering mile after mile with nary a complaint from herself or her wards. Dean was at the wheel as was normal, Sam was sitting next to him with Cass gazing out the window in the back. Sam had offered to sit in the back but had been turned down by both Dean and Cass. Evidently they figured they would not be able to keep their hands off each other if they were sitting together. Which was probably a good idea, Castiel more than likely would have reached for Dean, taking his hand, playing with his fingers, before sliding his hand over his thigh. Once that started, Dean wouldn’t be able to help himself as his dick would start to take an interest in what his mate was doing.
“Just what the hell is going on Scout Master? Why were my orders ignored? Heads will roll for this insult!” His entire body was quivering in rage.
“Okay mine are done, and I can feel you getting sappy about grooming. So if you’re going to do that. Turn around buddy so I can do yours.” Dean demanded, affection and fondness coating his words.
“Dean, you awake? Thank god. How are you feeling?” The familiar voice of his brother, was filled with extreme worry.
Epilogue
“Yeah here take a look and see if you can read this.” Dean passed the book over to him, watching as he flipped through the pages.
Eyes closed tightly, panting at how much his panic attack had cost him, ‘Do it Dean, just get it over with.’ And how saying those words cost him so much.
I mean,
Dean?
It’s alright, it’s alright, Jack. Everything’s okay.
Like you did?
Eileen!
So, I couldn’t help but overhear you boys talking this morning. Who’s this Eileen you mentioned?
So that means-
Patience had a vision. Something’s gonna go wrong.
If we...get this “squared away”
BLACK OUT.
Yeah. Right.
have to be sorry for that.
CLAIRE
Finding Anael. She is the only one who doesn’t, well,
Cas, Cas. It’s fine, man. I’m just-
Awesome.
WAITRESS
You need to leave.
Then I suppose the collateral damage can’t be avoided.
He’ll be fine. He’d never let any of us handle it, anyways. It’s like when we were kids, he’d always be the one to talk Dad down, or pick him up from the bar when he was too drunk to walk. He was always protecting me.
John Winchester. I am aware.
You know, he’s actually gotten pretty good at it. Remember the time he tried to make me mac and cheese with marshmallows-
Nothing about the Winchesters?
It’s alright. Claire, you don’t have to have an answer right now. Or ever. Just...our door is always open.
How about you show Claire your room? I think she’d like to see your legos.
Come on, Jack. You know that’s Dean’s whole
Miss what?
Is this soda?
. Will you stay?

ANAEL
INT. THE IMPALA - NIGHT
No. No not really.
Come on, Dean. It's been weeks since the whole Empty thing, and you've barely been home for more than a day!
“Yeah don’t tell me about it, I heard it all this morning.” He poured his own cup of coffee before sitting down at the table Cass had finished setting. The younger brother didn’t miss how the Angel wandered to stand beside Dean, shoulders tense and gaze uneasy as he looked at Sam. The behavior had been happening more often lately and none of them knew why. But for whatever reason Cass was no longer comfortable with Sam and Dean being in the same room if he wasn’t with them. And even then he was starting to place himself between the two whenever possible.
“Which means we are fucked.” Sam snarled, bringing the bike to a stop. Racking his brain for a solution, he growled once again at the bracer. As long as Dean wore it Sam couldn’t see him. Cass could see him, if he wasn’t hidden behind a bush or something, but the Angel couldn’t sense him thanks to the inscriptions on their ribs, so how the hell were they going to find him this time? How was Cass supposed to find him? Cass could see him, he needed to…
Cass stroking his mate’s face gave him one final gentle kiss. “Then let’s get dressed and tell him we sorry.”
‘You are worth something, you are worth everything to me.’ He would have said more but he knew him adding on the comment that it was him who wasn’t worth anything would have Castiel blowing his top.
“I think so, but if so she is very far from home. She was helping me fight that monster, fucker injured her and she took off. We’ll find her later. So how do we hunt this bitch.” He scanned the forest around him, hoping to maybe see the monster close by. It would make it a hell of a lot easier to kill her if she was. No such luck so he contented himself with forcing his legs to carry his weight. It wasn’t easy considering his wings wanted to topple him over from their dragging weight.
A long 30 seconds later.
Still those hands in his wings…
The last thing he noticed before he succumbed to the darkness, was the sounds of a bike in the far distance.
Other bird like creatures much smaller in scale skated around them, cawing and cackling with glee as they flew around their much larger brothers. The larger flyers snapped in annoyance at the little pests, and those actually riding them as Sam watched them go by. Creatures which had their own claws dug into the back of the flying beasts as they directed them where they wanted the birds to go. A flock of nearly 100 passed him quickly as they went about their business, hunting or traveling he wasn’t sure and didn’t want to find out.
Reaching for the other bottle of syrup one loaded with the sweetness he always craved. “How can you eat pancakes without real syrup? Or even that crap but in such meager amounts. It's wrong on so many levels.”
“Yes, it could very well be the being I felt watching him.”
For hours they seemed to walk, uphill, down hill, in spirals.  They even had to climbs hundreds of steps down, only to go even more up. They never stopped walking, taking no breaks as they traveled. The only sounds to be heard was the sound of their footsteps, breathing and the clack of claw tips on stone. If it wasn’t for those minor noises it would have been intolerable for Dean. As it was he was completely blind and trusting way to much on the cat to lead him where they needed to go.
Sam watched as Dean finally settled down to take a much needed nap on the air mattress. It had been like pulling teeth to get him to do so willingly but Sam managed it. Cass wisely had stayed out of it while the brothers argued over if Dean needed it but in the end, Sam won. It helped the elder hunter finally had a full belly and was feeling the effects of it. They had brought the meat in and Dean hadn’t hesitated to start butchering it out. Starting a fire to cook it had been a bit problematic, till Naoko had rolled her eyes and simply assumed her larger form in the fire pit. The tinder had caught and soon they had a respectable fire going for cooking. Taking a few flat rocks he placed them in the fire itself to act as cast iron pans, not the best but it was all they had. Slicing off thin strips he set about cooking the meat in a manner Sam had always been in awe of. Sure he could cook meat over a fire, but Dean managed to do so with little to no seasonings handy. They had salt of course, but to find wild spices was a trick he had never mastered like Dean had.
Growling at yet another hiccup in their hunting trip. “Son of a bitch, okay look can you carry Gabe while I take care of Cass? We’ll get as close as we can and see what those fuckers are doing to my baby.”
Dropping his smile at the tone she was using. “Charlie what is happening?” He was already striding towards the garage. The halls of the bunker echoing around him as he quick timed it to where the other two were practicing.
I hope this is one that many enjoy and please leave me a comment if you did. I like reading them.
“I SAID DROP YOUR WEAPONS, GET ON YOUR KNEES, HANDS BEHIND YOUR HEAD!” She bellowed, aiming for the tallest man.
“What do you mean Dean?” The forest looked the same as so many other ones he had seen over the centuries.
Sighing he obeyed, putting more power into his down sweeps, feeling how his weight shifted, how his legs began to tense.
Dean rolled his hips gently as he worked, not trying to stimulate his mate, just continue to keep him interested enough to concentrate on everything else Dean was doing. He ducked down and kissed first one shoulder blade then another, before peppering each bump of his spine with kisses. He licked between the bones as he kissed, humming his own pleasure at how docile Cass was being, how calm. He loved how much Cass was behaving and enjoying himself, how he was pleased with Dean’s actions. Cass responded by settling deeper, his mind almost still as Dean’s relentless soft attention took root.
The lady and pretty much everyone else in the bank followed him. Kneeling down he checked on the Archangel’s belly and found it to be mostly healed. Sam wiped his forehead, feeling tired and drained for some reason but ignored it in favor of moving Gabriel to a more comfortable location. Looking up he spotted what appeared to be the bank manager. “Hey do you have an office or a couch I can move my friend here too? He needs to rest after getting hit by that thing.”
Looking at him with eyes filled with worried concern. ‘You sure? We can try something else.’ And Dean would hunt till he found something else if asked. They had those other books, maybe something in there would give them what they needed. Cass’s next words negated his thoughts though.
Hearing the softness in her friends voice, she responded in the same tone “But both keep each other grounded because they can’t stand hurting each other.” She stopped when Sam pointed to another set of bushes filled with berries they could pick. They spent some time doing so till it was stripped bare, before moving on.
“Ready Dean.” Sam stated as he stood on the other side of Gabriel’s bed.
“I’ll go back and watch Gabe, I think you need to talk to Cass about this, sooner rather then later.”
It was a nightmare and for roughly 18 hours they drove straight through, if he could have flown he would have. But he didn’t know how to yet, hadn’t managed to do much more than hover for a few minutes. Which took a hell of a lot of energy out of him, the speed of the wing beats insane. But he was getting his exercise at least, his pudge in his middle was mostly gone. Replaced with full body aches as he became used to working new muscles. Cass had been an asshole too when teaching him, not allowing him to rest till he had accomplished whatever task he had decided Dean needed to.
“No arguments there buddy. How do you want to get down there? Fly?” The hunter scanned the skies to check for storm clouds or anything else which might be dangerous. It was still overcast, the clouds dark and depressed. Rumbles of thunder mixed with a few bolts of lightening the only points of activity to be seen.
“Yes Majesty?” He asked turning to his Queen.
Bowing once more, “Thank you, is there anything else you wish to know my Queen?”
Turning back to the Commander who had thrown the Consort out like so much garbage. “Where is she? I will explain to her what true honor is, it is not acceptable to simply toss our ward.”
For now though they were walking slowly, watching the people, smelling the food which was making Dean hungry, it reminded him he needed to feed Cass too. Hunger was probably not making his Angel’s mood any better. They were interrupted in their walk by a loud group of mostly drunk frat boys who had been harassing Dean about his “Fairy” wings all day. Only Dean’s hand on Castiel’s shoulder had kept the Angel from smiting the bastards. Instead Dean had punched the one of the guys and moved on.
“Fine, so what happened?”
Sam yawned as he slowly woke up, blinking his eyes to focus them for the first time that day. The sight before him was the still form of the Archangel, still sleeping heavily on his bed. From the looks of it he hadn’t moved since he had been placed in it the day before. Sighing he sat up, running his hands through his hair as he tried to get his mind started. It was harder than he anticipated, confusion, discomfort, the feeling of being pulled in multiple directions assailed him. Rubbing his face he tried to make sense of what he was feeling, it was weird, stressful and as he sat there realized it wasn’t coming from him. Looking up he stared at Gabe for a long time, feeling spikes and pinches flashing within him. Whatever was happening to the Archangel it was growing and affecting those around him. Which couldn’t be good for him or anyone else in the long run. They really needed to hit the books today and try and determine just what the hell was going on with him.
With screams of glee and hatred the trolls charged.
“No.” He wouldn’t give in, he wouldn’t give in, he wouldn’t give in.
“Just do it damn it.” Cass narrowed his eyes, lust forgotten as he wished to experience a new milestone in Dean’s life. He wanted to see if Dean could fly. But he didn’t want to tell him either what he was up to, in case the elder Winchester just stopped. He knew Dean didn’t like to fly, he wasn’t sure how the man would react, if he knew he was reaching flight speed.
He was almost asleep when Cas returned, so he just grunted noncommittedly as a greeting. Sleep seemed more important than anything. Until a bag of freaking ice was dropped on his knuckle. His eyes flew open, and he starred down at the offending item. His boyfriend gave him an amused glance as he placed an ice bag on his other knuckle as well. Okay, they weren’t actually ice bags. When Dean looked closer, he saw they it was frozen peas partly packed into a dish towel. That didn’t change the fact that they
“Let’s try this one more time,” Castiel said sternly. “You are
“It’s not like anyone else is going to see you this way. Right Dean?”
He simply nuzzled closer to the other in answer, letting out a pleased moan as his lips were captured in yet another deep kiss. They stayed like that for a long time, just kissing and breathing each other in. Then Castiel pulled back, and gently removed the blindfold. Dean blinked rapidly in the dim light of the room. For a few moments his eyes locked with the piercing blue ones of his Dom, before he lowered his gaze towards the ground.
“Touch yourself again.”
“Fuck if I know.”
“I guess not.” It certainly had seemed like he’d changed his plans. Dean really should have known better. When Cas first made up his mind, he stuck to it. He peered down at his stomach, seeing
“Dean,” Cas sighed. “You need to take better care of yourself.”

“Dean. Look at me.” Cas laid a hand on his cheek and starred intently at him as their eyes met. “Indulge me in this. Let me show you affection. You

"Shhh. Relax sweet boy I'm here." The voice said from right beside him while a comforting hand settled in his hair. "I was only getting a toy is all. Something to help you keep still. Though you are doing remarkably well on your own today."
“Cas?”
Standing was an effort, his muscles complaining after a long day doing construction, and a long evening snapping and screaming at his boyfriend. Rolling his shoulder lightly, he heard the increasingly familiar cracking sound. Then he walked to the bathroom and undressed quickly. His clothes fell to the floor, a good foot or two away from the laundry hamper. He’d fix that later. Maybe.
“Come for me Dean.”
That was if there even were any them to care about the closet after this fight. It wasn’t the first time either of them had run out after a fight. In fact, that particular maneuver was becoming one of Cas’ specialties. Even so, there seemed to be a finality to the way he left this evening. As if Dean had finally crossed that line he had been tiptoeing for months. Perhaps for their entire relationship. Was this is it? Had he managed to push Cas away? That was perfectly in character for him. This was what he always did. Whenever things seemed settled and good, he always found new ways to ruin it. Ruining the good things, especially the relationships, in his life was one of his most developed talents.

“Stop. Now.”
“Now continue touching yourself.”
The first splash of water on his back was freezing, but he just took a breath, adjusted the temperature a bit, and waited for it to warm up. Soon it was on the edge of too hot, slowly turning his skin red while it eased his sore muscles. He hurriedly shampooed his hair and washed his body, then stood under the water stream as the soap rinsed off. While his body finally relaxed, his mind wandered back to the earlier fight and some of Cas’ final words.
Dean grinned happily and fell back into the pillows, accepting the chaste kiss to his forehead with a low hum. Hopefully Cas would bring back one of the cookies they had baked with Jack the day before. That would be the perfect bedtime snack.
"Let's see how your training is coming along," the older man stated, tightening his grip even further. "Remember: breath through your nose and just relax. You have managed this before."
