Dean laughs, shakes his head ruefully and turns off the gas lest something else catch fire. Speaking of which, when he’s done being bullied by Cas, he needs to check the fire alarm because that definitely should have gone off by now.
He hears rattling coming from Cas’s room, goes over to investigate. He’s asleep, or he’s got his eyes closed at least, but he’s writhing.
“Maybe you aughta slow down.” Is the reply, but it’s said teasingly, not nagging. Claire can deal with that. And hey, she wanted a distraction. It’s almost as if God is actually listening and isn’t some shitlord deadbeat bastard who’s either long absent or very much here and intent on ruining her life.
Dean gives him a gentle little smile, and then a teasing wink, diffusing the charged moment with a joke.
“If you’d rather do this by yourself, I can leave.” Cas says, turning around, and Dean stops with a groan.
He looks around the room, clocks Charlie for the first time and starts, apparently loses all brain to mouth filter in his surprise.
“Just because you’re recovering doesn’t mean you can escape all the chores. There’ll be some bags you can carry.” She winks.
He needs a coffee, or a fucking Adderall, just something to reign in those goddamn errant thoughts and let him focus.
“So.” Dean says slowly. “All those revelations, flipping from we’re all doomed to miraculous get out clause—”
He sneaks into one of the old, abandoned bathrooms, where he’s least likely to be disturbed. He slips out of his jeans and shirt, runs the water cold. He’s had enough of heat for now.
There’s no dinner put on tonight, so as it starts to push mid evening and Sam isn’t back, Dean and Cas realise that one or both of them is going to have to get up and cook. They don’t feel quite as bad as they did this morning, but they also aren’t up to doing anything that isn’t lying down quietly and not doing much.
Actually, that’s a point. Antibiotics aren’t the only thing they have an alarming supply of. The shit the Men of Letters left behind is enough to sedate a small hospital. Sam has no idea what the expiration date on a crate of morphine is, but he imagines it’s a good idea to lock it away from the person with the shiny new opiate addiction.
“Whatever that thing is, it’s insulating you from the more everyday effects of the Mark of Cain. Which, as you can tell, the Mark isn’t happy about.”
Dean can’t sleep. Cas is curled around him, breath steady and calm against his side, but it’s a source of distress rather than comfort. It’s the guilt; it always comes back to the guilt. Guilt that Cas probably doesn’t quite understand what Dean’s asking him to do isn’t something friends usually do. But that’s just low level. That’s a broken glass verses a broken neck, in the grand, guilty scheme of things.
He smiles, even though it hurts his face, even though he’s still a fucking wreck inside. He spent years being all front while his insides fell apart. He can pull it off one more time.
She’s not sure it’s doing Dean quite as much good. His face is contorted in a snarl and he’s muttering something under his breath, only stopping to slug from his bottle of Jack – a fresh one, even though he said he was running out.
They bicker back and forth good naturedly, trying to ignore the wildly inappropriate noises that Sam is making around his lettuce, until their entrees arrive.
Sam hands over the sheet, covered in his untidy scrawl. Druiel glances at the list of names, nods gravely.
Cas wakes up without a sense of foreboding, for once. It makes him instantly suspicious, doubly so when he sits up and looks around, realises that Dean isn’t in the room with him. With a sigh he heaves himself out of bed and goes in search.
He got Cas back, he’s here in the bunker with him and Sam and Charlie and they’re watching shit TV and teasing each other and eating home cooked food and doing all the shit on Dean’s checkbox of domestic fucking bliss.
Dean’s own cock bobs heavy between his legs, but he can ignore it for now. He’s got more important things to focus on. He pulls off Cas a little, so the swollen head of his cock is resting on his tongue. He goes to town on it, earning a yell from Cas that comes with a just the right side of painful tug on his hair.
Sam is walking past Cas’s room, on his way to get morning coffee and make Cas some breakfast, when he hears his name being called.
But he doesn’t have time so he just splashes some water on his face to get rid of the salt stains, returns to the bedroom and packs up his things.
Focus on the clothes, on Sam’s expression as he picks up a particularly improbably heeled shoe, on Dean’s snort of laughter as he picks out the ugliest thing he can find and brings it over.
Cas flinches violently in his grip, pulls out of it and stumbles forwards, falling onto the floor. He backs away into the sink, hisses as he jams his back into it but doesn’t move, one hand raised to ward Sam off, eyes wild and terrified.
“He’d just have” Cas clicks his fingers, “bye stubborn asshole Dean, hello placid lobotomised Dean.”
He licks slowly over Cas’s hole, teases him, getting closer and closer until he finally points his tongue and pushes the tip inside. Cas groans and rolls his hips back, trying to push Dean deeper, chase the sensation, just get
But they’re not really there for Cas. Cas who can barely make it through a few hours at a time without being reminded what happened to him. Cas who catalogues days by the nagging want in his gut, the twitching of his limbs and the wastage of his body. Cas doesn’t need a reminder, and if he did, it wouldn’t be carved somewhere he couldn’t see it.
He steels himself to approach his and Cas’s room, and somehow ends up in the kitchen instead. He doesn’t want to disturb Cas’s sleep he tells himself.
“The spell, it won’t just jolt your stamina back up to normal. It’ll accelerate all of your healing, won’t it.”
“Dude. If this hunt takes weeks I am taking off out of there. No way I can be cooped up with that many hunters for that long and not kill at least one.”
doing it; don’t get him wrong, he just doesn’t really get anything out of it himself – not like all the other parts of going down on someone. The taste of them, getting deep in their clit or their ass or whatever, feeling the weight and the shape of a cock on his tongue and the bitter tang of precome to let him know he’s doing a good job. Deepthroating, well, it’s mostly just trying really hard to suppress his gag reflex while he does his best to get off on the happy noises his partner is making. Which, admittedly, he is very good at. Other people being happy makes him happy. Especially if that other person is Cas.
Crowley has no idea what to say to that. He knew Dean hated himself, he didn’t realise it was quite this much.
And okay, some of the stress isn’t actually Dean and Cas’s fault. It’s things outside of their control, fading grace, hellish nightmares and demonic marks. Some of it is still theirs though – pigheaded stubbornness, fucking idiocy, having the emotional maturity of a battered fish. Y’know. The usual Dean and Cas bullshit.
Emotionally there’s no question of Cas going back with them. Not yet. He has a course and he’s set on it. He’s not going back to the bunker to be pitied by one resident – simultaneously loved and despised by the other.
Cas comes back into the room and sees Dean and Alice flirting relentlessly. Fingers brushing, laughing, body language keyed in time, swaying and mirroring each other.
He moves quietly into the living room, sees Dean and Cas still on the same sofa he left them on. Cas is lying awkwardly on Dean’s chest, Dean has his arms wrapped around him, appears to be fucking smiling in his sleep.
The kid doesn’t say anything to that, but he doesn’t shy away any more either. Dean takes that as some kind of approval. He comes slowly forward, starts to tend to the kid’s leg.
“I am, but I dunno. Kinda makes it worse. Spend all your time with a dude, kinda feels like you’re missing a limb when he ups and offs.”
It’s going to take a lot of work to make the Continental gleam again, Dean thinks, as he looks at the burned and twisted wreckage.
“I knocked him out the human way.” Cahor smiles, relishing the memory. “It was immensely satisfying – so very tempting to just keep going.”
“Excellent choice. And y’know, you idiot, when I said I was there for you – for stuff you can’t go to Sam and Dean for. I didn’t just mean the touchy feely emotional stuff. I meant anything. Changing your dressings, putting cling-film on the toilet ‘cause Dean’s pissing you off, even manipulating Sam into buying junk food. There are some things you can’t go to your boyfriend, or his brother for. Sometimes you need a friend, dude. And I’m around for that.”
Cas hums again, a little contented noise, plucks the finished crane from Dean’s hands and examines it.
“Um, maybe not right now.” He doesn’t know where the nearest is, but he doesn’t think it’s close. The thought of having to drive any great distance is making him twitchy already. Plus once they get there they’d sit in a queue of cars, not much scope for making a quick—
Dean’s eyes flicker open and Cas sees black in the right one, can’t tell if it’s because of the shadowy glow or something more sinister. Time seems to freeze momentarily, and then Dean’s on his feet, screaming, snarling, furious. He throws Cas to the side, but there’s no demonic power behind it so Cas stays his ground. Dean howls again in frustration, getting right up in Cas’s face and Cas sees with relief that it’s just a burst blood vessel in his eye. Not great news in the scheme of things but better than demon black.
“If you’d done it somewhere else we might not have found you. Shit, man. That’s not why I’m  up– I’m not upset. Well, no. I am upset.”
A week goes by, and he doesn’t get any less tense. As the demon who turned hell into an eternal queue, it’s the kind of torture he can appreciate. No horror can be as great as that which the imagination inflicts, no pain is as terrifying as the one you think up for yourself in anticipation.
“Shit, Cas.” He heaves out between rasping breaths, “I’ll make it up to you, yeah, when I get back, when I’ve made sure you’re safe.”
Rage-triumph-joy-confusion-horror-fear. And then, as Lucifer takes hold of the poor, loyal demon and wrenches her out of her meatsuit, that kind of dawning, sinking realisation.
Dean wakes the next morning to a raging hangover, pretty standard, and to a ringing phone. Less standard. He stumbles out of bed and to the motel kitchen, rips open a packet of rehydration salts, adds it to a glass of water and stirs. He chugs that down, and then grabs his phone from beside the bed.
“See, even if I believed you were real, this sloppy sort of shit is all the proof I need. The real Benny? He’d have run a fucking mile.” Dean’s gaze slips away from Benny and to the sky behind him and he sneers bitterly. “Too fucking lazy to even raid my memories properly now? Half-assing it?”
The sort of boredom that is dangerous for normal people, never mind the people for whom boredom is the most dangerous thing, their worst enemy. Recovering addicts.
Cas will be fine. He has to be. He always is. He’s not dead this time. It’s a vast improvement, really. A near death experience is better than an actual death one, probably.
Interestingly enough, the frown is directed at Dean’s phone, which he literally just said Cas’s texts are no longer visible on. So ether Sam’s found his stash of gay porn – he’s seen enough of Dean’s straight porn that he wouldn’t pull that face, although really the guy on guy stuff shouldn’t be a surprise, recently-kind-of-out-bisexual hello! Maybe Sam found the amateur shots he did with Cas – I mean, seeing your friend with his tongue in your brother’s ass and vice-versa, gotta you freak out a little bit.
He finds Sam, dishevelled and clearly just woken from the commotion, coming out of his room. He slams him up against the wall, taking some satisfaction in the shock and tinge of fear the action brings.
”That explains the headache.” Dean scowls at her, making a line for the kitchen and some motherfucking coffee.
sneak into the bunker, except that she definitely fucking does. The last thing she wants is for someone to warn Dean that she’s here so that he can fuck off and hide somewhere else.
“It’s been a while since you had a shower, and I can’t imagine that feels great. So, I was thinking you could do that. If you promise to be good.”
Dean’s saved from having to think up a reply by Sam, coming stumbling out of his room, followed by Ash.
He’s thought about this, after his little meltdown over the fake beer. About the different levels of failure he’s going to allow himself without too much in the way of castigation. He’s a fuckup, he knows it, so he’s gotta have some leeway. Can’t take the first slip as an excuse to dive face-first into even worse because fuck it, we’ve already failed now, what’s the point in carrying on.
He gives a few playful tugs on Cas’s cock when he pulls off, enough to get him really worked up and desperate, but not enough to provide any satisfaction. See, Dean understands the joys of anticipation, of drawing it out as long as possible.
He wonders how it works. Did everyone come back at once – in which case, where the fuck did Cas end up? Or are they coming back in waves – humans first then animals, monsters, other? Where on that sliding scale do angels even sit?
He prefers to do this alone, not because he’s ashamed of his own paranoia, necessarily, but more because he doesn’t want to remind Cas that the angel who tried to kill him is living and breathing a few metres away from him. But more than that – because lets face it, there’s no way Cas can forget that the reason he’s a shaky fucked up mess is so close by – Dean especially doesn’t want Cas to think he has even the smallest of doubts about the ability of their wards to hold the bastard.
And then the cruel, rational part of his mind reminds him who it really is, and of course with that comes the dull, nagging ache.
Dean, in a move that surprises literally no-one, spends the entire flight in the bathroom, throwing up. No amount of luxury can make up for the fact that they are
“Why would it want you?” Sam asks, not meaning to sound as dismissive of Cas as he perhaps comes across.
“This is absolute garbage.” Dean says, for what is neither the first, third, or even fifth time as they attempt to trudge their way through an episode of some bottom of the barrel Netflix documentary.
“Correct, my friend. So this is the bunker,” she points to a great big red x, just for idiotproofing purposes, “and these are the three locations.” She indicates three circles. One pretty close by, but the others much more considerable of a walk away. “I’m pretty sure these are accurate – you would not believe the ballache I had trying to work it out. Either the Men of Letters were not a fan of GPS co-ordinates or they just assumed it’d be so obvious why bother writing it down. I had to spend an hour fucking about with maps and light tables.”
The cruel, patronising tone ignites something in Cas, some last reserve of anger that he’d been tamping down and fighting to keep under control.
He laughs, a hysterical burst, and then again and again until it makes him dizzy and he has to sit down. He has his wings back. Now if only he could fly.
He looks around furtively. Sam mustn’t have noticed it, he’d never have left it if he did. Or, or maybe he did, maybe it’s there deliberately, a trust trap.
“Did you know that some people become addicted from the first shot? Maybe Castiel was one of those people, but we’ll never know. It’s my fault, really – he just looked so blissful that it felt cruel to allow him to come back from that. So I gave him some more, and some more, and some more.
And then he starts to move. He starts slow as always, but he builds up far quicker than he usually would until he’s pounding up and down.
“Firstly, it’s a risk I am prepared to take, and secondly, it’s less risk than allowing this thing to go unchecked. We don’t know what it is, we don’t know what it wants. It might be changing you into something worse than a demon – in which case I am in danger anyway.”
Dean throws together a pretty impressive breakfast, if he does say so himself. Pancakes, bacon, fresh fruit, yoghurt, bread and honey. A fucking feast.
Dean sputters, forces out something that isn’t a sentence by any stretch of the imagination. Lucifer understands what he’s trying to get across, but just barely. He better not be like this for the entire conversation. It’s tiring enough talking to Dean when he’s capable of using words, this inarticulate half babble is going to
It takes Dean a moment to catch on to why Charlie’s looking at him with that kind of resigned worry. He’s attributing Cas’s bleariness to the confusion of just having woken up from a nightmare, nothing more or less sinister than that. But then the panic doesn’t clear and he gets it – Cas doesn’t feel confused at all. He had no idea he was dreaming.
Unfortunately, Sam is ready and heading off within moments of getting up, while Dean estimates he still needs about 20 minutes before the caffeine kicks in and he becomes a real life human being. Luckily he planned for that and went to bed dressed in all but his boots and his oh so subtle baseball cap of facial concealment. Unluckily, he is not yet possessed of the manual dexterity to deal with things like laces.
He doesn’t confront Buck now. This is not the time, but there will be a reckoning. He does keep a careful eye on him, though, watching his back against hunters as well as monsters.
Cas sits up with a wince that makes Dean wonder if he sprained something in his sleep. Maybe this sofa-bed thing isn’t good for him. It looks solid enough, but it’s not a real mattress. Might not be doing him any favours.
Dean needs the smoking gun, something definite. Which is fine, if there is a gun to find. But what if there’s not? How long can he justify this sneaking around, stalking Sam.
“No, I don’t know. What do you find so uncomfortable about watching animals hunt down their prey, tear into the still living flesh—”
Cas asks in spite of himself. He expected sudden violence, angelic style retribution. He doesn’t know what he’s about to witness anymore.
The woman waves her apology away with a tired, not quite sincere smile. She’s working the dog shift, she gets this shit all the time and she doesn’t have the energy to care.
Cas is usually pretty rough when he takes the lead, all focussed intensity and carefully controlled power, but this is something else. He’s almost feral, thrusting up into Dean ferociously. Dean has no leverage of his own, speared on Cas’s cock and pounded against the door. He can’t even touch himself, the one time he tries, half-heartedly at best it must be said, Cas slaps his hand away with a grunt, returns his grip to Dean’s ass and squeezes bruisingly.
Dean grunts at the slight burn, adjusts his angle a little to allow Cas easier access, and bites at his collarbones, determined to leave some marks. Cas starts to works him open, not touching his prostate once, and Dean’s nearly gagging now, desperate for stimulation.
Dean doesn’t dream that night. He wakes up, refreshed but nervous. The first thing he does is check his hands, still unable to shake the nagging feeling that there’s something wrong with them. Cas notices, takes hold of them tenderly, lifts one up to his lips and kisses it.
Not casual calm – slightly tired and a little tense, but not gibbering wreck territory by any means.
“You had other problems.” Cas points out, entirely too understandingly. “Between the Mark and the forest itself. I’ll forgive you for being distracted this time.”
If something like that is happening, something really big, and really bad, that means one of two things. Either whatever has been dragging Dean into this nightmare forest has climbed out through him, torn him apart, heaved itself through his blackened, twisted flesh and scorched, splintered bone. Or it’s dancing him around like a marionette, fingers dug into his nerves and pinching at them, twitching and jerking him around.
Might that can, and has been, used to pick Dean up and fuck him against walls. He shivers at the thought, the sense memory.
Dean huffs out a little laugh at Cas’s unconvinced tone. “Maybe just like as a trial, carry it around and if you get the urge to gouge clean through your hand, do it to that thing instead?”
“I’ll be fine, I wanted to make sure you were, too.” Cas finally takes his hands off Dean’s face, turns and makes his way to the car.
Dean drinks all the way through dinner preparations. It’s not healthy, but he needs something, some kind of crutch. The way Sam is looking at him is making his skin crawl. He’d followed Dean to the kitchen and set up with a book, ostensibly to do research or something, but Dean can’t shake the feeling that he’s having an eye kept on him. He keeps looking up with this expression, and Dean can’t really pin it, but if he had to he’d call it suspicious. Like Sam thinks he’s hiding something.
Eventually he gives up and reads the plaque. It doesn’t say what it’s called; only that some dude or company or whatever named McDonnell Douglas donated it, and that it was used to make the fuselages for small planes. Well, he was kinda right. Ish.
Sam does a good job, keeps it in for the entire journey. Okay, maybe he takes it out on the car’s suspension a little bit, but Dean keeps his mouth shut, doesn’t complain.
“Yeah. Because so far we’ve been erring on the side of fucking caution. What’re you gonna do, try and carve it off with a knife?”
“Because it’s like prude baggy grandma knickers and a bra, and the game is set in a nuclear wasteland.”
For once, Cas doesn’t insist that he’s well enough to join in the physical activities. He picks up the instruction booklet and takes almost worrying delight in ordering everyone around.
“Is it possible that he left for another reason? That he got, what’s the human expression, cold feet?”
Cas isn’t sure he wants to know, but then again, his capacity for absorbing horrible things without being broken by them has been expanding greatly in recent weeks. He just watched Lucifer slit a girl’s wrists and summon a demon into her convulsing body, and he only screamed for it to stop once before he gave up and accepted that he would have to watch it happen.
slaughtered all these angels and then fucked off, without a word to either of us, without so much as a fucking text or a phone call?” Anger he can do. Anger is better than fear.
Cas is having a really good dream. He won’t remember any of it when he wakes up, just that he felt safe, happy. Free from worry. That something about it just felt right.
“Because no angel would risk killing another with holy oil. It’s too volatile, too easy to get the smallest splash on yourself, and go up with the blaze.”
They also, apparently, drag out self-indulgently maudlin tendencies you thought you’d left behind you, Cas admonishes himself. The apocalypse was a long time ago, and he honestly assumed by now he’d be better equipped to deal with the surges and slumps of human emotion and suffering. That he wouldn’t still be stuck on the Bukowski - as Dean refered to it - method of coping with his mortal existence. But, like a lot of things, that was before, and now he’s not sure whether he’s still here because he wants to be, or because it’d probably hurt more to just lie down and accept his fate than it would to keep shuffling onwards.
He has control of his body again, somehow. He doesn’t know how for sure, but he has a vague inkling that he actually has the panic attack to thank for it, that in torturing Castiel, Lucifer created his own undoing.
“It has a possible positive side effect.” Cas begins, but Dean knows where he’s going, heads him off.
Dean Winchester, Cas thinks with a sad little smile. Always the first to shoulder the blame and share the praise.
“Shit.” Sam scrubs a hand through his hair. “Is that going to happen every time he leaves the bunker?”
The next few hundred miles are tense, but if there’s one thing that’s guaranteed to stand Dean down, it’s the open road. Gradually his grip on the wheel loosens, his shoulders unclench.
. Something magical. An electric crackle of something that’s familiar enough to recognise, but not enough to place.
It’s a good job a bitter tone can’t kill, because damn, Lucifer would be a set of wings charcoaled on the ground.
“No, he only wants you to think that.” Charlie says, with a great sweeping hand gesture and narrowed eyes.
Dean has a black eye starting to show and he can feel some bruising along his ribs; Sam is walking with a slight limp and favouring his left hand, but Cas took the brunt. There are livid strangulation marks around his neck, his nose is possibly broken, his knuckles are all but stripped of skin, his chest and arms are covered with cuts and bruises of varying sizes, and his knee is fucked.
“No, no. Man, that’s not what I meant. I’m being an ass, I’m sorry. You deserve to have clothes that fit, Cas, I didn’t mean it like that.”
“I’m sorry for what I said, Dean. I didn’t mean it I was just...” He trails off, able to grasp the word he wants but somehow not able to force it past his teeth.
“You’re gonna take this phone, carry on to the bar as if nothing fucking happened. I don’t give a shit how you get there. Just go. They’re tracking us somehow, I assume it’s this. Or you.”
Charlie drives an angel blade into his back with a tight grimace. Sacrifice one so three don’t have to die. It fucking sucks, but it’s all she’s got right now.
Cas works him like that for a while, and then grabs the lube, slathers it on his fingers, slips one in and starts stretching Dean out. He’s rewarded with a low, rumbling moan and a renewed grinding motion from Dean.
Dean snorts. “Sounds like me, but, ah. Not quite. You said you didn’t want to know about what I did under the mark, unless I wanted to tell you.”
hangs in the air between them. Cas mulls over whether to take offence and abandon the entire charade, decides no, might as well carry on.
Also also, my gmail has apparently been doing something weird with my emails and I haven't seen a single one from AO3 about comments for ages, but have now realised I do have them I AM VERY SORRY for ignoring you, and I am going to try and respond to them all as soon as I can.
“Sounds nice and all, but if the dude’s omnipresent, that means he could still stick around here and help you guys out too.”
Sam has to concede that. The bunker is fucking freezing. Brilliant water pressure, shame the magic doesn’t extend to the radiators.
Instead he’s stark naked and getting pounded against a door, covered in saliva and other bodily fluids, and possibly fucking sawdust.
It’s been hard enough keeping check of himself in the day time, when he’s in full control of his body. The amount of times he caught himself unconsciously reaching for Cas. He’s having to unlearn the instinct that tells him to touch Cas — because he wants to reassure him or just because he can, because they’re both there. Turns out that doesn’t just vanish at night when you’re sharing a bed with someone, and your idiot monkey brain just wants to hold them tight in case they up and vanish from you again.
Dean knew he’d been knocked around a little, knew he had aches and pains and injuries – but he thought most of them were superficial, that Cas’s physical torment came from his withdrawal. Figured someone would have fucking told him if Cas was butchered halfway to hell and back.
The atmosphere does a strange flip. Both Cas and Charlie have some tension between themselves and Dean. Unresolved argument and accusations running from Charlie to Dean, from Dean to Cas.
Dean throws himself to the side, lands on firm ground and flinches as another noise joins the din. Something howls out from the wound in the earth, screams with such rage and fury and hatred that Dean’s eardrum’s strain under the sound, give way with a muted pop. And now there really is silence.
Like Lucifer is going to say no to that. He makes the appropriate noise, allows Dean to drag him to the bed and push him down.
And if he was feeling boring and uncreative, he’d take Dean’s hands in his, wind their fingers together and watch the confusion spread across his pretty little face as Lucifer’s grip started to tighten. He’d savour the delicious screams as he crushed the bones in Dean’s hand, obliterated beyond the healing powers of anything but an archangel.
Douche-Benny manages to get a grip on his arm. Cas slashes out at him with the angel blade, but then finds his hand being gripped tight, knuckles pressed until he lets go and his weapon falls to the floor. The vampire grins toothily, fangs slipping out in excitement.
Dean drops his head to Cas’s shoulder. “You nearly gave me a fucking heart attack, you ass.” He says, but with no real heat.
He pauses, but Cas is silent on the other end of the line. Dean doesn’t even fucking now if he’s still there, but he plows on regardless.
“We all deal with our traumas in different ways, Samuel. I’m dealing with my probably very imminent death by finding it amusing. Gallows humour, sweetheart.”
“I thought you were dead! You’re supposed to give up on people when they’re dead. You grieve and you pick up and you get on with your life. You don’t try and bring them back at any fucking cost.”
Instead he’s met with silence. He potters around, deliberately loud, opens cupboards and chucks around pots and pans as he rustles up ingredients for dinner.
Understanding hits Dean like a sledgehammer to the face. Does about as much damage, too. That Cas thinks Dean has that low an opinion of him. It hadn’t even crossed his mind to be suspicious of Cas. He never fucking would, never.
Sam nods. Of course Dean wouldn’t bother to show Cas the gym. He’s spent a grand total of about 15 minutes in there the entire time he’s lived in the bunker — and he’s never bothered to investigate any of the rooms leading off from it.
There’s a brief noise of triumph from above, and then blinding light fills the warehouse as Dean rips off a large section of the corrugated roof. Cas darts forward to where he can see the tangle of vampires curled up to sleep – all now groggily awake and day blinded, burning.
He pops his head around the door, hoping that if he doesn’t fully enter the room, that’ll somehow make whatever Cas wants to say to him better.
“I was just about to drop her off at school. She’s going on a week long trip. And I’ve checked, it’s a real one this time.”
He can almost feel the scepticism radiating off Dean, and yeah. Okay, he obviously gave up a bit too easily there to be believed.
Cas doesn’t say anything, just grins back at Dean. That fluttering little feeling of happiness is starting up in his chest again, and he doesn’t have the strength to squash it this time, even with the voice in his head whispering:
Dean makes the forty minute drive in half that, probably picks up a dozen speeding tickets on the way but he’ll be fucked if he cares about that. He’s way too busy picturing all the things that could be happening to Cas right now.
Dean rolls the jeep to a gentle stop, mindful now that he knows Cas finds jolting rides uncomfortable.
For once Lucifer finds Cas’s head full of pop culture junk useful, instead of a cluttered nightmare. He trawls it for tenderness, soft kisses and delicate touches of the kind that neither he nor Cas have much experience with.
Of course, ‘feather’ is a ridiculously simplistic way of describing what he’s about to create. Cas drags the nail of his index finger softly up and down his arm, concentrates and slowly draws the finger away from the skin. Behind it pulls a stringy trail of grace, drawing up and away from his arm but still attached. He tugs it up until the trail is about 5 inches in length, and then he severs it – cuts it off entirely, both from his own body and from the angelic host. Without a connection to heaven there is nothing to keep it fluid, and it solidifies instantly, adopting, he supposes, a shape that could be said to resemble a feather.
And then the fucker turns, like he’s about to leave. Dean lunges forwards grabs his arm and swings him around. A flash of something crosses Cas’s face there – almost rage. Dean chalks it up to anger at having his grand exit interrupted, and yeah. Seems about right. He’d rather Cas was pissed off at him than upset anyway. Anger he can handle, but that look. Not again.
There are two coffee mugs, abandoned on the table. Both still full, both steaming. Foreboding pricks at him again. There’s something wrong about this picture. Who was here, and why did they leave in a hurry?
“S’up.” Dean goes for cheery, because fuck it, maybe whatever Sam’s angry about has nothing to do with him. Yeah, right.
“Cas, buddy.” Dean sounds nearly as wrecked as Cas feels, but it doesn’t give him any satisfaction. He knows that, knew that. He tried to punish him anyway, though, just in case. “Can – can I touch you; would that help?”
Dean’s actually thought about this pretty carefully, ‘cause Cas has never been shit hot with a gun anyway – well, not compared to Sam or Dean who were practically raised with them. In a straightforward shooting contest he’s not going to come out on top unless he cheats (which lets face it, he’s not above doing, the little shit.) And all of that’s before you throw in added complications like muscle wastage, and oops sometimes my arm spasms and the bullet goes winging off into the distance.
But they’re not in a dream. They’re in a real place, and Dean is the only bridge home. There’ll be no angelic respite this time. If Dean kills himself, or if he dies, the bond tethering Cas to him will be cut and Cas will be stuck here.
Cas confirms with a glance and drops him to the floor. Benny huffs a long-suffering sigh, picks himself up and dusts himself off.
“What, you want me to lie to you? You’ve been doing enough of that for yourself, Dean. Look, you fucked up, yeah, but we can fix it. Doesn’t make it fine, but it makes it okay.”
“What the fuck were you thinking?” He snarls at Dean, and that’s good. Dean knows how to use other people’s rage. He’s been fuelling off it, dragging it deep and internalising it for years.
“Because you can’t do it without this,” she writes down something in curving Enochian script on a piece of paper, “and it is not something I could share over any form of wavelength communication. It would have drawn attention to our conversation, and thus to the fact that Castiel was missing.”
“FUCK!” He punches the wall of the shower hard enough that he’s gonna feel it later, but that’s fine, more than goddamn fine actually. Yeah it would’ve been nice to have Cas actually there, but this is a decent second. A very decent second.
“Dude, I wouldn’t break up with you like that. ‘Specially not while you’re all banged up from defending my honor.”
“Relax. I know whatever you’ve done to Sirael is binding, and Hell always honours its debts. I just came to see what you were up to.”
“I saw Sam with a girl.” Dean blurts out. Cas waits for Dean to continue, obviously able to sense that this isn’t the whole of the problem. “He snuck out to meet her, properly sneaky, ass o’clock in the morning.”
There’s a pause. “Ben wanted a puppy.” Dean says, in a flat tone that says ask me about this and I’ll rearrange your face. “One of his friends fostered service dog puppies.”
“Nuh-uh. No way. Last time I dared cook something in that fucking kitchen I had to deal with two weeks of Mr Passive Aggressive loudly moving plates and complaining about out of place pans.”
this. Being human is torture.” Cas snarls out, shaking with what Dean figures is rage. His mouth opens and shuts and it’s clear he’s struggling to say something else, or to swallow it down. Dean isn’t sure which, until he sees the tears streaming down Cas’s face and he knows they haven’t got shit to do with the onions he was cutting.
“Museums aren’t rubbish.” Cas says, absentmindedly tracing patterns on the window of the car, drawing the scenery with his finger as it goes past.
“Oh yeah? So even if Zach had rebuilt me I’d still have hated his guts? And all this time I was counting my lucky stars and thinking there but for the grace of god.”
Cas shrugs, grinning like the little shit he is. Dean shoves at him and he overbalances. Dean laughs, until he realises that Cas has his shirt in hand and is holding it threateningly over a patch of mud on the ground.
Dean interrupts, all indignant confusion and hurt. Lucifer can practically smell the self-loathing coming off him in waves. He doesn’t even know what’s going on, but he does know that somehow it’s his fault. Everything is always his fault. Tedious.
And then, the little fucker, it rallies up the big guns. Maybe it’d been weak, maybe it’d been dormant up to now. Maybe it’d just been saving itself up, building up to this moment. Whatever the case, it seizes its opportunity. A perfect storm of rage and misery and alcohol.
He’s going to have to deal with his headache the old fashioned way, flood his pain receptors with endorphins, kill two birds with one stone, as it were.
Sam grins, wide and excited. Cas’s lack of progress had been worrying him, he’d be lying if he said otherwise. Between the refusing to resort to magic, and the slacking off with his exercises the general impression Sam has been getting is one of someone wallowing in his suffering and reluctant to move past it.
“Not what you were saying earlier.” Dean wants to believe him, but less than a half hour ago he had a very different story. He was offering to fucking
“Have either of you guys seen Sam?” Charlie’s first words when she returns, freshly showered and cleaned of all food related gunk. Cas shakes his head, Dean grunts something negative, too intent on not letting his sackperson die to respond properly.
“Never mind.” Naomi tuts, settles the metal crown on his head once again. “We’ll get it eventually.”
How is one man louder than a million, billion Satanists? How is this not driving you insane?” He pauses. “Oh, wait, you said yes to me – maybe it already did.” He snickers.
“Please.” He gasps, as Cas bites down on his shoulder, hard enough that he’s going to leave a mark. Cas rubs his cheek, scratchy with new stubble, over the bite-mark, pulls his fingers out and then pushes Dean down onto the bed. Dean moans again, closes his eyes and waits for Cas to carry on prepping him. He could probably take a cock right now, but it wouldn’t be comfortable, not unless it was the size of a fucking pencil.
“Look, I need Dean to look at the filtration system and the pipes and all that other stuff. He doesn’t have to see you in the pool ever, he just has to fix it up. We can tell him it’s for me if you really want.”
It’s like if someone came up to him after Jess, tried to persuade him she hadn’t died after all, that she’d fucking betrayed him and fucked off instead.
They look mortifyingly, embarrassingly cute, and if Sam wasn’t busy not reading his book and worrying that either his brother or his friend or fucking both is/are about to die for real, maybe he’d go get a camera and take some pictures for epic blackmail material.
He looks at Dean sort of dazedly for a moment, an expression that Dean has seen so many times but still makes him sort of uncomfortable. Adoration, pure and simple. And it’s nice, for Dean especially, as self-loathing and doubting as he can be, but it’s also kind of intimidating. How do you live up to that, how do you be the person who fucking deserves that look?
Dean looks across at Cas, sitting on a chair because he’s too tired to stand and wheezing slightly when he breathes, down at the kitchen knife in his own hand, and then disbelievingly back at Charlie.
“You were acting weird, groaning and thrashing around. I didn’t want you to accidentally hurt him. That’s why I locked your door, too. In case you started sleep walking or something, blasting things by accident. Can’t be too careful, with everything.”
Apparently over his fear of imminent death, he gives her a look that says where the fuck do you expect me to go and sputters, “you can’t leave me here?!”
Dean, now resting up on his elbows, neglects to remind him that there’s an open one in the drawer. That view is just too good to pass up. Cas stands and stretches, and Dean can’t resist palming himself with one hand.
“Woah, there.” Charlie holds up her hands. “He’s probably in his room, just it’s weird he’s not come out.”
There’s nothing left in his stomach to throw up except a thin, stringy trail of bile that tastes an awful lot like sulphur.
“Wouldn’t have it any other way. So what’re we thinking, greenhouses and two groundy bits like the plans were, or are we gonna mix it up?”
Dean wakes when Cas gets up, suddenly cold. He reaches out with his eyes closed to drag Cas back to bed – then realises what he’s doing and recoils back, eyes snapping open. Cas doesn’t even seem to have noticed, which is good, but still. Fucking hell, Dean. You gotta be careful.
Dean answers absently, weighing up whether he should just go for the dragon cocktail after all. Smoke in a glass does sound pretty cool. Dunno what the fuck you do with it though, look at it, drink it, fucking huff it?
He attempts to stand, finds it easier than he expected. A little shaky, but upwardly mobile. He opens the door and carefully carries the pasta and weirdly bright orange drink to the bedside table. The smell of food makes his stomach rumble, but he can only manage a few mouthfuls before his unsettled gut protests. Exhaustion hits him suddenly as he picks up the drink, and it’s a struggle to open his eyes, but he forces himself to finish it before he succumbs.
Dean screams, lunges forward. He doesn’t know what he’s going to do, rip and tear and destroy a little more maybe, but Cas intervenes. Strong arms grab him from behind, restrain him. He struggles furiously, too wound up to be calmed by Cas’s touch. That bastard has Sam, that bastard has Sam and he’s fucking mocking them, methodically destroying the things they all love the most. Dean’s car, Sam’s library.  Cas’s...what? If he was less furious that’d be a sobering thought, the realisation that Lucifer didn’t destroy anything of Cas’s, probably because there’s nothing
He finds Cas comparing different chunks of onion against one even cube, deftly shaving bits off until they almost perfectly match. Dean laughs at him, earning an irritated frown, but still not managing to pull Cas’s attention from his ingredients.
“A game similar to pool, where you pocket a number of red balls, followed by the coloured balls in a specific order.”
“Yeah, um, we’ve come across an unusual number of dead angels recently. We’ve been keeping an eye out, warning any we see or know the location of.”
“Shotgun is a sacred right.” Charlie insists. “If we can’t hold to the rules of shotgun, how are we any different to the monsters we fight.” She can see a faint smile trying to break through on Dean’s face, knows he’s mostly playing at being annoyed. So she decides to push him further. “Besides, Cas can’t sit in the front. You’d never look at the road.”
Words that in Cas’s own mouth would sound clumsy and hollow, sing when Lucifer voices them. And that hurts, especially when it seems that they’re going some way to calming Dean down. Eventually his immediate fury subsides, and Lucifer lets him go. But not without a parting gift, a small surge of adrenaline.
Dean covers over the stew and sets the timer for three hours. It’s better the longer you leave it, and with all the effort that goes into prepping the ingredients he’s bushed . He wants nothing more than to crawl into bed and just pass out.
most appropriate place for their first kiss, if you measure it against the rest of their lives. It’s not like they spend much time doing other stuff. He senses that voicing that sentiment is not going to help, though.
The wolfish one seems to tire of the game first. She reels him in, fastens her teeth around his arm but bites down gently, enough to indent, but not puncture his skin.
“We already go there every year, pretty much.” Dean says. “You’ll get your chance to see Vegas, just not now. Unless you really want to?”
Dean tunes out, ignoring Sam’s words in favour of dealing with the churning, wriggling, nasty little hitch in his stomach.The queasy feeling of jealous uselessness. That should have been him, it was his idea. But not only did Sam sort it all out, he did so far better than Dean could ever have managed. What had Dean come up with? Fucking squeeze balls to help with grip and gentle walks and Pilates. Sam made a fucking dossier, poured days of research into it. And that’s a good thing. That’s gonna help Cas.
“So you used the necklace to open a fragmentary rift between here and Oz, and used the power that slipped through before you closed it to give me “magical contacts”.”
If he didn’t have exactly the same thing to say, Dean might call him. Just to talk to someone who isn’t Sam, just to hear his familiar, bored sounding tone. He doesn’t though, because he doesn’t want to drunkenly slur his lack of news down the phone while Sam watches on reproachfully.
“He’s a stubborn asshole and he’s hurting. I know this isn’t what you want to hear, but you’re just going to have to suck it up and either fucking let him ignore you both into early, sad, miserable graves, or you’re going to have to hound him until he lets you get a word in.”
“I can’t hear you.” Dean singsongs to a tune Cas knows is from Spongebob Squarepants. An odd urge to carry on the song flares and is extinguished as Dean lifts his own gun and yells, “FUCK YOU, CROWLEY!” He sounds so deeply venomous that it makes Cas wonder if there’s something he doesn’t know about, some way in which Crowley’s and Dean’s paths have crossed.
“I like the idea of it, but I have no practical skills, or knowledge of whether I’d have an aptitude or not – what’s the term?”
Dean flicks through a few pages of the easier ones, but it’s all boring shit like frogs and butterflies. Cas is almost ready to give up and go to sleep when, finally, Dean stops moaning about how lame all the options are and points to one in the middle of the list.
“What sort of stuff do you wanna pick up, Cas?” Dean asks idly, passing his plate over to Sam in a very clear statement of
“And I know you’re mad, but you can’t just fucking lash out at him because he’s the closest thing. Cas didn’t destroy all your stuff. Fucking bad luck and whatever is causing your dreams did.”
“Tch.” She makes a disparaging noise, but heaves herself to her feet. “I guess if it’s important shit like that I should help you bring it in, then.”
Someone needs to know what Cas’s plan is, even if he doesn’t intend on sharing it. Despite what he might want or think, this is not the sort of secret that anyone should be allowed to carry by themselves, and especially not to their grave.
It’s not the same, it doesn’t fix things. Doesn’t mean it’s not nice. Doesn’t mean he doesn’t love her too, in a very different way.
He unwinds on his own after the long drive, gets his trunks on and wanders slowly over to Dean and Cas’s cabin. Cas answers the door, dripping wet and excited looking.
Charlie finds an old, rusted tap embedded in the north wall and, with a bit of coaxing has it working by the time Dean comes back with an antique looking shovel, a pair of vicious looking garden sheers and a rucksack thrown over one shoulder.
The room is cold and smells slightly of mildew. Arranged in a rough circle are fourteen chairs. They’re lumpy and uncomfortable and Cas can’t stop fidgeting. Because of the discomfort. Definitely all that's going on here.
“That doesn’t mean you’re coping. You sounded pretty cut up – and pretty drunk – when you called me.”
He wants to be convinced so badly, but Hannah’s words are still ringing around his head, won’t let him accept Sam’s judgement with grace.
Dean starts to slowly unbutton Cas’s shirt with one hand, the other cupping the back of his neck.  Cas shucks his shirt and Dean breaks the kiss, pushes at his shoulders gently, encouraging him to fall down onto the bed. He does, props himself up on his elbows while Dean inches his pants off him, strips himself quickly naked and presses himself against Cas’s lithe frame.
Cas lets up the weight and Dean pulls a quick breath of relief which turns to a cut off gasp when Cas starts to knead him through his jeans. He’s using just the right amount of pressure and god, it feels amazing. Having someone’s crusty feet all up in his junk wouldn’t usually be hot, at all, but this is Cas. Cas who doesn’t sweat, or get athlete’s foot, who probably doesn’t even get lint stuck between his toes.
Sam stands in the doorway for a moment, looks at Dean lying on the floor, making no effort to get up.
“I’ve been thinking about what you said, and you were right, Dean. Okay. Doesn’t matter what the evidence suggests, this is Cas. We know him.”
He hears her vaguely, like she’s behind glass or under water or some other metaphorical bullshit. It takes concerted effort to drag himself back to the here and now. He nearly doesn’t apply it, but there’s something in her muffled tone, something that sounds like maybe it might be urgent.
He comes out of the room to find Dean and Cas sitting on the sofa. They’re as shabbily dressed as he is, so at least if they make a bad impression, they’re going to make it en-masse.
“I want to move my things in here, but as I have neither the strength, nor a long enough leash,” Sam flinches, “I require your help.”
Dean hasn’t even got his fucking boxers off yet, hasn’t had his cock touched, and okay he’s not gonna come just from Cas teasing at his thighs – probably, hopefully. He doesn’t think his pride could take it.
The tension doesn’t bleed out of Dean. It creeps out inch by inch, until he’s in an almost meditative state, swaying lightly on his feet. Cas removes his hand, strokes down the side of Dean’s cheek and gently tugs at his elbow, leading him away to his bedroom.
The world that she was born in, it might be shit in a lot of ways, but so is Oz – and her world still has a hold on her. She feels the tug every time she crosses into Oz – could always sense, like some sort of psychic pull – the distance and direction of the nearest portal home.
“The rubber ball – I know that probably wasn’t its intended purpose, but it’ll be building up the strength and the flexibility in your hands.”
“I managed to get clean for a while, but I wasn’t okay. I missed the drugs, there was something about them that made me feel powerful, righteous. How I’d felt before the break with my family. I relapsed in the worst way, and my partner bore the pain for that. I can’t do that to him again, I can’t rely just on him. I need to spread the weight of this struggle – I need your help.”
Dean looks a shade disappointed, clearly hoping for something more romantic, but at least Charlie joked about it so he only thinks Cas is doing it to tease him.
Human Cas appears to be an adrenaline junkie thrill seeker, and Dean isn’t sure how he feels about it. He goes on rides with him, because he’s not a baby, but that doesn’t mean he particularly enjoys it. He’d much rather be sitting down with a beer and some greasy burger than being thrown across the sky.
He’s heaving in great breaths but he can’t seem to get enough air regardless, and it hurts, it hurts.
He starts off simple, tongue laving the sensitive head of Cas’s cock, running it up and down, hollowing his cheeks and getting just that right amount of suction, but then he deviates from the normal pattern.
This fic continues to be an absolute clusterfuck comedy of errors. Somehow the version of chapter 51 I have is from a fairly old draft and as such is Not Correct - something I did not notice when I uploaded it in a panic before Christmas. For now I've just removed one sentence from Dean's dialogue with Charlie that makes it work better, I'll go back and re-edit it when I have time, because yes, I have somehow lost the correct chapter.
“Sam” disappears, comes back with a washcloth and a basin of water. He stands near Cas, just out of arms reach, like he’s waiting for a fucking invitation or something.
Cas bursts into the clearing, sees Benny pinning Dean to the ground. He launches himself over, grabs the vampire by the collar and flings him away, howling with rage. White grace gathers in Cas’s left hand. He’s reduced, weakened by his toil, but he still just has enough left to atomise this bastard and stay conscious.
instead. I couldn’t make him beg for himself, but I could make him beg for them, and he did beg, pitifully.”
“Is that okay?” Dean asks as he shuts it, suddenly realising that maybe closed doors aren’t something Cas likes anymore, like maybe he needs an escape route in his eye-line. Cas is touched, hadn’t even thought of that. He doesn’t associate doors with his captivity. That’s, other things. He grits his teeth, forces his mind ruthlessly onto a different track, forces himself to speak in the hope that the exhaustion will distract him.
Cas pokes him in the ribs again. Sam, who up until now has been smothering his laughter with his hand, lets out a snort.
“Hey, kiddo.” He nudges her shoulder, and she springs awake, ready to fight him it looks like. “Hey, hey, easy. Just the guy giving you a lift.”
Cas tries so hard not to react to the sound of Dean’s voice. Bless. Like he can hide anything from Lucifer. Like Lucifer doesn’t know exactly what’s going on here, hasn’t raked through Cas’s hopes and desires and fears and seen one person occupying the prime spot in all three.
That’s how Sam finds him, hours later. Soup gone cold, untouched. His pillow is damp from a mixture of tears and a puddle of bile he couldn’t be bothered to move to expel.
Dean doesn’t say anything, scrabbles for the blade with his other hand, even though he knows it’s pointless, even though he knows it’s obvious, that she’ll see what he’s doing. He should have picked a better place for the stupid sigil, because it’s on the arm that’s free, and unfortunately his elbows don’t bend the right way to activate it.
He looks hopefully over at Sam. He’s just pleasantly buzzed enough to want to carry on drinking. Maybe he’ll encourage Cas to slow down a bit, though. Don’t want him throwing up on his shoes or anything.
Loathe as Cas would be to have to consume demon blood, it’s better than the alternative. Lucifer with access to his full complement of heavenly powers.
The panic starts to rise up in Cas again and he shoves it down, hopes Lucifer attributes it to the fact that he’s about to take them to see Dean, and not to Cas’s frozen inability to decide one way or another – stay with the devil or flee.
The first spike is excruciatingly painful. Things get a bit fuzzy after that. He knows the angel is talking, he'd be fucked if he knows what she's saying though. Probably some more drivel about him being a demon and who did he kill to get his juice lalalalalalala.
“Got nothing to be sorry for.” Dean says it with enough conviction that anyone but Cas would’ve been fooled.
This is Cas, the guy who can do anything he wants to, when he puts his formidable mind to it. Sam wouldn’t put it past him to fucking crawl out of the bunker while he was asleep, if the whim took him.
Cas’s room fills steadily up with origami. Basic at first, hats and simple, geometric animals, but getting more complex all the time. A little cardboard wolf sits on his bedframe. She has a pack too, but somehow none of her fellows turned out quite right. She was the first, and the best. Cas calls her Charlie. Because the little paper wolf is a present, and he doesn’t want to give her a proper name, gives her that of her future owner as a placeholder instead.
A kiss on the forehead. Just vague enough, just unclear enough to allow Dean to interpret it whichever way he wants. Or maybe just vague enough to protect Cas, who fucking knows anymore.
Cas grits his teeth. This conversation is starting to grate on him. More, because he knows Dean has a point.
Cas might not be divine anymore, but he still doesn’t smell quite human. There’s enough angel lingering in his veins to make him smell exotic, there’s not enough left to make him seem dangerous.
“Did you? Did you see him lure me away and stand and let it happen, shrug your shoulders and decide it wasn’t worth the effort trying to find me?”
. Because you know what, sometimes it’s nice to read something where everyone is queer and nothing is LGBT related pain. Sure, there’s pain, but it’s not woe is me for I am gay and my life is a tragic lesbian struggle pain.
“Guess what?” Dean asks, spearing his shovel down into the dirt. It promptly falls over and he rolls his eyes at it, gives it a mild kick.
“Hmm. Not really. I forced the door to open, but it’s knows something is wrong. There’ll be demons on the way to check.”
Lucifer hums in smug satisfaction, turns back to Dean. He pretends to comfort him, all the time pushing buttons he knows will only serve to further rile him up.
“Keen.” Dean notes, standing up too. “We’re gonna have to wrap you up a bit first, though. I know it’s like April, but it’s still 55F out and you ain’t got much in the way of insulation.”
Hannah doesn’t roll her eyes, because she is an angel, and dignified in the face of the enemy, but she can feel Caroline trying to.
Dean turns on the TV, an old portable thing they picked up for a few bucks, and they pass the bottle back and forth in silence but for the buzz and chatter of the screen. Neither of them want to be alone with their thoughts right now, and neither of them are quite ready to talk about any of this just yet.
“I don’t, Dean. I don’t know how you’re in purgatory again, I don’t know why you’re here or why you’re trying to kill yourself. So maybe do me the benefit of explainin?”
A blur of fangs and claws whirls out at him from the side. He flicks the sword up just in time to shield himself from the blow, slices down along the first werewolf’s arm. Another comes at him from behind and he spins around and sheathes the blade in her chest. She snarls at him, angry, but definitely not dead, and lunges to grab at the weapon. Dean kicks her off it, throws himself to the side and into the path of another wolf, who he beheads with a quick slash.
“Don’t hurt him!” Claire yells, frantic, forgetting that telling a demon not to do something is tantamount to an invitation.
It doesn’t take long for them both to come. He’s been close from watching her come the first time, the smell and taste of her, and she was already nearly there before he started to thrust.
They spend a couple of days in Yellowstone, trundling along in their borrowed vehicle, drinking in the sights of canyons and geysers, lakes, valleys and basins. They don’t see any more wolves, much to Dean’s disappointment, but they come across plenty of bison and deer – even get slightly too close to a bear at one point. Damn, those things are big.
Cas doesn’t, instead he switches topic abruptly. “The energy this spell would require.” He trails off with a distracted little hum, but starts talking again before anyone can interrupt him. He knows Dean registered his avoidance, but hopefully he can steamroll his way past it for now. “This isn’t actually the original spell, it’s an adaptation. The original spells draws power from human souls. The person who made this revision, they thought they were making it less harmful. They were wrong, of course. There’s something uniquely powerful about a human soul – there’s a reason heaven and hell are always squabbling over them, and it’s got nothing to do with redemption or evil these days.
He hadn’t expected to find Cas here.. He’s not used to the things he dreams about happening. He’s not used to wanting something, and it happening wholly the way he desires.
Sam doesn’t say anything for a while, looks out of the window at the silhouettes of trees, city lights in the distance.
“Because, I,” he stutters, unable to put it into words but still fucking trying anyway. “Because I need to make sure he’s safe.”
Dean snorts. “Choice is overrated. It was so much easier when you just picked the least worst option out of the four and a half channels your dumb motel could get and just dealt with it.”
Two chapters to get the ball rolling and then it’ll be one every Monday and Thursday as long as everything goes to plan. It’s all written, just some of the later chapters need a little extra work, so I don’t foresee any issues.
Dean steps over to Crowley, still shouting and railing against his fate, and decks him. It doesn’t achieve quite the desired result. Now there are two people in pain instead of just one. Dean shakes his hand and grimaces.
“To take revenge.” The angel who has yet to speak, inhabiting a middle-aged Ukrainian with a thick accent, corrects.
Dean unwinds himself from Charlie’s arms, and she doesn’t stir. The only thing that stops him from tearing out of the room and to a bar is the knowledge that they’re maybe hours away from finding the guy who did this and he can’t let Cas down again. He’s gotta do this, and then he can go and drink himself to a blackout, or an early grave, or just fucking numbness.
The demon places a hand on Dean’s forehead, concentrates on keeping him unconscious. A boring job, but one given to her by Lucifer returned. There will be rewards.
“I was kinda, well. Kinda hoping that maybe we could go back and pick her up together at some point? All of us, down the line when you’re up for travelling. A mini road trip to bring her back home.”
they do now with no driving force, be it another apocalypse or Dean getting a bit too excited about the prospect of a holiday.
“Yeah, y’know, one of those squidgy things – you have ‘em and when you’re pissed or stressed you crush ‘em in your hand instead of rearranging some dude’s face.”
They make a quick stop at the motel to grab their stuff, and then Sam drives them to another one halfway across town, on the principle of it’s probably not a great idea to stay in the same place as a group of people you’ve just tried to kick the shit out of.
“You know the principles of vaccination, yes? A weaker version of something foreign and harmful is introduced to your body in order to teach it how to fight off the real thing.”
Dean doesn’t say anything, but his control wavers, a single tear breaking loose and sliding down his face.
Dean laughs. “Yeah, get used to that. It’ll come to you for no fucking reason few hours, once you’ve stopped caring, and really piss you off.”
He grits his teeth in agony as his back in pummelled. He can feel blood, slick and wet, dripping down his spine and he thinks one of his arms might be breaking under the strain, but still he holds. He can recover from this, given time and patience. Sam and Dean will likely die if any of this rubble manages to score a direct hit.
Cas can see by the tension in his shoulders that Dean has come to some bullshit “realisation”, grinds his teeth in displeasure. Dean turns the stove off, finally turns around.
Dean doesn’t know, but he figures maybe that’ll come with time. Hopes they fucking have time for it to come.
Sam is just standing up to intervene – pull Cas’s arm out of the way and let Dean escape or something, when the need is removed. Cas lets go, but Dean doesn’t try and roll away this time. He stays supine as Cas sits bolt upright, eyes flaring open and burning blue-white with grace.
On the sofa, Sam doesn’t know whether he wants to start writing epic poetry, or throw up a little in his mouth.
“I’m being unfairly attacked here.” Dean makes a token effort at defending himself, but, as usual, no one fucking listens. Bastards.
But then, even if Cas says it’s okay, does that make it right? He’s supposed to be putting his effort into being there for Cas right now, fixing the damage he did to their relationship. Can he do that if he’s slipping back into old, bad habits, bad patterns?
Dean realises he’s still brandishing the knife, tucks it back away and draws in a shaky breath. He needs to tell Cas what he saw, but he’s got no idea how to force the words out.
He’s not saying that to one up Cas, or to be cruel. He’s just trying to remind him that it’s fine, that it can be done.
“It didn’t mention that in the book.” Sam says slowly, possibly thinking of all the times it could have come in useful. Cas hastens to cut off that line of thought.
“I get that having a portable wheelbarrow garden might be cool, but could you not have told me that was the plan before I spent days weeding and prepping the ground, man?” Dean jokes, when he returns to see all the plants still where he’d left them.
With a disgusted grimace she picks up the bowl, settles it on her hip and then turns to Cas “So.” She says. “Long walk back, no demons in sight for the foreseeable. I think now’s the point where you explain why I lied through my teeth about this spell to all of your little friends.”
Sam slides into shotgun position, throwing Dean a look over his shoulder, part concern and part something else. Dean can’t place the reason for it, until he realises what’s funny about this picture. Sam in the front seat, looking back at Dean. For the second time that day.
Cas grimaces, fidgets and resettles, so he’s sitting opposite but not touching. He takes Dean’s hands and looks at him, right in the eyes, and now Dean’s scared.  Really and properly scared.
He tucks his gun into the back of his jeans, trusts Charlie to cover him, and approaches with his hands up in the air. The kid backs away again, into the cabin, but Dean follows, hand high as he can get them, muttering what he hopes are reassuring noises. He scouts around for a first aid kit, spots one fixed to the wall near the door. He grabs it down, gets out gauze and wound dressings.
She wonders if it’s in her too, if it’s passed on from father to feckless progeny. Or if maybe she’s more of her mother – someone who puts herself first. She hopes so. She’s seen what sacrifice like that does to a family, grabs a lump of it with both hands and wrenches it apart, leaves the remaining pieces bloody edged and scabby.
They sit there, feet dangling off the cliff-edge, and they watch the sunrise. At one point Cas notices the proximity of their hands, rests his gently over Dean’s. He waits for Dean to pull away, tell him this isn’t what he imagined. Instead Dean links their fingers together, looks over at him with this sort of bemused but impressed look.
“Y’know, hearing that story makes me wonder if breaking a mirror really is that unlucky.” Charlie teases. “You’ve had some shitty hands, sure, but you also met Cas and came back from the dead like a bajillion times. Can’t be that unlucky.”
Cas rolls his eyes, carves more lines across Sam’s face in short, sharp slashes. When he’s done he takes Sam’s fingers, trails them over the wounds so that he can feel the shape of them.
And Dean looks at him again, looks at him less like he’s a trap, and more like he’s a real person – like he’s the fucking love of his life asking him to stay, when that’s the only thing he wants to do in the world.
And Dean doesn’t want to be brutal, but this is about Cas’s safety. He grabs Cas’s hand, pulls it away from his face and jerks at it to get Cas’s attention.
He ends up in something called the Enchanted Cave. It’s dark, eerie and definitely his favourite place in the museum.
It’s not a demon, or a ravening horde of werewolves, or even a very lost and bemused door to door salesman. It’s a bedraggled looking Cas and Rowena.
“You think you escaped, you think you foiled my plan but you didn’t. I win if you suffer, and what has every moment since you’ve escaped been but suffering?”
If she fails here, she might pay with her life. It might not be her fault, that doesn’t mean they’ll believe that.
“Someone texted him a location from Cas’s phone – which we know is broken – and dared him to go there to find out the answer to this mystery. False lead or trap. Probably both.”
“Frogs are easy.” Sam explains, grinning. “I learned how to do them in high school. Whereas that dragon you’re trying to do is way hard, like, expert hard.”
“It’d be better if you died, and you know it. Dean would be free, and Sam, and the other one. But you won’t. You’re a coward – only ever thinking of yourself.” Cahor spits the last word, and Cas flinches violently.
“Not everything is about how it makes Dean feel.” Cas says eventually, fingers curled into a slight claw.
“You’re not going to die, Cas.” Sam says, and he means it, with all his soul. “We’ve got you safe, here.”
Warmth, he thinks. That’s the name of the sensation he can feel in the furthest depths of his extremities. Nowhere else though. It’s a start, right?
Us. Or Dean, picking up the book in a drunken fit from where it lay on the bed, open at the first page. Snarling at the sight of Cas’s entry, ripping it out and throwing the book across the room, crumpling the paper up in his fist and dropping it on the floor, swaying and leaning as he reached for another bottle.
“Yeah? And if we’d had a lead while you were off passed out in a gutter getting the shit kicked out of you, what then?”
Sam watches her go and then folds himself into his vehicle. He drums his hands on the wheel and debates his next move. He’s not exactly made his peace with Cas’s decision yet, but he doesn’t think he’s still in the rage and argue stage. He might be okay to go back.
“I didn’t kill Dean?” He chokes out the question, doesn’t understand why his heart is racing and his chest feels like it’s cracking in two. The only blood on his hands is his own, that should be a relief, but it isn’t, it isn’t.
” Cas says, as he gets to his feet, stumbles to the door and practically falls through it, grasping onto the door-frame. “I don’t think you understand, Sam. You’re talking like you have
He snatches the phone out of her hand, scrolls through the email chain. Hands it back without looking at the pictures.
Cas pauses for a long moment, long enough that Dean starts to think, hey, maybe he’s gonna spill something. And then Cas sighs, says, “Nothing more than usual.”
I am such an arsehole. There isn't going to be a chapter next week because I will either be in or around Berlin for a music festival, and because I'm there for the entire week, I
“Sam, you said certain magic stresses make you more vulnerable to others.” Dean adds, in a grudging tone. Like admitting that the Mark of Cain, the embodiment  of evil,  is a strain on him is akin to admitting he’s weak and pathetic.
For the first time he welcomes the forest. Let it take him, let him fucking rage through it, all fury and wrath and destruction. If he can’t drown his demons, can’t outrun them, then he’s just going to have to fucking outfight them.
“I love you, but I can’t do this if every time something goes wrong, you flip out and push me away. It hurts, more, I think, than a clean break would.”
Sorry this took so long -  I've been applying for jobs so writing cover letters kinda took precedence.
If Dean wasn’t so angry he’d probably appreciate the symbolism. As is, he just storms off into the woods.
When he gets back to hell he’ll have to amplify the spell. He has all the souls of the damned at his command. He can probably spare a few for a spell this important.
Lucifer doesn’t give the fear time to ferment, just in case Dean should suddenly get cold feet. He has a lot of superstitions regarding his wants, and if he gets a chance to overthink this he’s likely to decide that there’ll be a price for it that he can’t match – that this will come back to hurt him and Cas in some unfathomably connected way.
He grits his teeth as that thought washes through him, cold water to the boiling, seething bloodlust. And like cold water mixed with hot blood, it dilutes it, cools it a little. Doesn’t get rid of it entirely. There’s only one way he’s going to get rid of this entirely, and that’s to feed the Mark, sate it with some kind of blood offering. Except the only way he’s getting out of that door, through Sam and Cas, brings him too close to them. He can’t risk removing the only barrier between them now, not when the Mark has just shown its hand, what it can do if it decides to hold back and stock up.
He crawls to the end of the bed, settles down and bats Cas’s hand away from the buckle. He grabs the half undone belt, uses it to pull Cas closer.
Today she watches, makes sure that Dean doesn’t lie down and choke to death on his own stringy trails of not quite vomit. And then, when he’s done, when he wipes a hand across the back of his mouth and stands up, shakey and fucked up, she puts on her best mom voice.
Then he turns back to the wreck of the classic car laid out in front of him. Just so much scrap metal now.
Sam sits down on the other pillow, stretches out a hand and then pulls it back. He doesn’t know what Cas is thinking, what Cas wants. Well, no, he does. He just knows he can’t offer it.
Dean shrugs. “They’re adults, and they’re locked inside Fort fucking Knox. How much trouble do you think they’re really gonna get into?”
“Go to sleep, Dean.” Cas cuts him off, brusque, cruel. He flinches at his own words, wants so badly to turn around and apologise, to comfort Dean. But he can’t. Can’t force his dead, tired body to move –can’t speak past the block in his throat.
He grits his teeth, rubs at his eye – even though he knows neither pressure nor darkness actually help, he’s never been able to resist the urge to try in case something has magically changed.
Cas tips his head, gesturing for Sam to get back inside the bunker. Cas moves forward slowly, carefully. Approaching a wounded animal. He holds his hands out in front of him, high over his head. His bare hands are weapons, he knows that, Dean knows that.
“Hey, if you want to sit and listen to him complain about the correct places to put food for the next hour feel free.” Sam says. “I was trying to save you from a fate worse than death.”
Dean whines, disappointed, but unwraps his legs from around Cas and allows himself to be lowered to the ground.
Cas opens him up quick and dirty – one hand exploring his ass, scissoring and stretching it open while the other stays twisted in his hair, holding his head back as he licks and sucks and bites.
it’d just speed up the recovery process – but Dean doesn’t even notice him, just carries on. “I’d fucking sign up like that, but I’m not putting Cas through that. Dude’s spent months chained up, drugged out of his mind unable to decide a single goddamn thing for himself. What right have we got to deny him this one?”
“So, should one of us call Sarah, get her in on this breakfast party, or will she still be asleep?” Dean asks, as he bats Sam out of the way and retrieves everything he needs for bacon pancakes.
She pulls back to look him directly in the eye, lets blue sparks hiss and crackle underneath her skin. He isn’t cowed. He draws himself up to full height, stares her down.
“Are you kidding me? The kids are just getting put to bed, those rooms are soundproofed as all fuck, and they always nominate two designated sober babysitters. You’ve got about half an hour before all hell breaks loose.”
Cold water drenches his head and chest and the shock is enough to bring him back into the room. Charlie standing in front of him, holding an empty basin, Sam’s arms wrapped around him in a grip so tight he can barely breathe.
Dean swills the whiskey around some more, tries to clear his mind, focus on the colour. He wants to drink it but he can’t quite make his hand lift it up to his mouth. Can’t quite make himself commit to doing anything. Stuck in limbo, stuck in – no. Not going there.
Hannah pops out of existence. Cahor doesn’t even have time to react before there’s a white heat at the base of his spine, and then pretty much nothing. He stumbles, is starting to fall, and that doesn’t matter because his legs might be affected but his arms aren’t, he can just dig the bullet out again and everything will be fine.
It might not have been much, but it was theirs. A room is just a room, at the end of the day. It doesn’t matter. What mattered was what was inside it, the accumulated debris of two lives, settled together. Some things important, some less so, but all a part of the space that they were building together. Now the room is just a burned out shell, a fucking carcass.
Dean feels the sofa sink a little as Cas sits down. He notices with some glee that Cas isn’t curled up on the other arm, he’s right next to Dean – close but not quite touching. It’s absurd that something so small feels like a victory, but it does, and it throws Dean out of his stride. He sputters to a halt.
“I think what Sam meant to say was that we need to consider all the options. A lot of bad things have happened to you, Dean. More than most people could bare-”
Sam stumbles into the kitchen just as they’re nearly ready, all red faced and sweaty and decked out in running gear.
They hold off as long as possible, until Dean’s stomach lets out a rolling, roiling grumble that makes him and Cas both laugh until their headaches begin to ratchet up again.
Dean wants to kiss him, so badly – closer to goddamn need – but he can’t break this up, bring Cas out of whatever moment of peace he’s having.
Sam’s heart nearly stops, but he doesn’t ask what, just runs after her as she darts out of the room, clearly intending for them both to follow.
“Weed and heroin are completely different, Dean.” Sam says in the kind of soothing tone that works on kids but makes adults want to punch him. “Weed isn’t going to slingshot him straight back to heroin.”
Instead, he shuffles to the kitchen, brews himself a coffee and thinks about clearing out the room. He can’t leave it to his emotionally repressed idiot brother and his delightful protégé, if it was up to them Sam knows what’d happen. They’d board up the door and pretend like it was nothing. Except no, they probably wouldn’t even get that far, because closing it up would be the same as admitting that there’s something behind the boards that they’re trying to keep out, keep away from themselves.
Dean dumps a bowl of steaming hot pasta outside his and Cas’s room, slips a note under the door with it. Hopefully even if he doesn’t smell it, he’ll still notice the paper before it gets cold. Dean doesn’t want to knock, and his first bright idea of sending a text had been scuppered when he remembered that Cas’s phone is in a bin somewhere, smashed and bloody. He’ll have to talk to Sam about getting him a new one – something fancy, with lots of gadgets and features and crap.  Band-Aid over a bullet wound, or bribery or whatever you wanna call it, but fuck it. If he can’t fix the big things, he can at least offer some small shit like this.
She reaches up to wipe her eye – it’s watering, some little irritant stuck in there that she can’t seem to blink away. She looks at her finger to see if she got it, the eyelash or the speck of dust, does a double take when all she sees is red. She starts to scramble around in her bag, looking for a phone screen or a mirror to examine herself in.
“Shuddup. I can learn. Charlie says you can teach yourself anything on the internet, and it’s not like I’m lacking in trees to practice on.”
He saves the worst bit for last. Checking Cahor’s cuffs. He disables the motion sensor and approaches the angel. He didn’t have music the first time, could hear every goddamn word the bastard spewed out. It was a mistake he won’t make again.
Cas doesn’t remove Dean’s clothes delicately, he fucking tears them off. Grabs hold of the front of Dean’s shirt and rips it off him, drops it to the ground. The tee underneath it only escapes the same treatment because Dean shrugs it off hastily. Literally ripping his clothes off is hot, don’t get him wrong he fucking loves it, but this is the last shirt he has without bloodstains.
“Welcome to the natatorium.” Sam says, opening the door and switching on the lights. Cas follows him, doesn’t look too impressed.
The look on Dean’s face when he sees the cuts is priceless. Denial and terror and hatred and disgust. A glorious cocktail of all the things Lucifer savours the most.
“Fuck you, we’re interesting people.” Sam says. “And no, actually. I’m kinda relieved to see it. He wasn’t sleeping well at all before.”
His muzzy brain panics, puts together the apparently harmless words with the way that Dean’s been behaving – like he’s ashamed of him, not wanting to touch him even in the safety of a motel room half a mile away from those hunters, even when his secret is out.
He’s about three quarters of the way down the bottle when his phone starts ringing. Charlie. He answers, in case it’s a lead or something , even though there’s jackshit he could do in this condition.
them through all this fucking sideways rain, would we? I can barely see you and you’re nearly as tall as the Space Needle.”
Hello lovely people. Sorry it's a wee bit shorter than usual, but it's been MENTAL at work because of the sudden interest in the refugee crisis. So many lovely people donating or emailing in to offer up their houses, their time and their resources.
Dean grabs his gun from his waistband and fires, misses because his hands are shaking too bad, and the fucker is sprinting past him, and he’s not going for the door, he’s going for the fucking window. He barrels out, and Dean shoots again but it’s just a fucking wasted bullet.
He wouldn’t even shoot the TV host for the fucking mental trauma, probably, if it just meant that none of this bullshit had really happened.
Hannah pulls in a deep breath, strides over to the kid and heals him with an impersonal brush of her fingers.
A sharp but minor pain brings Cas back into the present. The angel blade, pressing into his arm hard enough to draw blood but not much else.
“Don’t, I don’t need a pity party right now. I need to find this fucking son of a bitch and get him back to the bunker.”
But right now there’s no room for self-loathing in Dean, it’s all rage. He tries to fight Cas’s grip, but Cas has angelic strength and unlimited patience, and they both know he’s not going to be the first one to crack.
Charlie leaves out the part about Hannah wanting Dean to suffer, because more tension between the two of them is the LAST thing anyone needs right now.
Dean doesn’t notice at first, asleep on his chest. Eventually, subconsciously, he feels something, starts to stir.
Benny thinks he hears a note of something under the snark and the malice, not regret, necessarily, maybe a ruefulness. Maybe a whole huge fucking heap of wishful thinking on Benny’s part.
He starts, reaches a hand up to touch it – this doesn’t make a lick of sense. The bloodlust isn’t something that just wears off if you spend enough time away from humans. And even if it was, he’s not been down here long – was down here longer the first time, when Dean’s presence was so potent.
“I wanna talk to Claire.” Dean tells Charlie, because he can’t stand the sight of Sam’s face right now. It’s too, dunno. Too something.
There’s a rap on his door, and he so nearly ignores it. He’s got nothing he wants to say to Sam, or Charlie or Rowena, or whoever the fuck it is.
He tries again. “That doesn’t te...” He trails off, though before he can finish. There’s something about the expression on Cas’s face. He looks like the last thing he needs is to rake this over – eyes unfocussed and right hand twitching lightly against the bed.
Dean knows from experience that there’s nothing holy about the tools she’s unpacking. Before hell just looking at these things would’ve put the fear of god into him – and he can’t help a little bark of hysterical laughter at the phrasing his brain chooses to throw up –  now he can look at them all with a sort of detached, clinical evaluation – rate them in order of pain and severity. Rate them in order of effectiveness, too. He knows which one you should start with, which to follow up with to get the most pain with the least amount of damage.
They stay there for a long while, until Dean starts to feel exhausted, uncomfortable. Cas helps him up, mojos them both clean with a flick of his wrist. Dean doesn’t even complain about the waste of grace, just collapses down into bed and pulls Cas close until they’re curled up together, chest to chest.
“Is that why you’re here, because you wanted to come and make sure he never found out about our adventures? Because you thought that maybe if he didn’t know you were ruined beyond all repair then maybe you’d be able to work everything out.” Cahor’s grin widens. “Well, it’s too late.
“And anyway, this session was just to teach you how to do the exercises. You can keep on doing them at intervals throughout the day, whenever you feel recovered enough.”
“If you’re well enough to backchat me in full sentences, I figure you’re also capable of sitting upright. Have at it.”
Her tone suggests that she has thought about it, many, many times, but is still wrestling with the logistics of putting a tracer on beings made mostly of wavelengths, and who don’t possess their own corporeal bodies.
Musings on one of hell’s many illicit trades aside, Crowley spends a lot of his time planning and worrying. The worrying, because up until now he just expected a relatively straightforward death, and now he expects torture, bargaining, revenge. The whole shebang. But he’s also plotting – because incredible agony though he may be about to receive, the good thing about being tortured is it means you’re not dead, and if you’re not dead, that’s an opportunity.
Cas shrugs, breaks eye contact and draws a sigil in chalk on the table, places the bowl in the middle.
Jody listens in silence as Sam runs her through the highlight reel of the last four months, give or take. It throws him a little when he works it out in his head. Cas went missing in the dying days of December, the weird hollow period between Christmas and new year – and now it’s April. A whole third of the year gone.
They need to start treating each other better. There’s always a degree of lashing out and fighting in a small, closed group. It’s okay – ish – between Sam and Dean, they get it, they understand that it’s nothing personal. Cas, well. The shit they’ve dumped on him, how could he not take any sideswipe to heart.
“Or that.” Sam agrees. He can’t keep the scepticism out of his voice, but either Dean lets it slide, or he isn’t listening.
Claire steps through the door, dripping onto the bunker’s front mat, and no one mentions the fact that she hitchhiked a few hundred miles in a fit of furious, reckless disregard for her own safety. No one mentions that she looks like she hasn’t slept in days, that her makeup has run, although in fairness to her, that could have been something to do with the rain.
They do eventually get it in the room, several chipped off layers of paint later – but mostly after Sam ambles past on his way back from wherever he’d been hiding to avoid all the hard work, and suggests that maybe they should take it out of the box and it’d be smaller, you goddamn idiots.
“Your understanding of tradition is quaint and short lived.” And that, apparently, is all she feels needs to be said on the subject, because she abruptly plunges the gold blade into Dean’s heart.
Sam dresses him, helps him back into the bedroom, sets him down on the bed, and then he dithers. The cuff is sitting there, attached to the bedframe, accusatory. It’s not like Cas is going to be able to escape, he can barely stand unaided, and yet.
He drives home, and at home he drinks the best part of two bottles of whiskey. Deliberately, spitefully, even as his stomach is roiling and threatening to rebel.
“Hey, wait, wait.” Dean interrupts. “You gotta look at the table properly – don’t just think about how the shot will affect the ball you hit, think about how it’ll leave the table afterwards. You hit that red one and it’ll clip Charlie’s yellow there, leaving her open for a perfect shot.”
The Impala is parked a few blocks away – Dean saw the sheer volume of keyed cars in the Red Lagoon motel’s car park and declared that no fucking way was his baby staying anywhere near. They split three ways once they’re out the window, less risk.
Sam feels the relief like a physical blow. Dean clearly isn’t okay, but at least he’s y’know, uh, okay. Yeah that doesn’t make sense but fuck it, one of his last remaining friends just died, he’s allowed to be a little mentally challenged.
They stay there for a long time, silent, with Cas slowly carding his fingers through Dean’s hair, watching the night sky, staring up at the stars, and down at them too.
Dean finishes his beer, looks ruefully at the bar. He wants another, but he needs to leave. He can only put off all this bullshit for so long before he has to go back, confront or not confront Sam, start hoarding fucking evidence like Sherlock Holmes but with more guns and his Doctor Watson equivalent who knows how far away doing who knows what.
There’s no emotion in Dean’s voice. Sam can’t tell what he’s thinking – and that’s not usual. Dean’s a fucking open book when it comes to Cas.
Charlie ignores Dean’s relentless pacing, resists making a comment about wearing tracks in the carpet. She knows it’ll just bounce off him, like everything seems to these days. He’s not drinking at the moment, but she knows it’s only a pause. The minute she takes her eye off him, he’ll be chugging it down again. He’s throwing himself into this, into the hunt and the fight, but when they’re gone, all that pain and all that bullshit is still going to be there. Is probably going to take him down with it.
He’s been gone for months. They have no idea what his headspace is. He needs to wake up somewhere safe, somewhere restrained. Not in the backseat of an unfamiliar car, thinking he’s still fucking captive. He could do fucking anything.
She gets unsteadily to her feet, and the world spins and threatens to dump her on the ground. Okay, yeah. She’ll just sit down here on the grass for five minutes. Five minutes, just to get her breath back. Except rest is inactivity, and inactivity is space to think.
“Does it matter what number?” Cas asks, twiddling the joystick back and forth across the row of numbers.
“He was muttering something about revenge. Revenge for what I don’t know. Maybe I grew a forest through his house and he took it badly.” She snickers.
The next day he feels a little less physically shitty, so he goes for a drive. He’s relying on the Impala to settle him. He drives for hours and hours, not really caring where he ends up. Not checking the backseat for surprise passengers.
There’s a forest, or a nature reserve or something, on the edge of the beach, and Cas steers him towards that.
Sam tries to grab him, hold him back, but Dean’s fear lets him access new reserves of strength and he pulls away and dives forward. He slows at the pile, tenderly removes a ragged blanket to reveal a figure, so small, so fucking small and curled in on himself, shrouded in a tan trench coat that was too big for him on a good day, and now drowns his skeletal frame.
It would be hard, he knows that. Not physically – he’ll be bound and defenceless, Dean will have seen to that. It shouldn’t be mentally hard, either. Not after everything that Cahor did. The real Cas, the old Cas would have been brimming with righteous fury. He wouldn’t have cared how weak his body was, he’d have dragged himself down here on his hands and knees on that very first day. Taken his blade and plunged it into Cahor’s chest and ended things.
Cas looks at him blankly, slowly looks around the room, as if expecting Sam to press a button and reveal a hidden pool or something. When that doesn’t seem to be forthcoming he simply asks, “Where?”
He’s in agony, but he doesn’t die. The wolf and the horse join hands, start to chant something over his body that causes his wounds to begin to knit together. The crow scolds them, slaps at their arms and forces them to stop. They do, but they do so ungratefully, hissing and spitting at their sister.
The devil’s trap on the door has been repainted, but nothing else has been restored. It oozes neglect and abandonment, from the peeling walls to the floor carpeted in dirt and discarded needles. Junkies finding shelter, Dean assumes, until his gaze falls on the table. Fresh syringes, full of god alone knows what. Instruments of torture he thinks, and suddenly it’s hard to breathe all over again.
“Lady, you’re under a bed, not in a fucking fortress. If I wanted to kill you I’d just soak the bed in holy oil and light a match.” Dean doesn’t slur. He’s tipsy enough to smooth down the edges; he’s not too drunk to do his fucking job.
I’m pretending there is an IKEA near the bunker for narrative reasons please don’t @ me because I do not care.
Cas is in bed, proper bed. He’s been using it much more than the sofa-bed recently as his stamina kicks up and he’s able to stay awake for longer periods of time, get to bed under his own steam. He looks mostly asleep, and it’d be so easy for Dean to just slip under the covers and pretend none of this happened. But he doesn’t. He’s growing as a person, and as far as he’s concerned, all it’s doing is making his life so much more fucking difficult. Welcome to the real world.
“Let him.” Sam argues. “He’s an angel. It’s always good to go through the doors all guns blazing – means we can slip in less noticed, take out a few while they’re distracted.”
Nothing from Cas. He’s caught back in his pleasure/pain vortex as he hears Dean’s ecstatic groans, trying desperately to ignore them, tamp down the lust they’re stoking up and up. Lust that just fuels Lucifer even further, makes it harder for him to remember the point to this. Makes him just want to consume Dean in any way he can, fuck the plan, fuck it all – he just needs to shove his cock inside Dean, now, quick and brutal and so fucking satisfying.
“None of this is your fault, Dean.” Sam says, but in a hollow way, like he knows he might as well have said nothing for all the difference it’ll make.
“No. It was just shit that reminded you of them. What you have left of them is up here,” he points sloppily at Dean’s head “in your fucking memories. “ He pauses for a moment, remembers something. “Except Cas knew that wouldn’t be good enough for you. He spent fucking hours sifting through that rubble trying to find bits of those photographs that’d survived for you. Did you know that?”
. Not against what he’s been through. I can deal with this on my own. I don’t need him, or fucking you getting involved!”
What Sam delivers isn’t a conventional first aid kit by any standards, but it does. Cas uses the skills that Dean taught to him, with a tired smile and a muttered, “just in case.”
He used Dean’s face and voice and body to get off. Dean who won’t pick up his calls, who never wants to see him again, most likely. He fucked Dean over, but he’s still okay to use him for this.
“Of course not. You think I want to make an enemy of the Winchesters? Besides, I have a little pet project I’m working on, can’t just abandon it and go on the run.”
Sam makes a huffing noise, that one people do to signify they’ve heard your comment and they know it was meant to be funny, but it’s not quite enough to properly laugh at.
Dean doesn’t blanche, even though he knows private means small, and small means not safe. In his head, anyway.
He grunts in response, like he hasn’t really considered the possibility. She doesn’t call bullshit, and he’s grateful for that. This is a judgement free, sympathy free, emotional bullying free zone. You are allowed to have emotions in the zone, you are not allowed to try and force other people to.
“Your room was destroyed. All your stuff, all Dean’s stuff – I haven’t had a chance to do a proper search, but it doesn’t look good. At a glance I’d say it’s all gone.”
“Guidance?” Sam asks. He’s been very quiet, that ferocious brain of his pounding along at a hundred miles an hour, bouncing from hypothesis to conclusion and not liking any of it.
Next down is the Khaleesi Cocktail, which is literally the colour of blood and looks like the coolest shit ever. Along with it gets put a stoppered glass bottle in the shape of a skull with a thin layer of cocktail at the bottom and thick, white smoke filling the rest.
His legs don’t support him, and he ends up back on the floor, with Sam pressing Ruby’s knife into his back.
Thing is, experience has taught Dean that it’s very rarely paranoia, but rarely isn’t always. He needs someone to talk to, sound this out with. And if it just so happens that the only person he can do that with right now is the bells and whistles unrequited love of his life, well, bully for him.
Dean walks over to the bed, expecting to see something, a clue or a hint. A great big teasing fuck you. There’s nothing significant – just a depression, like someone has slept here recently-ish. There are a few short, dark hairs on the pillow. It doesn’t really mean anything. Not anything conclusive, anyway.
Cas can feel the pressing, anxious weight before he even opens his eyes. A sense of expectation, excitement turned sour.
Cas is momentarily thrown by the chance of location, the sensation of being flung across the planet on someone else’s wings – he understands now, why Dean didn’t like it. It’s nauseating, and Lucifer knows this. He likes to use it to unbalance Cas – will take even the smallest of excuses to stretch his scorched wings and fly.
He folds over, so his head rests against his legs, takes in deep, gulping breaths. And of course, of course that pulls up another little string of bile from his stomach. He can taste the vomit in his mouth, wonders how much he’s done this over the last three months. It’s all been a blur, an ouroboros of agony and ecstasy .
“If you know what I’m going to argue then why are you still saying you won’t do it!” Sam snaps, regrets it when Cas flinches and then laughs bitterly. A gleam in his eye that Sam really doesn’t like. He feels the need to reach for a bottle of windex, ready for black blood and a mouth unhinging with far too many teeth.
He does a little surprised head jerk, winces. Charlie realises she should probably clarify. She has a flare for the dramatic and she’s been having a stressful few weeks. So sue her.
It freaked Dean out, seeing that. More than he’s felt able to say, to show. Sure, Cas is weaker and jumpier than he used to be, but he was still Cas. Still tough as shit and unfazed by most anything. Except he’s not, is he. He’s fragile on the fucking inside as well as the outside and maybe it goes a lot deeper than Dean thought. Maybe the progress he thought they’d been making was just goddamn cosmetics.
From the crater there flies a hooded crow. It strikes more fear into Dean than anything else would – if some great horned or fanged horror had erupted from the earth in thunder of hooves and teeth. He’s faced down gods and monsters, angels and demons. It’s always the smallest, least assuming creature that holds the most danger. You just need to look at their own holy tax accountant to see that.
“Dean?” Cas’s tone is worried, and yeah, of course it’d be. All he has to go on is a garbled prayer and the fucking state of Dean, sitting in a dark alley by himself. He’s not even drinking to drown his problems. Is that progress, or a sign of something really fucked up?
“This wasn’t an opportunistic crime.” Cas’s tone sharpens. “It was meticulous, even by angelic standards. Apocalypses have been less carefully considered. If you’d been with me on that day he would have waited until you weren’t. He had all the time between the day I became human and the day I died to take me. Eventually I would have been on my own and off my guard – I didn’t think I had anything to be afraid of, then.”
In the three days he’s been resting here, he has come up with the same amount of plans. Three is a divine number, a good one. And to perform one act of creation a day is God’s way. Cahor had always followed God’s way.
For someone who barely seemed to know Cas in life, she’s taking an awful interest in his death. Sam is grateful, it means he doesn’t have to make the decisions, he can just let her and Charlie get on with it. And he finds that he trusts Rowena – or maybe he just trusts Charlie to notice if she starts getting up to anything peculiar.
“I thought you’d seen through that a long time ago. I was never going to fight Amara. Choose your battles, Castiel – that’s one I know I won’t win. Besides, you really think that God is going to let his little baby sister unpick the whole of his creation? Unlikely.”
Cas wishes Sam’d just spit whatever it is out so he can go to sleep. He’s not sure whether he voices this out loud or not, doesn’t really care.
He squeezes it tight in his grip and pulls it out, into sight. The creature looks cosmetically human; female, dark skin and thick, curly hair. There’s a feral cut to her mouth though, predatory expression in her eye that hints at something more dangerous.
“It’s okay. You don’t have to make excuses. I understand. And I’ll keep my distance, hunt for Amara, not bother you until I can be of use. Until I can prove I’m worthy of your trust.”
And if he doesn’t run but doesn’t let Cas do this, well, more of the same. The fucking tree on his back continues to grow, gain more power over him. It can already make him hallucinate in the waking world, what the fuck else will it do once it’s managed, somehow, to neutralise the Mark.
It’s all he has a chance to say before Dean’s bullets slice into the muscle of his legs and suddenly Dean is on him, woefully unprepared – without his demon killing knife, without an angel blade or holy oil. If this guy is human, he’s fine. If he’s anything else, well. All he can do is slow the fucker down. Dean knows this, in his rational brain. Unfortunately his rational brain isn’t the one in charge right now. All he knows is furious rage and a dead cold certainty that he can’t allow this son of a bitch to ever get near Cas again.
Sam’s phone starts to ring. It’s so unexpected that they stop arguing, both turn to stare at it. That’s the special, white noise static ringtone that signals Hannah is trying to contact them.
Cas tenses, like he expects to be attacked. Sam plans to stay still until he relaxes, but as the minutes wear on and Cas is still rigid, he realises that isn’t going to happen.
“Not much internet there.” He confirms, like he’s just coming to understanding, like he hasn’t known this all along.
He can feel Dean’s gaze flick to him, catches his eye and tries to will him to just not fucking go there, because all it’s gonna do is start a fight he can’t afford to lose, but really doesn’t have the strength for.
Joe greets her with an awkward little wave. He still doesn’t quite understand this whole angel business, but it’s important to Caroline, so it’s important to him. She smiles back at him, and then her mouth opens and a thin stream of silvery light flows out of it and up into the sky.
By the time they arrive he’ll be clean, redressed in Sam’s too big clothes to hide his wounds. Hannah might find out their extent when she heals him, but Dean never has to know. Dean never
“So, we know he’s upset, we know he was, at one point, heading east. What does that tell us?” Dean asks.
He’s not Dean, but he can do a little bit of Dean’s job for him, fill in until the real deal gets back.
Dean pays, takes his change and watches as Cas accepts two steaming boxes of popcorn without so much as flinching, carrying them back to the car.  You wouldn’t know only yesterday it’d been panic and angels everywhere.
But Sam isn’t paying attention. He’s noticed the phone on the table, screen lighting up as it receives a snapchat.
“I—” Fuck, it shouldn’t be this hard. “I can’t, I’m sorry. Not right now. I’m not, I’m too tired to think.”
“Dreaming about smacking me across the face, buddy?” he mouths in an undertone, so quiet he can barely hear it himself. “Charming.”
If Cas had spat that he’d never loved him, Dean would know he was just trying to hurt him – punish him.
“I’ll do it now,” Cas says, finally looking up and realising that whatever Sam has up his ass about this will only be calmed  by doing what he wants.
He lays Cas out on the backseat, kneels there beside him, strokes a hand through his hair and presses their foreheads together. He stays there for a long time, trying to make himself stand, force out the words that are setting in his throat like concrete.
He laughs, but that doesn’t stop him wanting to go over there and twitch up Dean’s shirt, fucking check.
“Traditionally this is done with metal spikes. You’ve annoyed me, though, so I’m going to use something a little more, uh, splintery. Less accurate, more fun.”
He settles himself on Cas’s lap and takes his face in his hands. Cas is looking up at him with a little smile, just sincere enough not to be called a smirk. He mouths something at Dean, but he doesn’t catch it. It’s not an instruction to stop though, so he can’t really bring himself to care too much.
“I wasn’t sure. You stopped breathing, I was going to try and resuscitate you, but then the Mark started glowing and you opened your eyes, I convinced myself I imagined it, or that it was a trick of my failing senses.”
This time the memory Lucifer shunts into Dean’s head isn’t his own. It was a delicate thing, extracting this from Sam’s mind in the moments before he expired, but it’s going to be worth it. Watching Sam fall apart through Lucifer’s eyes would hurt Dean, sure. But this, this is the crowning glory. Living Sam’s death with him, well. It’s going to destroy Dean, totally and utterly.
Dean wakes up in an unfamiliar room. He’s used to that. What he’s less used to is the pain. Sure, he wakes up in pain a lot, a dull niggling ache from this injury or that, sharp, itching bite of a healing stab wound, that sort of thing. This is much worse, agony settled deep in his bones – so relentless he’s not even sure he can pinpoint the particular source, or if it the source just happens to be every goddamn nerve ending in his body and maybe a few borrowed from other people too.
He doesn’t often deepthroat people. Like, he gets how it’s good for the person sticking their cock down your throat, but from the other end, well, he’s never really seen the appeal. He doesn’t actively
Cas claws his way back to some semblance of situational awareness just to brokenly spit out the same tired plea. He’ll be wishing he hadn’t in a moment, be wishing he was still just trapped in a mess of frenzied sensation.
It is Cas, just about. He’s dishevelled, barely able to hold himself upright. Shit. He should be in bed, not hauling his ass around out here, tearing himself to pieces.
He snorts. “So what. Didn’t stop me from diving straight for the bottle the minute things got rough.”
Cas’s hands lift up to stroke at Dean’s neck, and Dean kisses him hungrily, able to tell by Cas’s faltering rhythm that he’s about to come. Cas takes Dean’s cock in hand, doesn’t even have to start pumping it before Dean’s shuddering, coming over his chest in a crescendoing wave of bliss.
Sam watches her go with a sad, fond look. Dean didn’t know how close he was to the truth when he lashed out, and yeah, he probably shouldn’t be dividing his attention when the apocalypse is knocking at the gates. But hell, what the fuck is the point in saving the world if you don’t take out a few hours a week to fucking appreciate someone who makes it worth it.
“Yeah, well. Keep the ball in your hand maybe? That way it’ll still be able to take the damage for you.”
He wants to throw it across the room in rage, but he doesn’t, because it’s Sam’s property and he doesn’t want to break it – and also because he wants to behave, because if he behaves then maybe he gets this fucking cuff off sooner. It didn’t bother him too much at first, he was used to it, but now every scratch and chafe reminds him that he’s no better than a fucking dog, tied up here, not trusted.
There’s a woodstove in one corner, next to a surprisingly large TV. It looks out of place in the rustic charm, but then again, Dean supposes that there isn’t much to do here if it decides to fucking piss it down with rain. They might be glad of it later.
He’s hurting, and Cas doesn’t know how to deal with it, is still so new to real and vivid human emotions. He tries, though, settles them into a comfortable position, curls his hand gently into Dean’s hair.
Dean tries to voice these thoughts aloud, stumbles and trips over his own tongue, “Sam wouldn’t I – no. He couldn’t have.”
“Okay, okay. I’m coming.” He heaves himself to his feet, feeling the strain on his jeans and hoping he doesn’t pop a button. He would never fucking live it down.
Well, he gets his explanation, and then he gets to watch them minutely posturing, trying to get the edge, to be the one to die so their brother might live – and suddenly all he can hear is white noise. Hissing, crackling static jumps along his bones and between his ears and he can’t bear it.
He charges out, tries to open the door and realises there’s a weapon, a knife, covered in fresh dripping blood, clasped in his right hand. He tries to drop it but it’s stuck there, glued with gore and flesh and drying innards. He forces the door open, runs outside, following the howls.
“Now I believe we were having a conversation about the almost definitely evil tree on your back, before you side-tracked it with a chick-flick moment.”
“He covered us with his own body, while sigils and bricks were flying around, stayed there until it stopped. Some of those were anti-angel sigils. How do you think that felt, crouched there, over us, being torn apart, so that we’d stay safe?”
Turns out it hadn’t been that much of a problem. She should have known really, just follow the trail of freaky shit.
“What happened?” He croaks, barely able to get the words out in disconnected panic. “What did he do to you?”
“I don’t think I’ve ever seen Sam so carefree. It was like he was a normal kid again – 100% normal, no lingering Winchester fear or bullshit hanging about him. And I was running up and down the sand with him, because it was fun, not because I was keeping an eye on him. We made fucking sandcastles, we dug great big holes until it was too wet to go any further. We even played a prank on Bobby. He went to piss and we dug a hole under where his towel was, like a little pitfall trap a few inches deep, laid it back over hoping you couldn’t tell.
Sam plans his moment carefully, waits until they’re on the highway, speeding along too fast for Dean to just stop the car and bail. Corners him, effectively, which yeah dick move, but also the only goddamn thing likely to get him more than a disappearing act that leaves him stranded without a car.
And yeah, he’s family. But, but it was the fucking look in his eyes. Desperate, wild, almost unhinged. Not a calculated move, one on reflex, because you couldn’t help yourself.
“I love him.” Dean says. “And I wish I didn’t. I wish he’d never come back, that he’d just fucking stayed in heaven where he was safe and an angel and fucking okay. I can’t fucking do this. I can’t watch him strung out and high. I can’t watch him overdose and
Cas is crying again, only this time he’s not sure he minds it. You’re supposed to cry in situations like this, it’s not just his body taking one more high velocity dump on him from a great height.
Someone grabs him by the arm and tries to restrain him. He puts up some semblance of a fight, trying to crush his attacker against the wall and then he gives up, allowing them to lower him to the ground.
He swallows down the urge to pitch the glass across the room. His violent impulses have done enough goddamn damage for today. It’s a struggle, he’s not sure he remembers how to express his emotions in a healthy way. He’d been trying, been doing his best to learn – but really, what’s a few months of trying to grow into a real person verses a lifetime of booze and violence.
“So lemme get this straight,” Dean snarls, “someone threatens to come and brain-spike you into joining a cult, you kill them, and then you just stay sat in the same house, what, waiting here for us? Like I’m gonna fucking believe that.”
And breaking out the whiskey would be lying prone on that same road while the wheels of oncoming cars thundered over him and crushed his bones to paste.
Cas submits, allowing Dean to gently clean the wounds and bandage them up. He wouldn’t describe the feeling itself as nice – more painful and itchy – but the care that Dean does it with, the tender concentration on his face. It makes it bearable.
The final rocket goes off, a vivid burst of colour and noise. Cas turns to Dean to say something, express his wonder in some way, but Dean’s not looking at the sky. He’s looking at Cas, smiling nearly as widely as Cas is.
“Sam said you two were here, playing without me, but I didn’t believe him. That kind of betrayal, in my own bunker? No way, not from you two.”
Dean is loath to admit it, but, well, he’s noticed a bit of a change in Sam recently, and it worries him. The whole tragic martyr with no future crap ain’t a good look on anyone. Formerly optimistic, Sam ‘I’m gonna get out of this life one day’ Winchester, especially.
They untangle and hurry to the toilet. Dean gets back to the car first, shortly followed by Sam, who lobs the keys at him and folds his unnaturally large frame into the back seat. Dean settles himself in the front, guns the engine and pulls out of their parking space.
Sam leaves Charlie attempting to stack an implausible amount of boxes into her arms and makes his way back to the bunker, trying to decide whether he can get away with sneaking past Dean and Cas and just collapsing face-first into bed, or whether he really should at least say hello first.
The damage is still there, but the source, the toxic sludge dissolving him from the inside, has been wiped away. It won’t get any worse from here. It might even, if he’s really lucky, get better. He can already feel his body trying to knit itself back together, deep in its core.
You live elbow to elbow with a guy like they have for as long as they have, you learn them pretty well.
The woman slaps the money down on the table, scuttles off in a flustered rush before Claire can even make a token effort at rejecting it.
He climbs up a treehouse ladder and ends up in a hollowed out trunk, which he wanders aimlessly around until he finds himself, logically, in a shoelace factory. He briefly entertains designing and buying some custom shoelaces. Realises that is probably the actual lamest thing he has ever thought in his life and beats a hasty retreat.
“I, Orcus, punisher of broken oaths, hereby agree not to run off with this contract.” Orcus snaps its fingers and a red, sulphurous spark jumps up and then sinks back into its hand. “Sufficient?”
Maybe he’s overreacting a little, it’s just a beer. Not even spirits or anything hard. Just one beer. It just felt, something. Like he was letting Cas down. Like he was being disrespectful, drinking when Cas was off the, y’know. Stuff. He doesn’t know if it’s okay, if Cas would mind, or if it’d make things harder for him having Dean there swigging from a bottle. Like, Sam must know, Sam’s the one who usually thinks about these things, and he still bought the beer.
Killing the first angel alerts the second, a tall and imposing type who manages to put out that impression in spite of the actual stature of her vessel. There’s something huge about her, and Dean gets the feeling she’s no ordinary guard. She wasn’t put here because she’s expendable, she was put here because fucking no-one is getting past her.
“I woke up and I couldn’t find you. There was howling, I was following it, because, because you were there, and then I could see the bunker, and I fell. There was this stuff, like tar, it burned my hands, down to the bone in places.”
They pick their way through the wreckage, following the trail of destruction to the library. Smoke billows through the door as Cas throws it open, enough that Dean coughs and chokes, blinded.
Dean trusts Cas. He can’t help it. It’s written into him now, into the fucking fabric of him. Cas is family, and even when Cas screws up, that’s fine, he’ll always be welcomed back into the fold. There’s almost nothing too big for Dean to hold it against him.
Dean shrugs. “We’re taking it slow. He’s still a hundred kinds of shook up – I mean, Jesus, it’s been weeks and we’ve just about hit hand holding.”
“How attached are you to your wheels?” Dean asks the next morning, and Sam shrugs in response. “We’ll take mine, then. No point driving both.”
