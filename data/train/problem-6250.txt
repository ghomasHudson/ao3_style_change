'Oh,' Tony said. He had never realised he had a housekeeper, although now that he thought about it, things did have a habit of tidying themselves away when he wasn't looking. He'd honestly never really thought about it. 'You must be new?' He added, hopefully.
But it was fine, Tony told himself. It was easy. Save the kid, and the Captain would be so grateful he would tumble into bed with him without crying all over his covers.
Rounding on Stone in disgust, Steve shook his head and said, 'Right. Well maybe a few nights in the cell with cool you off.'
Okay, they could deal with that. Steve always got a little grumpy when they had to work through a media circus, but unless he was saying
'Currently unknown, sir. However, the officer stated that eye witnesses declared that the aircraft came
Miss Friday was in a coma for seven years. When she did finally wake up, helped along by some Oscorp medical tech, her mind didn't come with her. She was doolally. Gaga. Tony visited exactly once, and never went back. She died of a stroke at age 53, having lived not much of a life at all. The blame lay solely at Norman Osborn's door.
For some reason he had imagined the process of the Charity Marriage would take a long time to get through, but it had been less than a week since they had posted the profile and they were already on stage three. Almost as soon as his mom had responded to Howard Stark's original message, she had been invited to come and meet him in person at Stark Industries two days later.
, but then he realised to his horror that he was wallowing and made an appointment with a counsellor the same day.
Apparently she was also immune to cold. Steve was sitting directly below the air conditioning vent, which he was almost sure she had deliberately turned up higher than any sane person would reasonably inflict on another. It was also making the air very dry. He used his inhaler, noisily. She kept glaring at him, no longer even pretending to work. Steve met her gaze, and took another puff.
One of the cars that the monster had thrown had slid on its side right up against the front step and Peter scuttled behind it, peering round the edge to see if anyone had noticed. They hadn't. So far so good. But now came the tricky part, because the driveway was really long and there wasn't much to hide behind. He was just thinking that he would have to make a straight run for it after all when he realised that the fence came pretty close to the house, maybe like 10 feet. If he used his powers, climbed up on top of the car and along it, he could probably jump onto the top of the fence and climb over it before anyone noticed. He had powers now. He knew he could make it.
'Nothing,' his dad said, which was another non-answer. Peter decided the best way to make him feel better was a cuddle, so he clambered off the bed and onto his dad's lap, snuggling into his chest. His dad wrapped his arms around him.
'I wouldn't want to damage your fine establishment by misrepresenting myself,' Bucky said, reaching for the band, but The Diva held it teasingly away.
Also it is not proof read, mostly because I didn't plan to post this today. Unfortunately as I was finishing off what was meant to be today's offering my laptop cut out and I lost half of what I wrote. >.< So in the name of getting something up, this! Please forgive any typos, and the fact I don't have any of the usual snowed in tropes. As always, enjoy!
'Alright, Deputy, sorry to keep you waiting,' Steve said, as he breezed back into the office. 'That all seems to be in order. Good to have you on board.'
Something in the back of his mind associated the words with Tony Stark, who, now that Steve thought about it, had seemed pale and exhausted during their brief conversation that morning. The thought made him ask, 'Did something happen with Stark recently?'
Captain,' he supplied. 'Often erroneously referred to as 'Santa Buddy' due to the changes made to the chorus.'
'I don't like dating people with kids,' Stark clarified. 'Too complicated. Too many little... variables. You're the exception.'
'Fine, I guess I promised to be good.' He paused emphatically. 'As long as you want me to be, anyway.'
'Sorry, miss,' Osborn said, still looking at Tony. 'I just worry about the damage he'll cause, in here all alone.'
'Flying cars?' Tony smirked. One of Steve's biggest disappointments on coming to the future, he knew, was that cars still didn't fly. At least, not everyone's did.
. But there was no way she was barging past Cap to get to the bathroom, not with him standing there looking so...
this. It was fact, indisputable fact, that the Binders couldn't do anything to you without your consent; and fact too that there were hundreds, thousands,
Bucky winced. 'Can you please not make jokes about the ever present spectre of death hanging over you?' He squeezed Steve's shoulder. 'It's alright for you. You'd be dead. I'd be the one left here doing the grieving thing.'
'Nice to meet you,' Steve said, and didn't feel guilty that it came out sounding a little sarcastic.
Peggy cocked her head, thinking. 'Tall, yes. Curvaceous, no. Legs, not particularly noticeable. Brunette with a cocksure grin and plenty of swagger, laughing eyes...'
'Don't. I'm okay. I have a lot of therapy.' Then he frowned. 'Wait, do I still get therapy when I'm in proper jail? I don't know how jail works. Do I have to join a prison gang? I mean, that's assuming I can find one that will take me, goodness knows I will probably be the only rich white guy in there. This country is seriously broken, I mean have you seen-'
. The word sent Tony's pulse racing. He didn't know how to be himself, not on his own, not as a singular. He couldn't, he couldn't do this alone, he didn't know how to
, his Steve, writing some kind of stream-of-conciousness love letter. Because he knew Steve's love language. He'd learnt early on that being given compliments made Steve uncomfortable and embarrassed and flustered, and that asking him to try and give one, especially based on looks, was just about his worst nightmare. Tony had learnt that Steve showed his love in the little things, in getting up early to make the coffee, in learning to sleep with a white noise machine because Tony preferred it, on coming home from a mission with a kit bag full of Tony's favourite hot sauce, because the recipe had changed in the US but not in Europe. He took note of the way Steve looked at him when he wore a particularly fine suit. And Tony had gotten used to it. He'd learnt to appreciate the gestures and looks for what they represented, had attempted to show his love to Steve in the same way, and had tried to bury his yearning for actual, vocalised expressions of affection. He probably only felt like he needed them because he had been denied them so often as a child, blah, blah, psychologist's goldmine, blah.
'Definitely not Bucky, who wouldn't let anyone sit in your seat at lunch,' Sam said, smiling. 'For real though, I'm glad to see you back. You doing okay?'
'So I gathered, given that he told me you tackled him and tied him to a chair!' She shook her head. 'I really thought you had more sense than this, Captain.'
'Yes, but I didn't sleep for three days on that mission, that means I get to sleep for three days now.'
Later, the door opened. Then the curtains opened. Tony moaned in protest. The sun being let in meant time would move again.
Despite the low number of genuine Charity Marriages, the descriptor 'Dime Marriage' remains in popular use, particularly as a derogatory term towards marriages where there is a large
, was “Uuuuuuuuuh, lilies?”.’ The guests would laugh, and so would Tony, and Steve would blush; but Tony would squeeze his hand and Steve would smile.)
‘Visiting,’ he said, coming inside. ‘Well, actually, I’m taking you out. Terrible security on this building, by the way. Anyone can just waltz in. Where’s Peter?’
Slowly, Tony removed his jacket, shirt and tie. There was no rush, and they would only get creased if he didn't lay them just so across the back seat. Once he had stripped down to nothing but his flight suit, he reached beneath his seat for the briefcase that disguised the Iron Man armour.
Note: The song referenced (and somewhat exaggerated) here is 'I Believe in a Thing Called Love' by the Darkness, which you should all listen to if you haven't already :)
Every other week, when he was allowed visitors, Steve came. Eleven AM on the dot, he would be sitting and waiting, and ask the same question: 'So, how are you doing?'. He was the one that persuaded Tony to use the therapy. They both agreed Peter should not come visit, but the little boy wrote to Tony every day without fail. Sometimes the letters were about science, or about something interesting he'd found out, or what he and Steve had been doing. Once it was the entire script of
have happened with some random guy texting your kid. And if you’re mad about what could have happened, you’re mad at yourself, not me.’
'I'm sorry, Steve, really.' Dr Moore paused, then said, 'Oh, Steve Rogers, I never noticed that. Coincidence, or are you named after him?'
'Do not tell them that,' Steve said, dragging Bucky through the thick scented curtain and into the bar itself.
Peter nodded, white faced, and turned his attention to the phone, which was exactly what Steve wanted. The truth was, he would have killed Venom if he'd had the chance, and he wouldn't have had any regrets. But Venom wasn't a threat for this exact second at least, and although he wasn't sure about the wisdom of trusting them with whatever Venom was, Shield would at least be able to contain it in its current state. He could go and help them in a moment, and a moment was all Steve needed.
As of 2015(6), Charity Marriages are believed to account for less than 3% of all marriages in the US and less than 1% of marriages worldwide, although similarities have been noted to other arranged marriage customs such as
Another eternal pause. How long did it take to breathe? Tony hadn't breathed at all for at least five minutes.
'I can't,' Steve said, more reluctant than he'd ever been in his life to go to work. 'I said I'd take the first duty.'
his neck and a red head on the other, idly stroking his chest as she watched Steve without any interest. Steve felt his mouth dry out. Were they high? This was a bad idea.
Impatient, he brushed the thought aside. He didn't care about the kid. There was nothing he could do about it, so it wasn't going to become part of his life. The kid was just a means to an end. Of course, Tony had realised the Captain wasn't going to play ball and sleep with him on the first date, but he didn't mind toying with him for a while. It might even make a nice change of pace. He had started having dreams again in the last few days; not necessarily bad dreams, but an unsettling change from the years of empty sleep he had enjoyed. A little challenge in his waking life might be just what he needed. He'd have the Captain in the end.
Tony laughed and carried on, leaving Steve to hurry after him, a smile breaking over his face. The truth was he loved horses. He always had, and many times as a kid he had been shooed away by an irritated grocer or milkman or dustman for fussing the horses while they were meant to be working. He'd been just the right age to see them replaced one by one as cars became more affordable, and these days seeing horses made him nostalgic for the time when they had been an every day sight.
As soon as he was back in uniform, Steve felt better. They'd given him the access code to the chest soon after he had woken up, telling him all his personal effects that had come out of the ice with him were inside there, but as Steve knew that would only mean the uniform, the shield and his dog tags he had never opened it. Captain America had been a symbol of a different place, a different time, that had been lost to him forever. Steve had never planned to put it back on, and had felt far happier in the uniform of a standard Shield Agent, not standing out, just one of the team, no different to anyone else.
He tapped on the glass. Steve looked up, registered it was him, and looked somewhat surprised as he strode over to open the door.
'I tried to get out of it,' Tony said, desperately. 'I tried to get a deal. But he wanted to carry on and meet anyway.'
Hesitating wasn't going to do any good. He kicked off his shoes so he could get a better grip, pressed his stinging hands against the wall and started to climb. The glass was smooth, and it made it harder for him to hold on, but he could do it. He was going to climb all the way to the top, find his dad, and get him to let him in through a window so they could save Mr Stark together.
Steve pushed a hand back through his hair in frustration. It was getting long again, and any day now he would go and get it cut back to his usual regulation length. Tony liked it both ways, and normally he would make the most of the rare times it was like this – especially now it was all dishevelled and rumpled – but it so wasn't the time. 'What am I supposed to have done?' He demanded, as if Tony hadn't already screamed it at him five times.
'I hate to tell you this, Clementine, but they're talking already.' Tony shrugged. 'But with any luck I have a solution for that- oh, here we go.'
Tony’s small smile against his skin, could almost feel his breath on his cheek. Which was more than could be said for Steve’s own breath, which seemed to have stopped completely. Judging by the burning in his cheeks, nowhere else was getting a blood supply. He might suffocate because of that smile. He might faint. And if what Steve thought
'Uh, plenty.' Tony called back. The flow coming from the stairs seemed unending. But this was good. If they got rid of everyone here, the rest of the facility would be unguarded. Only Cap was shaking his head. He didn't seem to agree.
future! He is dying! Haven't you caused enough suffering in your miserable little life?! When was the last time anyone else genuinely wanted to spend time with you?! Would one good deed, making one dying little boy happy for ten minutes, cost you so much?! What the hell is wrong with you?!'
'Really? Not 'How are you still alive, you were born in 1918' or 'Where have you been for 70 years?''
He was so quick off the mark that he arrived at the state of the art lab suite before the previous group had emptied out of it. He bounced up and down impatiently, peering into the room. It was the top ability group in there, so hopefully they would pack away quickly. Well, top ability other than him. They'd given up trying to teach Tony anything about science just over two years ago, a few months after his arrival at the school, when it had become apparent that he knew more about it than the teacher.
. When he pressed them, they all agreed that he had been acting oddly during those months, not quite himself, but it was only in retrospect that they'd realised it was a sign he'd already been growing sick. His doctors told him not to worry about it, not to try and push himself into remembering, but they didn't know how frustrating it was to constantly feel as if the memories were just out of sight, round the corner or behind a wall, and not be able to reach them. If he had been bound, he wouldn't even have the glimpses; just a white fog of nothing. And now his teachers wanted him to pretend to be someone who volunteered for that? It was insensitive at best. He threw the assignment aside.
'Cap, I know who this is, okay?' He hurried to catch up with Steve's purposeful march. 'We'll get him back, I swear.' They were out of the hospital now, striding across the car park. Steve nodded.
Neither of them mentioned Iron Man. Steve wondered how much Stark made taking on hit jobs for other people. A silent waiter appeared at his elbow then, putting plates down in front of them. There had been no menu involved. Either Stark always ate the same thing or, again, he had ordered in advance.
The man was a stranger. Taller even than Steve himself was, with his fair hair worn long between his wide-brimmed hat and dark cloak. More than that, he was almost as wide as he was tall, built solid as a wall, muscles clear even from this distance. He turned at the sound of Steve's approach and smiled widely, holding a hand out to greet him.
saved him, and so had Mr Stark. They had both saved him, and now they were both in trouble, and now Peter had to help them, even though everyone said no. After all, Peter had watched the Captain America documentary – the
The town square, when they reached it, was transformed. The market stalls were out, festooned in flags and garlands of summer flowers, piled with trinkets and souvenirs, mingled with the bright colours of carnival games and the odours of a dozen different kinds of food. In the middle, a space for the dancing was marked out by wooden posts, the band up on a scaffolding-type stage at one end, already playing. What made it magical, however, was the electric lighting strung up all around.
But now, he wanted to stand out. He wanted Osborn to know exactly who he had crossed and what he was facing. Most importantly, Steve wanted the shield. It was sitting in the bottom of the chest, shining as if it had been lovingly polished just hours before, waiting for him to pick it up.
But he was just being paranoid, because ever since he had started on this symbiotic relationship his course of action had always been clear, and now he wasn't sure. Things would return to normal as soon as he finished his plan and made the Captain his, at least for a night or two. Step One towards that end was to fix Peter, who was so little and so kind and so excited by science and idolised Tony and didn't deserve-
Thor was good at his job. Maybe even a little better than Steve would have liked; these days Thor had been out and come back with whatever bandit needed rounding up before Steve had even managed to holster his gun with his stiff hand. The residents of Timely, Steve had noticed, were increasingly seeking to come to Thor rather than him, and he tried desperately not to be jealous. The important thing was that justice was done and the citizens were protected, but it was a bit of a hard mouthful to swallow, feeling like a spare part in your own office.
Peter looked at the door. This must have been the program Mr Stark had told him about. 'Are you Jarvis?'
'I'm sorry,' Steve said, putting his key into the lock but not turning it yet. 'I wasn't expecting anyone.'
And then the sprinklers opened, and everything was drenched. Tony spluttered, and then laughed. Jarvis was undoubtedly back, and his relief was immense. Even as Steve came out, looking alarmed, to see what was going, Tony began to feel better. It was almost as if the water was waking him up after a long, long sleep, washing all of it away. He wasn't sure what the world was going to be like, without Venom. He wasn't sure what sort of man he would be.
The moment they rounded the corner onto the corridor that led to Peter's room, Steve started to run. He moved so fast, he was running before Tony had even processed what was wrong; which turned out to be that there were three bodies in the corridor. There were two nurses and a woman Tony recognised to be Doctor Moore, the lead on Peter's case. But she wasn't dead. Tony knew what dead looked like, and a quick feel of her neck confirmed she was only unconscious. He could smell it now, the traces of chemical lingering in the air, some sort of knock out gas that the military probably would have been very interested in once, long ago.
'It isn't fun,' Steve replied, unable to keep from smiling as Tony followed him to lean against the post just at the corner of the dance floor, by the band. 'And people will talk.'
'One result, sir,' Jarvis said, pulling it up on a holographic display near Tony's elbow. Tony looked at it, eyes widening. He'd just struck gold.
There were no lights on as he crossed the marble floor of what must have been the lobby, back when the place was still used as Stark Industries headquarters with just a few residential floors on the top. As Steve passed through, peering through the glass partitions at the abandoned offices, he realised there was no dust. The whole place looked completely sterile, as if nobody had ever been there. The only sign of life in the whole place was the soft glow of light from the elevator shaft, showing that that, at least, was operational. The penthouse, then. Steve went and pressed the call button.
Apparently realising that there was no way Steve was about to climb into his lap, Stark seemed to lose interest, taking his glass from the table and knocking back the dregs of whatever was inside it instead.
'Save it,' Tony cut him off. 'Really, don't worry. Good to be on the same page.' He suddenly let out a bitter laugh. 'You couldn't just lie for once, could you?'
Steve wrenched the pushchair round. Peter was slumped in the straps, his head sagging onto his chest, his eyes closed and body limp. Steve tipped his chin up, rushing too much to be gentle, holding his hand up against Peter's lips.
'Damn,' he said, looking him up and down. The girls giggled. 'Be my guest.' He gestured benevolently at the chair on the opposite side of the table as if he owned the place. Steve did not like his expression one bit, but he sat anyway. He just had to get straight down to business.
'Is that the best you got?' He laughed. 'Toys!' And one of the tentacles smashed through the ranks, sweeping them aside like a car crashing through a wheat field. He dropped the first two agents he had grabbed. They were both dead.
‘Maybe,’ Steve said. ‘But people don’t tend to want, I don’t know, Venus fly traps, in their bouquets.’
'The whole building must have been rigged,' Natasha was saying, unaware of the grappling that was going on at their end. 'They blew the whole thing. Ten square miles of labs and tunnels under the desert and they just blew it up like it was nothing.'
'You'd better hope he is, Steven,' Sarah said grimly. 'Because at the moment our best candidate is only interested if you turn into a woman.' Biting her lip in determination, she started clearing out the rest of the messages.
His hand pressed into something cold, and viscous, and definitely not stone. He might have thought it was algae or fungus, except that as soon as he touched it, it ran away. His hand was left pressed against stone, just like on the right.
As he grinned, Steve knew his own face was mirroring it right back. He loved that he could make Tony laugh. He loved that
Tony fell silent at last, looking at her. He was too used to being told he was 'too young' for things. His parents surely would never agree. And yet, Meredith said she would speak to them, and now she looked as if she was done talking. There was no 'but' in her expression.
At the familiar drawl, Steve twisted in the chair to look at him; unable to stop a slight smile tugging at the corner of his lips despite his frustration. Tony was a sight in the morning, hair tousled with sleep, his beard and moustache not yet shaved and combed back into their customary perfectly groomed shape, tie not yet in place and suspenders hanging loose down by his sides. It was a side of him no-one else got to see. Unfortunately, it meant Tony saw a side to Steve no-one else did too; and Tony had already figured out the cause of the early morning rage, his eyes drifting to Steve's trailing shoelaces.
Tony drank. By the time he was half way through the second bottle, he was feeling better. He wasn't so hot. His head was still heavy, but it was no longer spinning, and the ground seemed to have settled beneath him. His throat wasn't so painful. Even his heart rate was more under control. He could almost remember the way back, like it was there in his head ready, but every time he tried to think of it the thought would slip away again.
and Mr Stark said he wasn't worried about it, but said he wasn't going to release the cure for other kids, which his dad said meant he must be worried a little. He couldn't remember any more, just little sentences that didn't make sense on their own.
‘Can, can I help you with something?’ He stammered out. Part of him hoped Tony would say no, that he had just come in to say hi, but no. He was here to buy flowers. Of course he was. Why else would anyone come into a florist? Today, he said, he was buying pre-emptively.
at it. Draw inspiration. Try to see where it got its strength, and duplicate it; just as he was going to do with Osborn's experiments into insect strength and animal regeneration, with his Dad's pre-Chernobyl radiation-is-good-for-you notes, and with what he knew or guessed about what had made Steve, physically at least, into Captain America.
And yet, his father was just looking at him with something like pity in his eyes. 'You know it doesn't work unless the person being bound is willing,' he said, heavily. 'But you're not wrong. The truth is, I paid him to do it.'
'Romanov, what the hell is going on?' He asked. 'I thought you said he was done with Stark. I thought he understood.'
'It totally is, it's filled right to the top with lots of lovely vegetables and I'm going to make you eat them all.'
Tony had said, and Steve had given him a hard look. They knew from experience that their definitions of 'little' were quite different, but Tony had promised to keep it casual and in the end Steve had acquiesced. He wanted to celebrate, too.
He was getting into a black car with Jan and the rest of the original team line up, trying not to cry. He was rolling over to gather his wife into his arms. He was chasing after Tony, right out onto the streets of Timely, to tell him he loved him no matter who was watching. He was asking the cute barista for his number, allowing the alien to reach out and touch him so they could communicate, reaching up to get the books in the library for the hot guy on the engineering course, he was running backstage ignoring the cries for an encore in favour of seeking out the roadie he loved, he was lovingly reminding his ageing husband that they had already been married forty years when he was proposed to yet again, he was telling his king that he had saved him for reasons more than a knight's duty, he was taking Tony in his arms and kissing him, kissing him, kissing him -
Somewhere in the conversation, he had taken Steve's hand and Steve hadn't pulled away. Now Tony was leaning in towards him, and Steve somehow knew this was it, that his defences had finally crumbled away and no matter how dangerous it was, how selfish it was, he was going to kiss every inch of this man he could get his lips to, right here in the town jail.
'He was quite handsome,' his mom had said. 'Brown hair, lovely brown eyes. One of those little beards that just goes round, you know?'
. It was no wonder the kid was sick if he had grown up in a place like this. Tony felt ill just stopping there. He blared the horn.
'Well, here's one for the maybe pile,' Sarah said, scrolling down what looked to be a comparatively substantial message. 'This one is actually written by the parent. He wants a match for his heir, to keep the wealth in the family and safeguard against hostile corporate takeover, improve their reputation as a family firm committed to charity, blah blah – oh.
Tony laughed. This man was ridiculous. Then again, Steve wasn't the one lost with no idea how to get home. Tony wanted to cry.
'It's not fine,' Steve said. 'You haven't showered in six days, Tony. You stink. You can't brief us if everyone's fainting from the smell.'
, who was definitely behind the whole thing, were whooping and yelling and generally making a scene the likes of which his art school had never seen. They had a banner. Oh hell, did they have
Steve chanted in his head like a mantra. Sure, he had learnt to fly the jets – eventually – but spaceships were a bit outside of his skill set. He just needed a window.
Outside, the snow was still piled up against the door, but Tony no longer cared. All he needed was this moment, and if the snow lasted forever he wouldn't even care.
There was a loud, sizeable crowd of very young, very drunk, very scantily clad beautiful women in the back corner of the room. It seemed like his tip off may actually pay off. Suddenly wondering what he was going to say, Steve worked his way over to them between the tightly-packed tables. His passage didn't escape their notice, as the women turned to look at him. He began to feel a bit self-concious.
A huge thank you as always to everyone who commented! Your remarks keep me going (and make me feel guilty when I haven't written a chapter recently). Apparently my 'big reveal' last time was not as big as I thought, but this chapter should make everything clearer. You all rock my socks :) A special shout out has to go to devillygirl- You got it.... ;)
The alarms had gone off the moment Steve had touched the roof, and within seconds hoards of hired goons had poured out. The security had been increased considerably since Tony had last visited, which was a good sign that Peter was here. He fired off a couple of blasts, taking out two more guards.
The space wasn't huge, but it didn't change the fact that it was the most beautiful place Steve had ever been. Barnaby flipped a hidden switch near the doors and the place flooded with light; small footlights buried beneath plants, LEDs in the wooden walkways and trailed round the trellises. Truthfully, Steve had never been that interested in abstract art, but this garden was full of shapes; made of steel or stone or glass, all of them flowing like liquid, all of them catching the lights just right to seem alive. The plants and flowers had been perfectly chosen to compliment them, growing below and around and above and into them, the wind stirring them gently, releasing a delicate array of scents, making the whole place seem like a single breathing entity. It was possibly the most magical place he had ever been. Steve staggered onto a bench and sat, Barnaby coming to join him a moment later. Somewhere he could hear water running. There must be a pond or a waterfall tucked away someone he hadn't looked yet.
Tony stiffened, but Steve's gentle hands didn't even break their rhythm. Tony looked up at him. Steve had that expression again, that enraptured expression full of love, but this time he was looking at Tony.
But it had still hurt, and he hadn't been able to sleep properly, and everything was all mixed up in his head, and he knew he had heard his dad and Mr Stark talking and talking for
'Just shut up and enjoy the view, Cap,' Tony said, letting his head drop onto Steve's shoulder. Steve shuffled behind him.
His flight suit was starting to feel tight, restrictive. For the first time since they had joined, Tony wondered if he should take it off for a bit.
'No. No, I don't think so. You'll probably find he'll just have less and less energy, that his breathing will be more strained, until his heart and lungs give out and he... slips away. It shouldn't hurt him. If he complains of any pain, you would need to call for an ambulance right away.'
'Nice to meet you,' Steve had said, not meaning it. They'd shaken hands, which he had appreciated, it had made the meeting feel more normal. Still, he had sat stiffly on the edge of the couch, wondering if Richard was about to start making notes on his grip shaking hands or his choice of seat. Richard didn't.
'I know, I know, you're about to try and pass the name off as a big coincidence and tell me how much crap you got for it in the army, blah blah blah, and then I'm going to say bullshit, because it is, and we'll argue back and forth a bit but eventually you'll admit it because a, I'm right, and b, sorry, gorgeous, but I am way smarter than you and there is no way you could outwit me.'
Steve didn't answer. Instead he reached into the pocket of his coat, and pulled out a gun, old army issue. He set it down on the table with a click.
'Oh, we got the right Avenger.' The Skrull sneered. 'Normally our smallest infant could absorb one of your kind's tiny monkey brains with ease, but Stark is... different. He is an aberration. His thought pattern is totally erratic, unpredictable. We would not risk one of our kind trying to take his thoughts and memories in.'
Tony could almost hear the awful snap. He shook his head, vigorously, and pushed the thoughts aside. They were through the door, inside the building, running blindly down a set of stairs and into a corridor, filled with doors leading to unknown rooms. He had to save the bloodlust for later, save it for Osborn. Right now he had to focus on Peter.
‘Yes!’ Steve said, seizing on the idea. It sounded right. He took some blooms out of the rose bucket and placed them with the others on the counter.
As it turned out, no, they mustn't. Because it wasn't actually a world-ending scenario Rhodes had called him to, it was a wedding.
'Come on,' Stark urged, putting his hand on the small of his back and propelling him out. 'We're going. Now.'
'I don't even care any more. I was all like 'don't push them, let them figure it out, it's up to them to talk to each other', but you know what,
The tendrils that had grown out of his suit to fit around the door did not retreat, but remained, streaming around Stark like tattered clothes. If anything, they were growing thicker, and stronger. There were more of them too, not just from his fingers, but everywhere, a seething, roiling mass of black. Stark took up most of the hall now, knocking over vases and ornaments, bumping off doorframes, and it was all Steve could do to follow along in his wake.
‘Ten?’ Steve asked, taking a bite of his own food in the hope of encouraging Peter to do the same. If past experience was anything to go by, though, Peter would be so distracted by whatever they were talking about that the toast would be stone cold by the time he got round to it.
'I'm pretty sure they got it all, J- ow!' One of the robots that usually cleaned the place had crept up beside him and pricked his arm with a needle, in a way that Tony felt was unnecessarily hard.
Tony lunged across the table and pressed a finger to his lips. 'Don't get ahead of yourself, Captain. Let's talk about after, after.'
'Five more years? Not too bad then. I just want to give him a solid foundation, you know? I'm not trying to ruin the kid's life. Besides, the tragic widower angle could work after you-'
'Natasha?' Steve said. 'I got them. I'm sorry I took so long, I didn't know which kind to get so I had to-'
Bucky glared at him but dropped into a chair. While Steve had been at his meeting with Howard, Sarah was out meeting with Tony Stark at some coffee shop. She was supposed to have been back by now. Bucky had come to see how it had gone, and when he saw she wasn't there had become even more jittery than Steve.
There was a knock on his door, and his mom poked her head in. 'Steve, I'm heading to work,' she said.
Steve was sitting on the bed, even though he didn't remember sitting down. There, on the dresser, was the black velvet ring box. The reason Steve didn't, couldn't, do any of those things. He was going to marry Tony Stark, and do it right, take it seriously, so that his mom didn't have to live in poverty. He was going to sacrifice everything,
As always, thank you to everyone who commented! The response to the last chapter and the fic as a whole continues to overwhelm me :) I would not have got this far without your encouragement and you inspire me to push on to the end. You guys are the best :')
must have been written about his friend. His friend, his friend, his friend. Tony needed to get over this unrequited crush. Steve deserved someone who could be a friend with no underlying ulterior motives or secret hopes, a friend who didn't fantasise about things he would find extremely uncomfortable.
He opened his eyes. He was lying on the longest couch in his lounge, and on the smaller one, a book in hand, was Steve. He noticed Tony was awake.
,’ Steve snapped. ‘Why not, Romanov? Worried Pete will die? Because let’s just say worrying about that is a little redundant.’
Sometimes Tony had to go to the court, or to a tribunal, and answer question after question about what Venom was, what he had done while it was on him, why he had done it. Mostly, the legal system got on with it without him. His lawyer would bring him the newspapers so he could read the updates.
‘Okay, so you didn’t tell the world. I guess maybe you didn’t want the publicity or something. But to not tell your own kid, that just seems dishonest. And I
The heat of his skin beneath Tony's hands the first time they'd kissed, breathless and desperate, on the side of the river. At the time it had felt like that was the only moment they were ever going to get. It turned out they weren't far wrong, even if, for a few short weeks, they had dared to think differently.
day in the garden,' Steve said, seriously, settling Peter back onto his lap and holding him by his tiny hands. 'The sun was shining, the birds were singing, when suddenly... there was a
'More important things to do, J.' Tony waved the implied admonishment aside. 'How long do I have before he's back? Are they wrapping up?'
They obviously agreed, because Jarvis didn't bother him again but a moment later Frank Sinatra was crooning out
But Tony Stark had never backed down from a challenge. He'd never left a puzzle unsolved. Somehow, he would figure it out.
Steve looked down at the child in his arms and knew there was no point in lying. 'It's a monster. It came out of Mr Stark's flight suit.'
'What the fuck do you think you're doing?' It was the evil ex, of course. Steve had forgotten he was even there. Before Steve could get his treacherous bones arranged to get back on his feet, the guy had hauled him upright. 'You're going after him, right in front of me?'
They rushed the trial because of the press interest, but it still took more than three months to get to the end.
, but it was very difficult to explain the concepts of vigilantism and appropriate force to a three year old, even one as smart as Peter. The faces on the news might as well have been cartoon characters to him. They were criminals, which meant they were Bad Guys, and if Iron Man killed Bad Guys, that meant, quid pro quo (a phrase Peter had actually
‘Yeah?’ Tony half smiled, thought for a moment, and then said decisively, ‘Dandelions. They’re my favourite.’
Peggy was woken by the sudden jolting of the mattress as next to her Steve flung himself upright. It wasn't quite as unusual a happening as she would have liked, but she supposed this was the price they paid for the things they had seen and done during the war.
that Tony didn't know how he was supposed to stop his thoughts from straying. He struggled to get his mind back on the story he'd been telling.
It was a fruitless effort, of course. Nobody loved a party like Tony Stark, even if he was determined to go through it sober. Steve had rarely felt prouder than he did when Tony pinned that blue ribbon to the lapel of his best navy-coloured jacket, the frayed edges a public testament to his determination that meant he'd be judged even more harshly if he made the slightest slip tonight.
, where probing questions will be asked. The aim is generally to establish whether the marriage candidate's personality is compatible with the potential partner's and with the family as a whole.
'I didn't mean just now,' Steve said. He wanted to reach out and touch Barnaby's hand, but he chickened out at the last minute and rubbed the back of his neck instead. It was still burning where Barnaby's hand had been.
When he got in sight of the Sheriff's station he was surprised to see someone waiting out front for him, looking up at the building with interest. Things had been mostly peaceful in Timely since Fisk had gone and they had reached an understanding with Red Wolf's people, and Steve couldn't remember the last time someone had been waiting at the door for him.
Something inside Tony broke then. Only Steve. Only Steve could not only survive being blown up and buried in desert sand, and expect everybody to
But he really didn't want to go to jail. Tony took deep breaths, seriously worried he might puke again.
'Oh.' Howard Stark appraised him again, the edge of a smile tugging at his lips in a way that seemed oddly familiar. 'Well, aren't you a stubborn son of a bitch? That's good. You'll need that if you're going to handle Tony. You want to marry my son, Steve?'
. If you've been googling this, you must have read the newspaper reports from the time. If it was all genuine, then you'd know that Rogers nearly flatlined multiple times during the procedure. The reports say he was in agony, and no wonder, if his body was totally regenerating like they make out. Peter is four years old. Even if we were somehow completely certain we had the formula right, and the procedure right, and that the old stories are completely true, Peter could never survive trauma like that, pain like that. His heart would give out in seconds.'
'Shield is going to help them,' the lady said, and Peter noticed she had a gun on her hip. 'But I need you to go inside with Agent Meason and wait.'
'Don't concern yourself, Sheriff,' Tony said, and Steve latched onto the voice, the world swinging back to rights. Steve felt the lurch and the impact of it, like falling from a horse and hitting the ground. His head ached. 'Your dirty little secret knows to leave out the back.'
Not rising to the bait, Tony went forward and was all charm. Steve thought he recognised the man as a worker in one of the ranches a couple of miles out of town, far enough to try and travel with a near-lame horse. Far enough to carry a story and set tongues wagging, until the story little enough resembled its origin. Steve felt the bile rise in his throat at the thought. Hell's teeth, imagine if he had cradled Tony's face, touched his forehead,
Steve had not been so lucky. His left arm had been trapped in the rock fall along with half of his chest, and his right arm had been twisted enough to dislodge the metal rods Tony had put in. The ribs and arms would heal, according to the surgeon, but in the meantime he was utterly helpless.
'I can't stand music,' Stark said, his teeth gritted, his eyes narrowing. 'I told them no music. I told them.'
A few minutes later they had travelled to the location of the call, and Peter, in his full Spiderman suit, was perched on top of a street lamp waiting for them.
Tony shrugged, couldn't quite meet his eye. 'You never lie to me, Steve. This bozo showed up the day after the fight saying you'd
As she came to move the grocery bag, she noticed the boxes of painkillers lying next to it. Steve must have got them. Natasha suddenly wanted to cry again, but swallowed two of the tablets and put the rest away. Finally, when the place was as tidy as it had ever been, she left the bathroom, dreading that Steve would still be lurking around.
When he'd woken at last, Tony's eyes had been bloodshot enough to be almost completely red, and Steve had been unsure whether it had been tears or booze that had made them that way.
‘H-hi,’ Peter said, and Steve tried to look at him through a strangers’ eyes, saw his tousled hair, his oversized Iron Man t-shirt and
They'd wound up in a late night diner. It was the opposite situation to the bar; here Barnaby was the regular and Steve was the first timer. Barnaby had barely stopped talking, a nervous babbling that Steve found adorable. He waxed lyrical about the pancakes, the waffles, the hot dogs, but especially
He was getting distracted. Tony pulled his mind back to the task at hand, which was disabling Osborn's security system.
'Ah,' Thor said, sounding genuinely disappointed. 'Still, festivities are equally important as justice. And, um, licenses are a kind of justice, if you... if you think about it..' he cleared his throat, clearly no more convinced by this than anyone else.
'Groceries,' Steve said, holding up his plastic shopping bag-for-life in illustration, because of course he was such an old man that he took his own bags to the store. Tony was so dehydrated at this point that he found it endearing.
He took off the helmet and plopped it onto Peter's head, the visor closed. It was far too big and fell right down to rest on Peter's shoulders, but judging from the boy's noises of amazement and wonder there was something spectacular inside it.
'Aww, honey, still? Well, there's some new faces in the house tonight, maybe you'll get lucky. And what about you, sugar?' She turned to Bucky, twirling a dark green band around her long-nailed fingers. 'You're not going to make me give you the band of shame again, are you?'
'You put it on the fridge?' Peter couldn't believe it. Neither, for that matter, could Steve. More than likely, it had been put on just for as long as it took to take the photograph. Still, he appreciated the effort.
'Wait, can we back up here?' Bruce asked, walking over to them with a smile breaking out on his face. 'That was a
Bucky laughed. 'That poor guy doesn't know what he's letting himself in for. Did you manage to find out anything else about him?'
The real problem had been arranging a place to live. The quarters on the Shield base were really only meant for short-term relief, a place to crash for a night or two, and were furnished accordingly. The tiny rooms couldn't really be considered a home, and Steve was already beyond sick of the same four walls and ceiling. He had his military pension and his Shield salary, and he'd intended to find a place to rent. Mary insisted on coming to view apartments with him, and eventually, after the fifth roach-infested tumbledown they'd been to in Brooklyn, had insisted Steve come and live with them. They all said it would only be temporary, until he found somewhere better, but Steve was sure not one of them had actually believed it.
He was so busy thinking about this, barely thinking about the Skrull he was currently grappling with, that he didn't notice it's comrades sneaking up behind him until it was too late. They forced him out of sight, to the far side of a parking garage. Too late he realised they were all covering their mouths with some sort of breathing apparatus from the front of their suits and took a deep breath, but it tasted foul. The world span and he fell to his knees, unable to move, clinging to consciousness.
'Simulation of flying in the suit,' Stark said. 'I was going to take him out for a spin for real but I didn't think his lungs would hold up.'
Steve blinked at him. 'What?' He said, though from the blush creeping up his neck he knew exactly what Tony meant.
Trying to look unconcerned, he stretched himself out long, sprawling over the step and the path below, his feet nearly touching the edge of the perfectly maintained lawn. 'Let me guess, one of your friends is tall, curvaceous and has got legs a mile long?'
He'd sort of expected a big, noisy reaction, but instead everyone seemed to be slightly stunned. Tony knew it wouldn't last, and continued quickly.
It was the sort of call you didn't ignore, no matter what the circumstances. Steve raced back into the room, Stark hot on his heels.
'Well, too bad,' Steve said, putting the bag down on the floor. 'Let's get you dressed, eat some breakfast, and then we'll see what's in the bag, okay?'
'There you are. What are you doing in here?' Steve asked, bending to kiss him on the cheek and spiking him with evergreen leaves in the process. 'I got a wreath,' he said, proudly, holding it up.
come to dinner with me on Saturday.' Steve's feelings obviously showed on his face, because Stark's smirk widened and he continued. 'Oh, don't worry, Princess. I'll be on my best behaviour. You can tell your Pop I'll have you home by curfew.'
‘Alright,’ she said, heading back to the door. ‘Just stay away from Stark, Steve. You’ll wind up getting hurt. If he makes contact again, we want to know about it.’
it could have the whole city in chaos by the end of the day. Never mind the odd plane or building crashing down on them, no-one wanted to re-experience their worst moments. His heart clenched,.
Steve said nothing. He was blinking rapidly now, staring round at the room as if he had never seen it before. Not completely awake, then, whatever terrors had been tormenting him still clinging on. She could feel him starting to shake beneath her hands.
As you might have guessed from the number of updates, I am still suffering writer's block with my original work. Anyone have any tips?! Anyway, thank you again to everyone who read, left kudos or commented- it means the world and you keep me coming back to this :) enjoy!
'I'm sorry, Tony,' he said. 'It was only meant to be a short mission, but when the base blew up and I got separated from Tasha I-'
, of a childhood he admitted he had spent idolising Captain America. He already knew practically every anecdote Steve could tell.
'You fool,' Tony said. 'Steve. Sweetheart. Darling. Listen to me very carefully. I'll marry Angela, and Angela has a friend for you to marry.'
'Go to sleep,' he said, shaking his head. It wasn't exactly the first time their paths had crossed like this.
'Sure,' the man said, looking around nervously. Keeping an eye out for his ex, Steve assumed. 'It's, um, it's... Bar.'
'What, 'beautiful'? Because honestly, look at you. I don't know how I can call you anything else. Or did you mean 'sweetheart'? Or 'blue-eyes'? Because, again-'
The next day, Rhodes showed up, pushed her into a car, and took her to the doctor to get a new prescription of the pill. He told her, quite firmly, that she was getting therapy. Now. Natasha agreed.
So, fast forward from that day at the hospital, and here he and Steve and Bucky all were, in a cabin in the mountains that Tony had inherited. Bucky was doing much better, but the bustle of Christmas in the city had proved to be somewhat overwhelming, and so they had dropped him off here, literally in the middle of nowhere, to spend the holiday period alone. The idea obviously made Steve uncomfortable – it made Tony uncomfortable too, and the condition of Bucky being allowed to use the house was that the therapist signed off on it first – but Bucky had seemed to be looking forward to a peaceful Christmas on his own in the beautiful scenery of the mountains.
'How?' Bucky demanded. 'Steve, we've been like brothers since the day you were born. I know everyone you know; least I thought I did. So, who is he?'
So they lay down together in their bed, and she snuggled close, managing to be big spoon despite being so much smaller than him. It must have been an awkward angle but she ran the fingers of her pinned arm through his hair, soothing and gentle. Steve felt himself beginning to relax.
This addition to the note probably went some way to explain why Tony Stark was currently not in his kitchen, nor anywhere else in Stark Tower. He was, in fact, out in the Iron Man suit, busily breaking into a secure research facility most people had no idea belonged to Norman Osborn.
So he turned his face away from the painting and into his mother's shoulder as if he was seven years old, and he nodded.
'Nice,' he said, and stood up. 'Oh, this is your birthday present, kid.' He tossed the phone back to Peter. 'Enjoy it. It has
And now this. There was shelf after shelf of product, all sorts of brands, different coloured packaging, brazenly displayed. Steve had no idea what a tampon even looked like. Did they come in the squishy plastic packaging? Boxes? Were they bottled?
They had been so excited for Peter's first birthday. They'd planned a party, invited the other families they knew from the hospital, booked a magician – and then, a week before, Peter picked up a cold, which quickly became a chest infection, which wound up as another hospital stay. They hung round at the hospital all day on his birthday, but he only woke up briefly, and was so grumpy he had no interest at all in his gifts.
Things happened very fast after Stark's transformation. He reached out, his arms impossibly long and tentacle-like, and snatched the two nearest Shield agents, lifting them off the floor by the throat. The rest of the agents immediately opened fire, and it was all Steve could do to make sure that his shield was covering both Peter and himself. The monster that had once been Stark merely laughed.
‘I really do,’ Tony sighed, and chose a few more flowers, adding them to the counter. ‘So… a colour blind florist, huh? I’d never have guessed, your bouquets are all stunning.’
With water, his limit was much lower. He had managed five days before he started to feel headachey and dehydrated. Again, he did not know how long he could survive without it.
Steve thought, but just about managed to hold back from saying. They were desperate for money, yet his mother had repeatedly hesitated over this arrangement. Stark didn't care a bit what happened to his son, provided it made them look good. What an asshole. If he really did marry Tony, and Howard came to visit, Steve had a vast selection of laxatives and not-quite-toxic coffee-coloured paints that might accidentally find their way into his father-in-law's drinks.
'Where are we going?' Steve couldn't help asking. The park was almost empty, the grass and bushes frosty with snow, the Christmas lights strung along the footpath not illuminating much beyond it. Snow was starting to fall again, just a light flurry, and Steve's breath was coming in clouds in front of him.
,' Tony complained, burying his face into Steve's chest now that his pillow had gone. 'But don't they know people are trying to sleep?'
Blissfully unaware that anything was wrong, Peter was burbling happily, patting Tony's beard with his tiny hands. The sun was falling against his side, warming him. He hadn't realised how cold he had been. He felt his eyes begin to water.
There was a long silence. Steve only remembered some of the pain he had experienced that day, pain so bad he had blocked most it out. He had thought he was going to die. He had only held on because, well, the chance – however slim – of something better had been preferable to going back, even as his body had changed and grown into something he didn't recognise. The doctor was right; Peter would never survive it, and Steve couldn't put him through it.
'Yeah,' Bucky said, finishing heating the milk and sitting down to give it to Tim. 'Why aren't you?'
It suddenly hit Natasha how stupid she was being, how ridiculous. It wasn't just her and Jarvis any more, she lived in a tower full of Avengers; any of whom could make the journey to the all-night store on the corner. There was a slight chink of light in the darkness.
Steve nodded again. It was not the first time they'd had a conversation like this, and he always had the same question.
'Well, we wouldn't want anything crazy to happen,' Steve said. He could feel the conversation wrapping up, ending before it had begun, and he desperately didn't want that. 'So, um, can I get your name? In case you go missing and I need to tell the police they should check under random people's tables.'
And once she had said that, it was easier to say other things too, especially as Steve worked most of it out for himself.
'Looking good,' Steve had said, because of course he had, because about things like that, at least, he was
Suddenly, the face plate snapped open and Peter jumped back into his pillows. Steve was practically between them before he knew what he was doing. Stark smirked at him.
Steve groaned, burying his face in his hands. It wasn't too late to back out, of course. But if he did, what he was going to do about the medical bills? They'd have to declare bankruptcy.
'Okay, so what are we looking at here?' Tony asked, squeezing Peter's shoulder in apology. 'Some sort of time loop?'
'Oh, Steve,' she said, reaching out for his hand; but he moved his away before she could take it. 'I'm sure it wasn't your fault. And you mustn't lose hope, not if... is this person still alive?'
She smiled. It made him melt. He, this Steve, would marry her all over again for that smile. 'Okay then,' she said. 'Lay down.'
Tony couldn't comment on that. To him, it was obvious that his dad would have been at anything that promised to be a good party. Plus, given the boasts in the programme about how every dime, nickel and penny would go to the war effort, the publicity probably hadn't hurt. The gala had taken place at the height of Captain America's popularity, just before the USO tour had headed over to Europe. It was no wonder, really, they had asked him to perform a song of his own.
First to go, it is alleged, is Miss Pepper Potts, personal assistant to Mr Stark, who was instrumental in sustaining the company during Mr Stark's absence. Although she was not included in the original list of higher level executives included in the blanket firing, witnesses report that she was seen arguing with Mr Stark after the conference and was told to clear out her office.
He was in his suit. It was a cheap, itchy polyester thing that always felt too hot, that he'd only ever worn for funerals. The jacket had gone to holes in the armpit and he'd had to hurriedly try and sew it back together; and the cut of it had been out of fashion when his mom had bought it for him almost seven years before. The tie had been his father's. The shirt and shoes were Bucky's, and no amount of folding and tucking or padding with socks could disguise the fact they were far too big for him. The ridiculous engagement ring on his finger was making his whole hand ache, and he was desperate to take it off, but couldn't. He was sitting in his uncomfortable suit on a small couch that had probably cost more than their apartment, just outside the heavy oak door to Howard Stark's personal office. Opposite him, a few steps away over a marble floor, Stark's PA kept glaring stonily at him.
He had never been so glad to see the blue of the summer sky, the green of the grass, that meant this was Earth. More than that, it was a place he knew; a park not far from the site of their original HQ. The ship must have advanced cloaking devices to hide somewhere so central.
‘Aww, gorgeous, don’t be that way,’ Stark said, his tone switching from cold disinterest to wheedling amusement. ‘It was all for you.’
'Aren't you supposed to be professional, Mr Shield Liaison Officer?' Tony asked, watching Steve pace back and forth. 'Steve. Come on, it's a fair verdict.'
'Hey there,' he smirked, strolling over. Steve gripped the handles of the pushchair tighter, and turned Peter to face away from them.
moving, he could feel it straining – but Mr Osborn came up behind him and pulled him away, lifting him off his feet. For a moment Peter wasn't sure what was happening, the whole world turned around him, and then Mr Osborn dropped him hard onto the table, pinning him down, and pressing a mask over his face. It was like the one Peter used to have to give him oxygen, but Peter knew it wasn't oxygen this time, and alarms were going off in his head and his stomach and all down his arms, and he kicked and kicked, but Mr Osborn was on top of him now, using his whole body to pin him down, and so Peter held his breath, and he could hold his breath for ages now, but then Mr Osborn elbowed him in the stomach and he breathed in and he knew that was it. His eyes felt heavy. He didn't want to sleep, but he couldn't help it.
The rest of his body was freezing, but Steve's throat and his chest were burning, as if all the heat from his body had been sucked to just those two places. It made it painful to breathe. The air felt like lead weight in his lungs.
'Oh, no, she's not...' Steve trailed off, realising it didn't really matter. 'Do you, uh, do you understand any of this?'
'Don't you dare laugh at him!' He roared. 'Of course he doesn't have a future as an artist! He doesn't have
'You are intruding in the vents,' was all Jarvis said, once more. Peter ducked in and started to scramble through. It was dark in there, but he could see a strange light ahead, gold and blue in turn. He went towards it.
'No,' Steve said, simply. For a long moment, there was silence, in which Tony fought the urge to vomit, or to cry. Then Steve added, 'It's nice to meet you, Tony.'
But there was no laws against topping and tailing in a bed as wide as Tony's. Even if sometimes, in the dark, Tony would run his toes up Steve's calves and make him shiver. There were no laws against that, either. Still, people were talking more than usual. It made him nervous, but he comforted himself with the thought that he was the only lawman in town. If Timely wanted him arrested, they'd have to get someone else in to do it and they'd surely catch wind and have time to run before that could happen.
'You scared me, popping out like that, Mr Stark,' he said cheerily. 'But then it looks like I scared you too. Work all finished, is it? Right you are, let me just put this away and I'll get out of your hair.'
I'm going to take a bit of time off from fanfiction for now, to try and actually get my original novel done. But I have no doubt I'll be back sooner or later!
'Peter, I rescued you.' Mr Osborn leaned forward in his chair. 'Listen, I have a son about your age. Harry. I love him so much. But sometimes, he doesn't think I know what's best, and we fight. And when that happens, it doesn't look like I love him, but I do.'
Except Steve wasn't leaving. He'd sat back down, but still looked awkward, leaning forward on his elbows and staring at his feet.
‘Because maybe colours aren’t as important as shape and structure,’ Steve said. ‘Or, you know. I can
Some countries were starting to allow binding again for the purposes of therapy and in the treatment of trauma, and before he got sick Steve might have agreed, but now... it was like part of him was missing. The months before his illness were all but gone; just hazy, half-remembered things that glinted in the corners of his mind but vanished when he turned to look at them. His friends had told him about things he had done, shown him the pictures, and they were familiar, but not
'Ah,' Steve had said, at the pile of snow that had built up two thirds of the way up the door frame. That was all he had said. They were stuck.
He smoothed down the flight suit and began working his way into the armour. This was going to be fun.
look Tony was giving him and caught his meaning. He flushed, all his blood rushing to his face – and somewhere else. Dammit.
Instinctually, Tony drew back. 'My flight suit,' he said, guardedly. He didn't want Steve to ask him questions about that. He didn't like it when people asked him about that.
'No, it's just...' Natasha said, giggling again as she thought of it. 'It feels like we're in the field. Hawkeye, get up top. Widow, see if you can find another way out. Iron Woman, stop crying...'
‘The good folks at the museum seem to disagree,’ Stark examined the leaflet again, ‘As do 2 million visitors a year, apparently.’
Panic, which had been barely held back, burst through the dam and overwhelmed her, drowned her. She couldn't do this. She couldn't do this. She couldn't do this.
Bucky arrived then, still in his grease-stained jeans and shirt from his job. ‘We really must stop meeting like this, Steve,’ he deadpanned, and settled into the seat beside Steve’s mom. ‘Especially when you missed movie night.’ Steve had been out for almost twenty four hours.
'I'm not here to hurt anyone,' he said. 'I'm here to stop my mom from ending up homeless because of my medical debt.'
Maybe this guy was a weirdo after all. Or he was just as nervous as Steve was. Either way, Barnaby quickly moved the conversation on.
Steve no longer looked angry, but there was still a troubled crease of worry between his eyebrows. It was sort of cute. Tony resisted the surprisingly tender urge to kiss it smooth. Despite what Steve had said about sex being off the cards, Tony felt it was definitely still on the table. Possibly
Over the next week, Steve kept bumping into Richard as life on the base flowed around him. They'd meet in the cafeteria queue or end up in the library or gym at the same time. Richard introduced Steve to his wife, Mary, who was just as amicable as him. They, unlike the rest of Shield, didn't seem to be in awe of Captain America. There was no wall between them. The second appointment was slightly longer.
you!' Peter was kneeling up on the mattress now, keen for a better look. 'I knew it! I knew Iron Man was Tony Stark!' In his excitement, he was bobbing up and down on the bed springs.
He wasn't sleeping. Was avoiding the news. He'd given strict instructions that all flowers and letters of condolence should be redirected, donated, stored. He didn't want to see them, or think about them. Denial was his only hope of functioning. He needed to pretend that Steve was still just away on a mission, or the weight of it would crush him.
'Well, I hate to tell you this, but you've got the wrong Avenger. I'm the one with the big A on my head, you want the one with the nightlight in his chest.'
Steve nodded, then shook his head. 'No, wait. If I'm taking that much money off him, the least I can do is look him in the eye and thank him myself.'
Steve smacked at it with the shield, but it didn't seem to make any difference, the thing only laughed, squeezed tighter.
Well, not him, not any more, never again. Tony glanced around the place just to double check. The only movement was one of his robots, precisely programmed for only the tasks he wanted it to do, quietly collecting his discarded clothes. Good. It was as it should be. Ever since Tony had escaped, he had cultivated a life where he was completely in control of every aspect. That had been part of the reason the company had had to go. There had been too many people, too many variables, too many strings to keep hold of even for him. It wasn't like he had needed the money anyway. Now his brain, his inventions, were only for him. When he wanted something, he got it. When he didn't like something, he got rid of it. He had simplified his life, stripped it to the bare elements, made it streamlined and efficient, and nothing happened to
, a sleek black car arrived to pick them up and they were taken to the most ridiculously ornate house that Steve had ever been to, far too big for one bitter old man to rattle around alone in, but he didn't care. It didn't matter how thick the carpets were or how comfortable the couch was to sit on, or how Howard was glaring at them as his mom tried to make small talk, as if the whole thing had been their fault. He just wanted to see Tony.
It was only by the grace of God, really, that none of these things had happened before. Tony hadn't exactly been the best father. Peter was a result of a one night stand, and for the first four years of his life Tony had been content to take a back seat to the mom and step dad, sending money and gifts when he managed to remember Peter existed. His visits had been rare and brief. It was only after Mary and Richard had died so suddenly, and Peter had gone to live with his aunt and uncle, that he had started trying to be involved more regularly; but even then he could have done a hell of a lot more. Maybe if he had, Peter wouldn't have lost everything again when his aunt and uncle died when Peter was only eight. It was only then, when Peter finally came to live with him, that Tony had realised the little boy was the best thing that could ever happen to him. It just sucked that it had taken a tragedy to make him see it.
Tony drummed his fingers on the table, now sticky with coffee residue, and was suddenly struck with inspiration. 'Jarvis,' he said, 'Search the Starkhive.'
. Especially not an orange that had stuff sticking out of it on cocktail sticks with a candle in the top. It looked like the 1950s idea of a space ship. Tony wrinkled his nose at it, picking it up and waving it to the room at large. 'Look, I'm trying to keep this place classy,' he said. 'You guys mind leaving your weird ass snacks somewhere else?'
Natasha took a deep breath. This team really needed more gender representation. But Clint was married, right? He was probably used to buying tampons. He probably did it all the time. 'Clint?'
'You look great,' Steve said, earnestly, brushing a little dust off Tony's shoulder, just as an excuse to touch him.
The restraints snapped, and Steve rolled off the table, out of the heaving mass of the window to the multiverse. There was no time to catch his breath, he was alone and surrounded by Skrulls. Undaunted, he set to work taking them out. He didn't have time for this. He had more important things to do, like finding Tony, his Tony, and kissing him senseless.
Peter was crying in earnest now, which meant he had enough breath to do it. Steve went back to the lounge so he wouldn’t have to see it. He had never made Peter cry before.
Tony had to admit he didn't really get it. They'd gone to an art show way back in February, to a tiny gallery in the middle of nowhere, because Steve had seen some artist on pinterest that was going to be displaying. Tony hadn't been in the best of moods as they'd fought their way through the snow and slush to get there, but all that had changed as soon as they'd gotten inside. Steve had looked around at the paintings and sculptures, his face lit up with delight and awe. The only other thing Tony had seen him pull that face for was, well, him. So he'd gone back later and spoken to artist, asked for a commission. For months they had been trading emails, sketches, designs, and now the finished product was in Tony's hands; a vase, but not the sort you'd actually put flowers in. It had a shape that looked like water flowing, caught in a moment between moments. The colour changed depending on what angle the light caught it at, but all of its shades were peaceful, like hope, like yearning. It was beautiful, and Steve would love it. It was also the perfect size to fit into the empty cupboard.
'Maybe not,' Steve said, tearing his eyes away from where Peter was now bending and swaying on the bed. 'Stark. Thanks for this.'
'Don't worry, Cap,' Tony said, managing a smile that was almost convincing. 'It's the right thing to do.'
Steve reassembled the phone, forcing himself to calm down. He didn’t notice the tracker embedded beneath the battery, still sitting there and still operational.
in the margins. Neither of them corrected him. 'Of course, if you really want to sell yourself then.... Sorry, Mrs Rogers, close your eyes.' He wrote one more thing at the end of the list. Steve read it and immediately felt himself going bright red.
The first date had been more or less out of pity. Steve had just come out to the team as bi a few days before, and had said he had been bad enough at dating women, so would have no idea how to date men. Tony had told him that for a start off he needed to stop thinking of it as 'dating men' or 'dating women' and try treating them as individuals, and so Steve had asked if he would go to dinner with him and 'show him how it was done'. The smooth bastard.
'You've fit between my legs plenty of times before,' Steve commented mildly. Scandalised, Tony swooped down and swept Peter up into his arms protectively.
all Bucky's, only a few had his chin or Clara's eyes, but what was he meant to do? Leave a kid out on the street after their Pa didn't come home from the war and their had Ma passed; or let them go into care somewhere in a neighbourhood where nobody knew them? Or let them starve for food or love in a house somewhere where they weren't wanted? Not on his watch. The Barnes would take in anyone who needed to be taken in, end of discussion. Even if the neighbours complained of the noise, and made nasty comments about him and his wife just because she was the one going out getting a wage, or worse, made veiled remarks about the kids, just because they had the black ones and the white ones living together as family. Shock! Horror! Scandal! Ugh. Bucky had bigger things to worry about, especially at this time of day. He'd managed to get them all out into the front yard, nearly to the gate, but Katherine's braids just wouldn't go
His fingers and toes were starting to hurt from clinging on for so long. And it was windy, being up so high, so he was frozen. The glass wall, too, seemed to be made from sheer ice. Peter reached, lost his grip, and scrambled to try and get it back.
Steve had never liked the idea of a soulmate. He hadn't liked the idea of fate or the universe or whoever forcing him to love someone. But it didn't feel like that any more. He could have fallen on his knees and thanked the powers that they had found each other. He could have run out into the night, asthma be dammed, joints be dammed, and straight back to Barnaby. He could have called him right there and then, despite the time, and told him everything.
She ignored his blathering, pulling herself up, hurriedly fastening her pants and running to the door. She opened it a crack, snatched the bag, slammed the door shut again, and emptied the bag onto the floor, scrabbling for a tampon so she could finally, finally sort herself out.
Steve nodded self-consciously, fingers instinctively going to the back of his neck, just about able to feel the bumps and whorls of the blemish there. It was still grey and cold, and now, it would stay that way the rest of his life.
Except now Thor was unusually quiet, looking back and forth between them, suspicion clouding his features. Tony left Steve's side to slap Thor on the back congenially. He'd built up quite a friendship with the Deputy, having been disposed to like him from the beginning because of the workload and risk he'd taken off Steve. Oftentimes if Steve was late back for lunch he'd find the two of them laughing and conversing easily together.
He'd heard her laugh. 'Sorry,' he said, moving to let go, but relenting when she clung on. It was pathetic, but hey, she'd already embarrassed herself this much, she might as well make the most of it.
and asked for a strawberry base, with peach pearls. It was his favourite. The other barista (?) turned around and started work. Tony practically salivated all over the laminated wood of the counter.
Even that first time, the idea had been soul-destroying, heart-shattering. Steve had been determined it wouldn't happen again, except that Stark kept getting drunk, and then he would practically throw himself at Steve; and Steve would always wait until he sobered up, thinking he would change his mind, but Stark never did. And so they ended up in bed together, over and over again, night after night, and the shame and the sadness ate away at him, and he promised himself he would stop, but it was always Tony that initiated it, and Steve couldn't say no – he loved him. Pathetic as it was, he loved this man who didn't love him, and he would do anything to be near him. Even if he knew he was abusing his position, his power, even if everything about it was
(‘Tony was abroad with his parents,’ Bucky would say. ‘The two of them tragically separated before they could even admit how horny they were for each other.’)
'I'm fine, Tony.' Steve let his arms drop. He'd forgotten they were fighting. 'How long was I gone?'
Steve just shook his head, unable to stop smiling. He would tell his mom the full story, but Tony deserved to know first.
Those nights when Steve had been forced to throw him in a cell, they talked and talked, and oftentimes it didn't even make any sense, but it was enough to intrigue him. Something about Tony had drawn him in, convinced him that there was more to the soak than everyone thought. Gradually, they began to talk the morning after too. Then Steve got to know his habits a bit better and started being able to track him down before he got drunk enough to turn criminal. He'd drag Tony out of whatever saloon he'd found him in, walk him home or back to Steve's little room, and they'd play chess or checkers until Tony either sobered up or fell asleep at the table.
'Pete didn't tell you?' Tony went to him, took his hand, trying to be reassuring. 'Honey, I'm sorry. Yeah, it's online. It's kind of everywhere. But it's going to be okay, we'll handle it.'
Thor thought this was a rather pretty blessing, one he had written a few years ago in the index at the back of the ledger and had been saving for a special occasion, but it might have been a little bit too effective; the happy couple just looked at him and each other with something like confusion.
. How did people do this every day? He just wanted bubble tea, for goodness' sake. How many hours over the course of a lifetime did normal people spend just
Barnaby beamed at him. 'My best friend's name is James too. I knew I trusted you! You can't go wrong with a James.' He pointed at the glass near Steve's elbow. 'You still going on that or can I buy my hero a drink?'
The meeting had gone okay, she'd thought. It had been brief, only twenty minutes or so. Stark had had notes. He had asked a little more about Steve's and their family's medical history, had tersely explained terms – Steve would be expected to be the model trophy husband, basically, faithful and obedient to the family, and in return his debts would be paid, he would be fully provided for and his mother would receive a generous monthly allowance – and then had seemed to consider the conversation closed. He hadn't been at all interested in who Steve was as a person beyond Sarah's (not entirely truthful) assurance that he could 'toe the line'. When Sarah had asked what his son, Tony, was like, Stark had dismissed the question with 'He's fine, he'll do as he's asked'. He had not asked about blemishes, presumably not thinking it was important. Sarah had not liked Howard Stark one bit.
Filthy as they were, he decided to keep his hands out of his pockets, where they could be clearly seen. And then he realised that, as no-one knew who he was, if he wanted bubble tea, he would have to wait in line with everyone else. Tony surveyed it in horror. The line was at least seven people long; how long would that take to clear? He'd never had to wait in line in his life.
ran a yearly special on it. He always had a theme and went all out to turn his home into a festive retreat; sometimes classy, sometimes gaudy, elegant, tacky, retro, modern, real, synthetic, he had done it all. One thing he did not do, however, was
'Definitely,' Steve's saviour nodded, showing him the large bar of Hershey's he was carrying. 'If you're sent out for tampons, always get chocolate too. Only way we can help.' With that, he picked up a box of tampons and strolled off towards the counter.
'I fly, you hold on,' Stark said, coming up behind him and without further ado wrapping his arms around Steve's waist. 'Damn,' he said, 'Did the serum grow everything but your hips? How do you not snap in two? You're shaped like an equilateral triangle, like, 45 degrees all over, I'm serious. The uniform suits you, by the way. Welcome back.'
Tony's eyebrows shot up. He resisted the urge to wolf whistle. He couldn't imagine Steve being caught in a cupboard with anyone.
After that, the men had come and taken over the caves, with their electric lights almost as bad as the sun, and their radios and noise and their guns and weapons and Venom had been driven back, in here, to this little patch of dark and quiet. Sometimes they pushed people in here, men and women and children too, and they had all died. None of them were strong enough.
'Yeah, okay,' Tony said. 'The thing is, none of us are really religious. Well, most of us aren't. Then Wanda is Jewish and Bruce has the whole Buddhist thing and Thor actually is a god so...'
‘Okay, well, uh…’ Steve scanned the shop. The bouquet would have to have peonies and carnations, he knew, to mean
'Ga,' Peter agreed. He wasn't paying much attention to the adults, more interested in the light of the arc reactor, running his hands over it with clumsy fingers. Peter loved the arc reactor, which meant that Tony loved it too.
No-one would soon forget the tragedy of the night the Maximoff house had burnt down. Steve and Tony had both been there along with everyone else; Steve arranging the townsfolk to make supply lines for the buckets, Tony turning up with a high power hose he'd managed to rig together for the purpose, but it had been too late. Steve and Bucky had got the kids out, but hadn't been able to get to the parents in time. Wanda Maximoff and her twin brother Pietro had been just ten at the time, and the town had come together to give them lessons and errands to earn their keep, to keep them from stealing or prostitution. Last summer they'd turned fourteen, Pietro had been apprenticed at the apothecary's, and to Steve's utter contempt, some of the men had started to pay Miss Maximoff completely inappropriate attentions. The same men who would have been happy to find her in a brothel would accept carrying her off as a reluctant bride. It didn't bear thinking about. She was still a child.
'Alright then, baby doll,' Steve murmured, and to his credit he only blushed a little. 'I'll keep reminding you you're gorgeous.'
This wasn't healthy, Tony knew, but if he let himself fall into that precipice again he'd never get out of the yawning void of it, and Peter needed him.
He found Steve standing at the sink, washing up a chopping board. Tony shoved the orange under his nose.
The second Tony slammed into his house, he ripped his shirt and trousers back off, stripping down to the flight suit, waving his free hand to open a computer interface.
'I'm not saying I was ready to give it to you,' Steve said. 'But I saw it last time we were in Dehli. I thought it would be perfect for you, so I bought it. Just in case.'
. She wasn't going to go through this again. Not this month. This was the month she was going to handle everything fine, finally get her act together enough to go back to the doctors and get a new supply of contraceptive pill - or better yet, a hysterectomy. She would go. She would talk to her doctor. She just needed a tampon first, and then she was good to go. There was a box in the bathroom cupboard left over from last time, she had regularly opened the door over the last few weeks just to make sure it was still there and it was.
'I know, I shouldn't, I wish I hadn't, but it was just this one girl... she was on the cover of the magazine. She was really pretty.'
. When he was a kid and burning up with fever, he used to touch his fingers to it, believing it would somehow cool the rest of him down. The only reason it would be warm would be -
Except, of course, he didn't. Steve had been staying in Tony's house the best part of a year now, and he still had managed to not cross that line. Just about. If he did, and they were caught, Tony would be strung up for sodomy and maybe, if the preacher was to be believed, sent to eternal damnation. Steve privately thought that the God he knew had mercy on temptation, that it was hard to see the sin and darkness in a feeling that made him feel like he was being flooded with light from the inside out; but what did he know? He couldn't risk it. Besides, he knew the law of men right enough, and he knew how easy it would be to get caught. So no, he did not kiss Tony's hair that day, just like he didn't kiss it any other time. He was careful that there was never anything improper between them, besides the feelings he kept locked in his breast. Tony said their relationship was
He had explained it all to Peter. How Mr Stark had made some new medicine for him, and it seemed to have made his lungs and heart stronger and work properly, but because nobody else had ever had the medicine before they needed to make sure it hadn't done anything it wasn't supposed to. Peter asked where Mr Stark had gone, and his dad had given one of the non-answers adults gave when they thought things were too hard for kids to understand, and had changed the subject. Peter just hoped Mr Stark was okay. He had saved Peter's life. And his dad used to say Iron Man wasn't a hero.
'I'm just gonna have to make sure you never want to leave me, soldier.' They had reached the warehouse now. Tony knew it was the right warehouse because there was a daisy that had pushed its way through a gap in the slabs outside, and it was growing and dying and rotting and then growing and dying and rotting over again. That was new. For a moment they stood and watched it.
'Sorry,' the stranger said. 'I've never been here before and I know he hasn't either. I thought he'd been following me and we were about to end up in crazy town.'
Steve frowned at the nickname, the stab of jealousy having the complete opposite effect than he assumed Tony had been going for. 'I'm not ready for my bath chair just yet, thank you.'
'The glass will now be electrified,' Jarvis announced, and Peter yelped in fright, but there was no accompanying shock. All that happened was that the glass around him heated up slightly.
Steve didn't want to lie, so he didn't answer. 'Can I have some time to think? About whether to... take him home?'
Steve had had some rough mornings before. His mother had died just after dawn one day. He’d woken up stiff as a board and soaked after sleeping in the mud for a mission. He’d spent mornings captured by the enemy, and mornings fighting, being shot at, running risks. He remembered distinctly watching the sun come up the first morning after he lost Bucky, and realising that this was the first day where Bucky wasn’t alive, and that he wouldn’t be every day for the rest of time.
He'd only heard of tampons since coming to the future and seeing adverts on the television, which all seemed to feature young, attractive women at parties or on beaches with young, attractive men, other girls, and slogans about empowerment and doing what you needed to do. Steve had assumed that it was about sex. Everything in the future seemed to be about sex and getting as much of it as possible as quickly as possible, and he'd somehow wound up assuming these 'tampons' were some sort of condom for girls. Possibly because, he realised now, the words were sort-of similar.
His colour was back now. More than back, Steve was flushing redder than the knickers. Tony started to think he was missing something. He held on. Steve pulled on the underwear, stretching them out between them, the delicate lace straining.
'Do we have an issue here?' Steve asked, pulling himself up to his full height. He had no patience for people who were pointlessly antagonistic.
Steve wondered whether Stark had called in advance to arrange all this, or whether they just kept the table and wine available for him at all times, like the Phantom of the Opera and his box at the theatre. Steve decided to keep that particular comparison to himself, certain that Stark would be a little too pleased about it.
The malicious playfulness seemed to be over with. Venom was smaller now, and no longer wreaking havoc for the sake of it. The goal now seemed to be getting to Stark Tower as quickly as possible, and Steve followed, weighing up his next steps. Venom must have a reason for wanting to go there, and probably had some sort of plan or trap in place. Perhaps, then, he should try to trigger the fight early – but at least in the tower it would be contained, restricted to just the two of them. Even if it was a trap, there was no question that he ought to accept the bigger risk himself in order to reduce it for civilians. So Steve hung back, let Venom make his way forward, trying to keep everyone else safe. They'd have this fight at the tower.
. She pressed the cushion tighter onto her stomach, willing the pressure to confuse her bladder into thinking it was empty. Her stomach cramped in protest, her insides shifting.
'Your offspring will be healthy and numerous,' Thor explained, then remembered too late that Midgard also had hang ups about who could and should raise children. 'If that is what you want,' he added, a little belatedly. He hoped they did want. He had worked hard finding appropriate blessings. He took a sip of his drink to hide his disappointment.
'Tony,' Steve said, not sure how he was going to finish the sentence, but Tony cut him off with one of his brilliant smiles that didn't quite get to his eyes.
For a second Stark looked startled, then he obeyed, undoing the straps and lying Peter down on the ground as Steve got the tank out, opened the valves, pressed the mask to Peter's face.
The people were no different. He had eliminated them from his professional and home life; now he only had people around when he wanted company. That was easy enough too. Everyone had strings that could be pulled to make them act as he wanted them to. Most of them made it pretty easy, if they knew what he wanted of them. Even Captain Rogers, who was not the usual hot-body-empty-head type Tony usually targeted, had made it pretty obvious where to pull. He just wanted to make his little boy happy. Tony wanted the Captain. It wasn't hard to make it happen.
'Wait,' he tried to say, but nothing came out. His lips had dried shut, and he didn't have the strength to part them. He wanted to open his eyes, but they wouldn't listen.
'To be fair, Cap,' he replied, setting the cup down, 'It hardly counts as a side effect when he's fine. Better than fine. We both saw him, he's absolutely delighted.'
Introduction – A meeting then takes place between the parents of the marriage candidates. The marriage candidates themselves are not present. This meeting acts as a kind of interview, where general factors such as finances, education, health, and whether either party has a
'Iron Man,' Steve said, pointing back at the bird. Reluctantly he turned back and saw the same bird flying across the street – from the same point it had started from before. As he watched, he saw what Peter had meant. The bird, some sort of seagull, was flying no more than a few yards before it would suddenly reach a certain point in the sky and disappear, only to reappear back where it had begun and repeat the process. Over and over again.
‘No, no, you were right. Pink roses for beauty. Red is for love, obviously, and white is for, um... purity?'
'Yep, Ty's one of a kind,' a voice replied wryly, and Steve sat bolt upright. It wasn't Bucky out here helping him, it was Barnaby. And Steve had just explosively emptied his guts in front of him. 'Here,' Barnaby said, offering him a bottle of water. Steve took it automatically, washing his hands and face with a little of it before rinsing his mouth out with the rest. At least his nose had already stopped bleeding.
'What the crap have you done now, Rogers?' He demanded. 'You know when people say their best friend would help them hide a body they're usually being metaphorical.'
The commotion had woken up Peter, who was looking around in confusion, straining to see over the shield even as Steve tried to keep him behind it. The agents opened fire on the creature again as Steve tried to be heard over the noise.
'Yeah,' Tony replied. 'It was one of the bigger stories that year. Destroyed the last few hold-outs who still wore briefs.'
Tony tried to speak, but all that came out was a super weird rasping sound. The probably-barista looked downright alarmed. Hastily, Tony cleared his throat –
Mr Stark did not explain the circumstances of his escape and refused to comment on rumours that he utilised a weaponised suit of body armour. Instead, in a move that surprised everyone, he explained openly how he had seen Stark Industries products in what he described as 'the wrong hands'. He announced that he was therefore firing all of his senior management officials and stopping all further production, effective immediately, whilst he begins the process of dissolving the company entirely. You can read the full statement
Tony had had plenty to keep him occupied, however. Just having a small child in the building seemed to take up a great deal of his time. Within six hours of Peter's arrival, where the kid had been following him around like a duckling, he'd realised that Peter's curious little eyes and hands were going to want to be in the lab, and the choice was to either ban him completely (aka the
'Nope,' Steve frowned. 'I've just been getting groceries on the way here. That bag is full of broccoli and sprouts.'
On the next table, a young man looked absolutely mortified, throwing his phone down. Clearly he had been trying to take a picture of them on the sly and forgotten about the flash. Tony, however, seemed unperturbed. He simply carried on drinking his wine, crooking the finger of one hand at the waiter.
'Then show me,' she said, not sure how to respond to the second half of his sentence. He obliged, lifting her onto the counter and proceeding to demonstrate his love in a
So Steve wasn't exactly pleased about the fact Tony had been going through his trash. He seemed much more concerned about that than he did about the incriminating list, in fact, which did not reassure Tony at all about his priorities.
got home, but for the time being, he needed to use this undisturbed time to sneak Steve's present in.
was proud of him. A small, warm feeling spread inside him. The situation suddenly didn't seem so bad.
assignments like this. Helpless, he looked back at the question again, hoping it would make more sense.
It had hurt. Peter didn't like to think about that part. Mr Stark had injected him with fire, and it hurt, and went all round his body and kept burning, even though his dad had been there stroking his hair and saying it was okay, and it had
'You okay?' She asked, suddenly worried that this was too much. After all, they hadn't talked about any of this in concrete terms. Maybe it was too much -
The next day, Steve wanted to go back to the shop, even though he knew Tony wouldn’t be there. His mom said no and headed to work.
'No!' Peter said, sounding stricken, and started climbing up the wall, clearly intent on following until Steve grabbed him around the waist and pulled him down.
At first it talked about 'scientific consultancy', dealing with transports, computer systems, tracking devices, threat detection, communications, and all other non-weapon aspects of a shady intelligence organisation. But then he turned the page and saw a single paragraph that, he suspected, was the real reason they had set this up.
Barnaby looked at the sky, then at the ground, then finally at Steve as he shrugged. 'I get it,' he said. 'Honestly, I'm not... exactly...
Peter closed his eyes. Nothing happened. He peeped out between his lids, and, not sure what was happening, carried on scrambling up.
going to barf over Barnaby. He dashed for the front door as quick as he could manage, collapsing onto the kerb and emptying his stomach into the gutter. As usual, the smell of his own vomit made him retch, and for a while it was all he could do to try and vomit and breath at the same time. A warm, firm hand appeared on the back of his neck, helping keep him in position. Bucky. How many times had they done this? Damn, he was pathetic. Barnaby would probably sneak out the back while he had the chance.
'Stark!' Thor's cheery voice came, and Steve turned to see the deputy approaching. Like Tony, Thor had dressed for the occasion, looking rather dashing in a deep red coat that reached almost to his knees, his long hair pulled back. On his arm was a tall, striking woman with masses of flowing red hair and an imposing expression. She didn't smile as they came near.
to, who else did? Who had he told? Did it even need to be told or was it obvious? They'd been so careful. Tony squeezed his arm comfortingly, looking characteristically unconcerned. His expression calmed Steve a little.
'Yes, well, inhaler, insulin and bed I think. I'll get this sent over as soon as it's properly dry. What's it called?'
'Thanks, Meredith,' he said, and it came out quiet and shaky, as if his voice had gone somewhere far away behind the sudden lump in his throat. She cocked an eyebrow at him.
Peter looked genuinely startled and sat bolt upright, watching as Iron Man landed outside and strode towards the fire escape that would let him into Peter's room. Peter cast around wildly, as though lost, then turned to Steve.
'You gotta be reasonable, Sheriff,' he'd said. 'I'm already gonna be walking with a limp, here. A man can only take so much. It was only a little drunken misdemeanour.'
'But we didn't have dessert,' Stark said, almost pouting. 'You owe me dessert. So when I saw you heading to the park, I thought, hey, let's get ice cream.' He tried to lean around Steve, to see the pushchair behind him. 'You want ice cream, right, Pete?'
'Sir, it seems the music is still audible in the common room,' Jarvis said, snapping Tony's focus again. He sighed. They didn't understand that when your mind steamed ahead as quick as his did, he needed the music to drown half his thoughts out so he could concentrate on a single thing at once. And he wanted to get this done today.
Steve shook his head. 'His dad is obviously keen to keep him out of the public eye. There's a couple of references if you search online, but when you try to follow the link or find a picture the page has always been taken down. Makes you wonder what he's trying to hide.'
Still, this lady looked fierce like a lion, and she had already walked quickly away towards the other three agents that were the only ones still standing up, and a man had taken Peter's hand and led him back inside. In his other hand he held his own gun, up and ready.
Steve shrugged him off, but stood, looking regretfully at his dessert. He had lost his appetite since Stark had started implying there would be more
‘You must realise how it looks,’ Romanov said, examining one of Peter’s drawings taped to the fridge. Steve resisted the temptation to take it down, put it somewhere she couldn’t see it. ‘You have a cosy little romantic dinner with a known vigilante and mercenary, one of the best, one that we haven’t managed to stop, and the next day you tell us you’re not ‘available’ to work with us any more, stop taking our calls… Fury is worried, Captain.’
'How much sleep did you two actually get?' T'Challa asked. 'I don't want you falling asleep in the field.'
And Steve opened his mouth to say that he didn’t know, he really did. He was going to say that he didn’t know the meanings of flowers, only how to put them together artistically. He was going to advise Tony to just get something beautiful, in the recipient’s favourite colours, and write an apology in the card. But instead he found himself saying, ‘Sure, we can do that.’
Then there were the little gifts, the small luxuries Steve would enjoy but wouldn't buy for himself; fluffy socks and bubble bath, the truffles he could eat by the truckload. Those weren't particularly secret. But Steve's main present, his
Tony looked around the cell. As it was used for those awaiting trial, not those already convicted, it wasn't as bad as it could have been. He had a bed, a chair, even a desk. And absolutely no tech, and nothing to do but think.
'Yeah,' Bucky said, 'Because if you lose your temper and tell him his money is dirty and washed in the blood of the proletariat we're going to be back to square one.'
, and neither of them had managed a solo nappy change yet. They couldn't figure out how you were meant to hold the baby and deal with the diaper with only two hands. Besides, Steve was meant to be on leave for months yet. So Tony had grumbled, but he hadn't really fought. They both knew he didn't want to leave them. They both knew he had to. So Steve grabbed his kit bag and left with Natasha, and Tony watched Clint swing Peter around and make him laugh, and tried not to feel like anything was missing.
It was completely dark inside. There wasn't so much as a millimetre of space between the door and the dirt floor of the cave. He couldn't even make out an outline of the door. Only the diminished glow of the fading arc reactor gave the slightest illumination to the space.
There was nothing else for it. Steve picked up exactly the same box as the man had, then raced round to the chocolate aisle. Natasha didn't really eat much chocolate, but maybe there was some medical element to it that he didn't know about. Maybe she needed it. She had been so upset. If the man was to be believed, it wouldn't be anything like a romantic gesture. It would be more like first aid.
'Mr Osborn was very clear of what we needed to do if ever this building was uncovered,' he said. 'Destroy everything. So we have EMPs planted everywhere. Getting rid of your little suit too, that's just a bonus.'
. Of course it was. Hadn't he known that, the moment he had laid eyes on him? Hadn't something inside him looked and Barnaby and said,
This wasn't like normal. Usually, he sketched onto his canvases first, carefully building up lines, selecting colours one by one, getting help with the ones he couldn't distinguish between to make sure everything looked right. This was different, wild, he was almost throwing paint at the canvas, stabbing with with brush, trying to empty all the pain and anger and frustration that was too big to keep in, too much to process.
Only Peter wasn't helpless. He was really smart, and, thanks to Mr Stark, now he had awesome powers. Okay, so he hadn't really had time to try them out yet, but he could definitely climb walls and move really fast. That had to be helpful, right?
'Certainly, sir,' Jarvis said, sounding almost pleased. Possibly because this was the first request Tony had made to look into his family's archive since testing that the software worked almost a year before. The idea had been to offer Stark Industries' competitive paid internships to fields outside of STEM, and the only thing he could think of was getting a bunch of History and Library Management Studies students in to digitise his family's extensive private archives; everything from his ancestors' diaries to Howard's lab books and research notes to photographs, film reels and newspaper cuttings. He'd taken on three interns at the start of the year, run thorough background checks, buried them in non-disclosure agreements, and then let them loose on the old mansion where it was all stored. Even now they had only cleared two of the five floors, but they had just finished with his dad's Captain America collection, or as Tony called it, the freaky stalker collection. It had weirded him out a bit when he was growing up, but now he was glad of it. He intended to present Steve with any personal effects in the New Year, along with a full list of items to see if there was anything else he wanted. He'd thought about doing it as a gift on Christmas day, but somehow it had felt unfair to return Steve's stuff and pass it off as a present. The benefit was that now, if Steve had somehow had anything to do with the song, his dad would almost certainly have details of it.
‘Then you know there was nothing wrong with them. I was just giving the kid a bit of science and tech talk, a bit of mental stimulation, which, let’s be honest, he wasn’t getting from you.’
Guards dispatched, he ran from the room, into the hall, and in the direction he hoped was towards the bridge. Two more Skrulls came out and he took them out without pausing, and that made nine. He just needed a window, some way to see where he was.
. The thought struck him as strange. He could hear it being said, in Tony's voice. But it was the wrong way round. He loved Tony. Tony didn't love him. Tony wouldn't say those words to him.
Except he wasn't really thinking about Mr Stark, or only a little bit. There was only one person he really wanted to see right now. He wanted his dad.
. She wanted to set him up with the red-head girl she hung around with. Well, it made sense. People were always thinking he and Pepper were a thing. It was the natural assumption.
It is understood that members of Stark Industries' board will mount a legal challenge concerning Mr Stark's mental competency, but as he has already been debriefed and cleared by representatives of the military, FBI and CIA this is unlikely to succeed. It seems that there will be a long and messy legal battle ahead and a further period of uncertainty for the employees and investors of Stark Industries.
It wasn't his fault. Tony was moving way too fast. They had too much complicated history to rush things; they were still trying to reconnect; in a lot of ways they still didn't even
'What?' Steve asked. He noticed Tony was shivering, and struggled to his feet to fetch his coat from where it was draped over the rail of the steps. Tony got cold easily these days.
'Got no plans to,' Tony said, letting Steve go anyway so they could move in to give their own hugs and congratulations. Tony had booked them all into a fancy restaurant for dinner, but Steve had absolutely no intention of going. He eyed Tony hungrily. He preferred his own plans for celebrating.
On the front of Tony's fridge, half obscuring a child's drawing, was a neatly bullet-pointed plan of action, held up by thick electrical tape.
. Somewhere he could still hear the animal noises of pain the him strapped to the table on the Skrull ship was making.
'I'll climb out the window.' Maybe he would anyway. Though, as much as he cared about Bucky, there was someone else he'd want to see first.
Steve was thinking something, Tony could tell, but he was dammed if he could tell what. Why wouldn't Steve
For a moment Thor was shocked, but then, what more natural than a proposal in the heat of battle? When the blood was racing, when the danger brought all passions to a fever pitch, of course the two warriors would choose this moment to make their promise. Thor let off a few celebratory bolts of lightning streak across the sky like fireworks, and then set to taking down their enemies with a renewed vigour. If he knew Stark, the post-battle revels would be particularly spectacular today, and, more importantly, Thor would finally have opportunity to bring out
He could feel the multiverse. They got it wrong so much more often than they got it right. But it was always them. They always found each other, no matter what.
On the one hand, Tony knew this conversation was important. It was the first time Steve had ever talked to him about
'So...' He said, slowly, trying to stop the break in his voice. 'I'm not getting Venom back, ever, am I?'
'I'll be back in a second,' he told Peter, and followed Stark out into the corridor, having to jog to catch up with him.
First Meeting – Once all four previous steps have been completed, the marriage candidates are finally permitted to meet, either alone or with parents present, and are able to begin to get to know each other. Depending on the families involved, they may be expected to agree or refuse the marriage at the end of this meeting, or may be allowed to try
‘Stark, it isn’t up to you and Peter isn’t up to it. You need to go.’ Steve turned his back on him firmly, heading for Peter’s room.
She wanted to ask why Steve hadn't come himself, but couldn't. Except Rhodes, who knew her so well, told her anyway. Steve had been worried about her. Steve had noticed she was embarrassed yesterday. Steve had thought, if he was there, she might be too worried to get the help she needed. Steve knew they were close, and thought maybe she would be more comfortable with him.
. Steve ran to the table, removed the tube, and set about undoing the straps. A moment later, Stark came and began bandaging Peter's wrist, impossibly gently. The extra tentacles had gone now, and somehow, there wasn't a spot of blood on him.
'You are not authorised to enter,' the door said, politely. 'Please desist or action will be taken.'
‘I need your number,’ he said, or tried to. What came out was a mess of strange, slobbery, guttering sounds, as if his tongue had melted away with his vision.
‘I thought you probably lied to your mom about doing some chore,’ Steve said, suddenly wondering why he had assumed that. Possibly because, after forgetting to take the trash out the night before, he had snuck it out this morning but told his ma that
When Steve woke up on Peter's fourth birthday, he lay in bed and wondered if this had been a good idea. He wondered whether Stark would even show up. Then he wondered if he wanted him to or not. On the one hand, Stark was definitely a very bad influence. On the other, frankly, Peter's life expectancy wasn't really long enough for bad influences to be a problem.
Tony had reached the ground floor now and stood before Steve, hands in his pockets. 'True. What a healthy start we've made to this relationship.'
He tried to go back to sleep, willing himself to escape the shame, to get better, so he could get up tomorrow, be
Feeling emboldened, Steve asked, 'Uh... well, you probably guessed these aren't for me. And I've never done this before. Does she need anything else?'
And a big thank you as always to everyone who reads and comments! Your encouragement means so much <3
It was horrible. It was the most disgusting thing she had ever had to deal with. She became detached from it; the only way to deal with it was to pretend it wasn't happening.
'No, it wasn't, it was childish and cruel. You needed me and I was more interested in being jealous.'
The bouquet was so large that Steve could scarcely get it through the door. It would be too big for a single vase, he knew, but it was exquisitely arranged and he did not want to break it up; at least not yet. He managed to stand it in the sink, then settled himself on a chair to look it over properly.
Steve scowled. Bucky was right, of course, he was on multiple medications that did not mix well with alcohol; but at this point how much sicker could he really get?
Steve was silent for a minute, then, in a small, horrified voice, he said, 'But... I mean, they cured
And so he did. At first, Thor wasn't sure. After thousands of years of making up the ledger by hand, he wasn't at all sold on the idea of a digital version. However, once Tony showed him how to save pictures and to print them, Thor was enthralled, and excused himself to his room to go and explore this whole new world in privacy.
'The person was... I was with a boy,' Steve said. He wasn't looking at Tony and Tony was glad, because the words were exploding over and over in his head, immediately sobering him up, his thoughts racing, because if Steve had been with a guy in 1938, maybe that meant he wasn't straight, maybe, maybe, maybe. Tony's breath hitched, and Steve obviously mistook it for a gasp of surprise, because he continued miserably, 'Bucky was furious. At first he thought... the guy was much bigger than me. What you'd call a butch type these days. And I was so small and scrawny that at first he thought... but I told him he was wrong. I tried to tell him, I wanted to tell him, that...' Steve took a deep breath, and finally gave voice to his thoughts, to his real feelings. 'That I liked men. I liked women, girls, too; but I was equally attracted to men. Except Bucky didn't want to hear it. He cut me off before I could say it, he was worried that someone would overhear and get the police, he was angry at me for being reckless. He didn't let me finish, he told me to never say it out loud, to forget about it.' The words were pouring out of Steve now, and he wiped tiredly at his forehead, smearing wet over it from the washing up without seeming to notice. 'After that, he started pushing me onto girls more. Setting up blind dates and double dates and all. I think he was hoping I'd forget about that part of me, that I'd fall for a woman and get married and have kids and stay out of jail. I had no idea he regretted it.'
Tony pretended not to hear, examining the smashed stereo. 'You cut it off before the best bit,' he complained. 'I'm not sure if I prefer the bit where you ask for
The stranger erupted out from under the table, taking the seat opposite Steve without a hair out of place. Or, more accurately, his hair was all out of place but it suited him perfectly. Steve wanted to take him home and do terrible things to him. He'd never felt drawn to anyone like this before, a yearning like a physical ache in his stomach, worse than any ulcer. He felt nauseous. This was why Steve could never get a date.
Standing abruptly, Steve wrenched open the closet and hauled out a large canvas only just narrow enough to fit. His art school had given it to him for a project shortly before he had been forced to drop out. Another thing he had to thank his broken body for. With his free arm he swept the ring box off the dresser, along with his deoderant and comb, making room to prop up the canvas. Then, he started to paint.
'I'll find you soon,' Bucky promised. 'Go mingle! Have some fun!' With that, he disappeared back into the crush. Steve went back to scanning the crowd, then, trying not to look too conspicuous, he stuck his head under the table cloth.
was. If the shadows under his eyes were any indication, he'd probably been craving a quiet night on the couch too. But here he was, having fun simply because Steve was.
The last of the group filtered out of the room, followed shortly by the Science teacher, who still hadn't quite forgiven Tony for being more knowledgable than him and blocked the door when Tony tried to get in.
'I... I made a mistake,' Steve said, his voice thick with fresh tears, but he suddenly pulled away from Peggy, sitting upright and away from her at the far end of the couch. 'And now I've ruined everything. I've lost someone and I'll never see them again.'
'He's fine. He just won't be getting his phone back any time soon.' Stark said, lazily. Then, abruptly, he asked 'So how did you even end up with Peter?'
The toddler on Steve's lap was already giggling, joyous with anticipation. Tony couldn't help but smile too at the sight and sound of them together. It was all so right, so perfect, and it made all the struggles and stress and sleepless nights worthwhile. He had never known life could be like this.
Peter was back on the floor again, holding himself up on Steve's knees. He was still now, considering, looking back and forth between his parents.
When the bell finally rang, Steve insisted his friends go ahead. He needed a minute to get his bearings again, to prepare himself. His first class was English, and he thought the teacher would understand if he was tardy just this once. As the halls emptied around him, he treated himself to a few deep breaths, trying to shake off the weird feeling. Then he straightened up, slammed his locker shut, and turned towards class, only to be stopped in his tracks by a voice saying, 'Steve?'
With that, he was off, a seething mass again, a huge roiling mass of tentacles. Steve wasn't sure where they had all come from. Still, one thing was clear – The monster controlling Stark wanted him to follow. And maybe that meant it was a bad idea to follow, that it would turn out to be a trap or that the creature would try to kill him, but there was no way Steve was going to hang back. Not when that thing was going to be passing through a city of innocents.
Realising his mistake in an instant, Tony moved to snatch up his notes but it was too late. Osborn had already picked them up and begun to rifle through them. His eyes narrowed even more than Tony's had.
'There's no law against trying to woo a pretty penniless girl who ought to be grateful,' Stone said, sneeringly. 'Not like some relationships going on in this town, right, Sheriff?'
Tony could pin him to the wall right there and then, get what he wanted, and never see him again. He could take him and then crush his skull and watch him die. He could be on his way in ten minutes, back to his normal life.
Steve must have felt her body tensing, because he said, sounding considerably mortified, 'You know, up until you asked for them I thought tampons were condoms for ladies.'
and Steve had never felt more strongly in favour of it. He went back to massaging his right leg, which was aching way more than usual. Or maybe he was just noticing it more because he was already in a bad mood.
'Sir,' Steve said, putting his file down, and Tony could see his own picture there along with several others. 'What is this?'
It occurred to him that he ought to get Thor to come with him, but when he turned to look Thor had swept his sister back onto the dance floor and she was bearing with it and smiling in such a self-satisfied way that Steve turned away, feeling sick. He'd handle this himself. It seemed like his retirement plan had just fallen through anyway.
, and told him to get dressed. When he came out from behind the screen she was gone, and Steve went home, cheeks burning, and never told anyone what had happened.
Peter was still watching the film. Steve knew his response to this was important, that what he said here really mattered, but he couldn't put himself together enough to form a proper sentence.
It was months before Peter got out of the hospital, and as soon as he came home it was clear he was going to need a lot of care. Richard started working just a few hours a week from home. Mary gave up field work and switched to a desk job, just two days a week. Steve started slipping a little more money into his rent each month, took over the grocery shopping completely, and they didn't stop him. There were happy days, days where Peter was well, and they had fun. One day he pulled himself up on Steve's knees and started trying to walk. He was christened, and Steve made his promises as godfather, and felt so fiercely protective that he would have done anything to make Peter well; but there was nothing he could do. None of them could do anything. They just kept going, fitting their lives in as best they could around a constant string of check-ups, operations, hospital stays and appointments that first year.
Mr Stark and his dad had both been at the hospital, and would know what had happened by now. Which meant that Iron Man was probably already on his way, and his dad was strong too. This guy wouldn't stand a chance. But it might take them a while to find him.
'My name's Peter!' Peter yelled out, because a hero always tried their best to save everyone, even when they were scared. 'He gassed everyone and kidnapped me! It's dangerous so you have to run!' He didn't say anymore, because Mr Osborn had slammed a hand over his mouth and pushed him further through the door.
He could see Stark's face, pale, his eyes closed. The wriggling dark mass seemed to be trying to turn back into a flight suit again. Steve paused, not sure what else he could do without injuring Stark.
Suddenly, spotlights blazed into life, flicking on and off in a way that was going to give Steve a headache, let alone anyone else. He looked to the corner of the room, where Peter was pushing the switches on and off like a pro, his face serious, his temple bleeding from where he had hit the bar. The changing light levels seemed to be working too; the mass retreated further, until it was just a small squirming thing on Stark's stomach. Steve lifted his shield to deliver the final blow, but in the next instant of darkness as Peter turned out the lights, it leapt away, disappearing into the vent.
told them, and he didn’t feel too guilty about screening them out. If there was some world-ending situation going on, they would come get him.
Too late. Stark's arms were already gone from around his waist, and he was rolling across the roof of a nondescript building belonging to Norman Osborn.
'That, Captain,' Fury replied, 'Is the Avengers Initiative.' He turned to Tony, and actually cracked a smile. 'Welcome to Shield.'
Tony turned the card over, not because he needed confirmation, but because his hands needed something to do. Sure enough, on the other side, looking innocently up at him, was the Oscorp logo. Instead of a name and a telephone number, though, there was nothing else but a small insignia, a picture of a demoniacally-twisted face, like some sort of Halloween mask, or a goblin straight out of Christina Rossetti. Tony had no idea what it meant, but it had to be Osborn.
He got to the hospital early the next morning, so early that Peter wasn't even awake yet. For a moment, Steve hung in the doorway to his room, watching him. Peter slept with his arms flung out, like he was ready to embrace the whole world. His hair was tousled on the pillow, his breathing rough and wheezing despite the tube pumping extra oxygen into his body. The precious phone was still on the pillow next to him, alongside Spinny, a cuddly spider toy that Richard had bought Mary on their first date, a trip to the zoo. Feelings were spinning in Steve's chest that he wasn't able to identify.
'No, Tony, listen. I know you have your heart set on MIT and I have no doubt you'll end up there at some point, but right now you are an eleven year old with an unquantifiable IQ fortunate enough to have extremely wealthy parents and to go to school just down the road from one of the best Science and Engineering Universities in the country. Don't pull that face, you know it's true. So I've spoken to them, shown them some of your papers, and they've said while you are too young to live in dorms-'
'No,' Steve said, flatly. 'An avalanche of permit and license requests for the Fourth of July festival.'
'That's stupid. If you can skip grades within a school, you should be able to just skip school completely if you're smart-'
'Yeah, well, you try running scans on materials made from a compound of previously undiscovered elements. I had to invent whole new pieces of equipment just to get a proper look at the damn thing. I filed like 50 new patents.'
A shorter chapter today, and somewhat filler-y, but it's been so long since I updated I wanted to get something out! >.< I will keep doing my best to update between real life and other writing commitments. We're drawing near the end of the story (we're looking at 9/10 chapters and an epilogue) so at this stage I'm determined to finish eventually!  I promise, this chapter is at least necessary filler to plug the gaps between what's happened and what's to come ;)
Somewhere in the back of her mind, she knew she was being ridiculous. She had done this every four weeks since the age of thirteen, and it had never bothered her before Afghanistan. What happened to her in that cave was disgusting, yes, but it was no reason to go to pieces. She was being ridiculous.
. Unfortunately, Steve struggled to tell certain shades apart, and he had been the one to refill the containers with fresh blooms that morning. Which was, admittedly, a flaw in the plan. ‘Sorry, I’ll just…’
He had showered. Eaten. Drunk. Not drunk any alcohol. He had fed and changed Peter, played with him, comforted and soothed him. He was getting on with life. He was refusing to think about Steve. He couldn't function when he did.
‘Really?’ Steve asked, taking his hand and pretending to examine it. ‘You must have grown some more fingers since I last checked.’
'That was an order, Spiderman,' Steve said, in his most blessedly Captain-America-esque voice. 'We need to investigate without civilians getting into danger. We'll come back to you once we've taken a look.'
'Yeah, better now, thanks,' Steve said. Stark was staring at him in a way that was making him distinctly uncomfortable, so he said, 'Well, I'd better get to class.'
That said, unfortunately the same warning still applies in regards to updates. I have basically been writing this as a break from an original project I've hit a bit of a wall with; but once I am back on track with that this will have to go on the back seat. I hope that I can finish this fic eventually, but I make no promises as to quality or frequency of updates. Thanks again for your support, and sorry for being so flaky! >.<
With that, Steve kicked hard with both his feet at the window, which shattered immediately, and in one smooth movement Steve had rolled out of it and disappeared back inside the building. Tony watched him go.
'It's weak, Shield will get it. Don't worry.' Steve brushed his hair aside, trying to see the cut. Peter kept struggling.
'Sorry, beloved, no take backs,' Steve said, wrapping the coat carefully around Tony's shoulders. On the front, an ancient, faded blue ribbon was still pinned; so old now that nobody knew what it meant.
'It's a Christmas thing,' Steve said, impatiently. 'Then you have four sticks in it, for the four points of the compass and the four seasons, because the love covers all places and times. And you put the sweets and fruits on the sticks to represent God's bounty and generosity.'
Stark didn't seem to care, pulling out Steve's seat for him and patting it invitingly before moving round the table to sit down himself. There was a bottle of red wine already on the table, and Stark waved away the waiter who was hurrying over and started to pour it himself.
'See that it doesn't. Well, sweetheart, I have to go. I'll pick you up for dinner tomorrow at 8. Wear something slutty.' He winked and left, and Steve couldn't even
It didn't take long to find him. He was in one of the outermost common rooms, known as 'The Hunting Lodge', after the style of the décor. In somewhat bad taste, the log fire was still burning in the grate. Osborn looked up and away from it, startled, when Tony burst in.
Burying his face in his hands and slumping into a chair Steve groaned, 'This is the most humiliating moment of my life', which was not the confession Tony had expected. Only, as usual, his brain was three steps ahead, and it had reached a conclusion – the only real logical conclusion, if Tony was ignoring his insecurity – that was making warmth spread through him.
'I'm not safe,' Steve croaked without thinking, but speaking was enough to ground him, make the world around him more tangible, the competing voices in his head a little quieter. He looked at her.
'Weird, but flattering,' Tony agreed, flipping through the ledger to look at the other weddings. 'And when he's put this much work in, it would be rude not to.'
Their generation had been slightly more open about the situation. Before war came, when the main priorities in life were getting a job and getting a girl, Steve and Bucky had both been turned down on more than one occasion because the girl had
'I bet we could drown them out,' Steve suggested, coming to wrap his arms around Tony's waist. Tony scoffed, but Steve could feel him squirming, pressing onto tip toe, trying to get himself into a better position against Steve's body. Delighted that his suggestion was being well received, Steve bent to kiss the back of his neck.
He wasn't going to be able to do anything, however, in the dark. He thought of Tony's beautiful electric lights as he fumbled in his pocket for a match to light the lamp, and smiled bitterly. He struck the match against the rock wall before him, and the world erupted into flame, before being swallowed by a deep, crushing darkness.
And it was true. Two days after he had woken up, when Steve had been sure Tony was stable, Peter had come to see him. It had been amazing, wonderful, and unbearable. Peter had been so pleased to see him, so convinced Tony was still a hero, a hero who had saved his life, given him superpowers, fought off a monster. No-one had ever been as happy to see Tony as Peter had that day. He didn't understand what had really happened, what Tony had done. Just thinking about Peter's unconditional affection made it hard to stop Tony's resolution from crumbling. What was this going to do to the poor kid?
Tony remained silent. When he'd played this out in his mind, he'd assumed being caught would lead to a beating. This was worse. It couldn't be true, it couldn't be, but the proof was there in the safe. He'd held it in his hands just a moment before.
'Thank you for coming,' he said, keeping it to the point, because showboating, being charming, was so not the point of this; and because he was exhausted. 'I know there's been a lot of talk about me the last few weeks. I guess getting absorbed by a monster and rampaging through the streets will do that. I know Shield's being giving you a lot of info about Venom, what it is, what it made me do over the years, but...' he swallowed. Big announcement time. No problem, he'd done big announcements before. 'It's impossible, without a full investigation, to determine how much the Venom symbiote was responsible for, and how much was me. That's why, at the end of this statement, I will be handing myself over to the authorities.'
Steve saw red. He turned, marching towards where Stark held Osborn. Obviously Stark wasn't holding tightly enough, because the bastard still had enough air to speak.
It lasted less than a minute. He'd used too much power shooting his way out into the open. The suit burnt out, and he was falling, and the last thing his swirling vision made out clearly was the entrance to the cave; he'd only climbed, he'd barely moved thirty feet. But there was nothing he could do about it, and, utterly powerless, he ploughed into the ground. Everything went black.
For a moment there was silence. Steve sighed, conceding the point, and Tony risked a smile. It was a mistake. His grin was met only with a stony glare.
The problem was, Steve walked fast. And it was so, so hot. And Tony still had no idea how he was going to get home, and he was eventually just going to have to admit to Steve what was happening, and then that would be it. No more Iron Man, no more inventing, not if he was losing his mind. It was all over. And it was
Steve opened his immediately and began to read, his brow furrowing in concern. Tony drummed his fingers on the front cover of his. It was time to state his conditions.
It was 5:30 in the afternoon. 10:30 at night in London. He should probably message Peggy before she fell asleep. It was something else he had been putting off, but right now it looked better than the homework. He didn't even really understand why he had put it off to begin with. Something hot and sad and uncomfortable just prickled in his gut every time he thought about talking to her. This time, he pushed the feeling down as best he could, and opened up a message window on his phone. He could do that, now. Apparently his ancient flip phone, inherited from his mom, had finally died sometime before he got sick and he'd finally upgraded to a smart phone.
'Well, Santa Baby, obviously. And Santa Buddy. And Eartha Kitt, maybe they met. Throw in any other search terms you can think of, and limit it to items related to Captain America only.' This last explicit instruction was the result of the thought that if Steve had met Eartha Kitt, possibly Howard had too, and if he had, he had probably gone to bed with her. Depending on how old she was. Tony didn't have the energy to find out, but either way he didn't want to risk it.
He stood up, pulling the throw off Steve decisively and ignoring his whine of protest. 'Now come on, it's time to go. It's your Christmas present.'
Suddenly, as if answering his wish, his left hand came out of the restraints and he realised that they were untying him. Realistically he knew if they were releasing him it probably wasn't for anything good, but just then it didn't matter to him. He kicked and punched and got in as many hits as he could before they managed to hold him still.
In terms of food, Steve felt it went both ways. Normal military rations barely seemed to touch the sides, but when food was in such short supply it had seemed wrong to complain he was constantly hungry. He noticed the hunger didn't make him as cranky as it used to, though, and then, out in the Russian tundra with the commandos, they worked out he could go eight full days without eating before he started to struggle with fatigue. He still didn't know how long he could survive without it, but didn't feel like testing it.
, in here all alone.' His voice had turned to an exaggerated, childish tone, and he reached forward to ruffle Tony's hair. Tony threw it away as hard as he could, which was admittedly not very hard, and sized up the cronies instead.
'You think this is irresponsible? This morning I found out I'd had a housekeeper for the last four years I never knew existed.' Tony spoke casually, but honestly, he wanted to talk to someone about this. The encounter with Ron had freaked him out more than he was willing to admit.
