I gathered myself, and went to my desk, and wrote out some letters, to old clients in high places, to Lestrade, to my brother. I had to muster all my resources, and gather any scrap of intelligence that might help me to corner the man. I might couch the threat in general terms, except to Mycroft; but every one I wrote to would care enough to bestir themselves if we were in danger. On sealing the last note I found myself struck with a rare emotion: gratitude for my friends. I generally thought of myself in plural terms only with John: he and I stood together; he and I would depend on one another. But when it came down to it, we two were not alone in the world.
Queer clubs, holding queer weddings, with the blessing of  priests, reads like a fic-writer's wishful invention. But it is actually a matter of historical record. From a tumblr post by @weeesi: "Both London and the Culture of Homosexuality AND Strangers: Homosexual Love in the Nineteenth Century talked about this. To quote from Strangers: '…marriages continued to be a common expression of love and sociality. A surprising number of priests and vicars were prepared to perform marriages for homosexual men or lesbians, and there were also many private arrangements. […] There is evidence from late 19th-century America, Britain, France and Germany of hotels rented for weddings, male brides in gorgeous gowns, exotic honeymoons (sometimes ruined by blackmailers) and bridal bouquets kept under glass in front parlours. These events were the feast days of small communities.'"
"Promise."
I left, and lost some indeterminate time in consideration, as I do when there’s no kind hand at my elbow to bring me back to earth—came to myself in the middle of the Jardins du Trocadéro as the sun was going down, still running round and round the facts of the event in my mind. It was possible that the cup had been intended for someone else. If not, if I had in fact been the target, someone had recognized me; someone who objected to my presence in Paris to a lethal degree. Was the unknown enemy connected to the work I was doing for the Général? Or was the source of the attempt the Professor? If the former, success in my endeavours would end the danger. If it were the Professor—then my flight from London had changed his plans, and pushed him to consider more reckless and less public methods of recompense for my interference; and I might expect the attacks to continue until I could bring him to court.
“What do you mean?” he said, finally.
But his eyes on me were somber, his lips pressed tight together. I was about to forgo undressing and go to kissing him at once, in hopes of teasing a little relief into that forlornity—but, “Wait, John,” said in a rush, “wait a little. Could we—Would you feel—John, would you—”
"John—" I said, but he held up an admonishing finger.
It took me an unforgivably long moment to collect my wits enough to think of it, but then, “Mrs. Hudson,” I shouted, and went down, taking the steps three at a time. “Mrs. Hudson!”
“I’m sorry,” I added, when he did not speak.
“My dear boy,” I said. “You have been through Hell.”
. Slowly I slid my hand into my pocket to finger the box.
“I - it scares me, too.” He hadn’t thought about this, hadn’t examined his own reasons for reticence, but it had become quite clear, suddenly. “I liked our privacy.”
I do miss Mary. We've exchanged notes, but I've yet to make another visit to the house. But I don't miss her in the way I think you mean. She's been a true friend to me. I hope she’s happy now. I couldn't give her that. I have sometimes believed I could make you happy, as you do me. Those weeks in Switzerland were the most wonderful of my life. Forgive me the sentimentality, but you are very far away, and sentiment is a comfort.
My dearest William,
Whatever the public may have heard in the years since, he has not left me. And I shall not leave him again. I had not imagined I could be known as he knows me, and then find that he wants all I am. It is his—my soul—so long as he has need of it.
“Yes,” he murmured. For once he did not sound abstracted, or remote, at all; he sounded as though he were very much present, and waiting for something.
He had risen to get his kit, and he paused, then, in the midst of pulling out ointment and tape, to beam at me unexpectedly.
“I can’t believe you’d never heard of such things.”
“Yeah. Huh, yeah.” A little relief in his eyes, at that.
We have discovered him. Colonel Sebastian Moran is the man; your brother will have sent on his photograph, to get your confirmation as to his height and build, but we are quite sure of it. Now all we have to do is wait for him to be a little, a very little uncautious; enough to give us reason to set the Yard on him, and get a warrant to his house. Then we’ll have him. You are nearly there, my boy—nearly home. You will not have to do without me an hour longer than Moran's good behaviour holds.
“On a ramble?”
“You keep picking up coughs and colds. From that dreadful clinic.”
“You said he died drunk.”
“Comrade?”
Enormous thanks to my betas Jasmine @darlingdetectives and Azuki @marathecactapus. As always, you helped my story sing.
Several possible lines of inquiry opened there. But I had to ask first, “Why are you glad of that? And what bride consents to be wed in a gentlemen’s club?”
“Go on, then. God.” He was starting to grin, hugely. “Go get Rosie. I’ll interrogate this one instead. But you’re going to get it from me tomorrow.”
On my arrival, I did follow John into his office in disguise, as he wrote later; and he did collapse into his chair in shock when I revealed myself, though I should hardly call it a swoon. We both clung to each other, and I will be forgiven, I think, for not recording what we said; but I shall never forget the look on his face.
I paid a distant cousin to purchase his practice, so I could bring him home at once. I had money enough, and no reason to use it but for him. To see him at Baker Street once more was all I needed.
I would not give voice to. I knew that he knew.
"And he'll find two of us to deal with if he does."
It was not. It is not. I ought to be there with you. You ought to be able to see for yourself that I am as incorrigibly alive as before, and very much with you in spirit at all times, if not in truth. Tell me you have help of some kind—that you aren't alone. It isn’t good for you.
I walked him to bed, and held him there. He slept in my arms. I lay a long time watching the shades of night pass through the room.
“He’s asked us to his wedding,” I was all I said, breathless.
They broke apart in June. I had his note in the morning post, and had him back to Baker Street by nightfall, with his few bags. He looked about him with such a bewildered, blank expression that I felt he was farther from me than the day I’d first brought him home. I made him tea, and saw him to his old room, his own bed, and then went to mine, thinking that he would sleep, at least, amid familiar things; but soon I heard him weeping. It went on for hours. He would quiet, and then begin again, worse than before. There was no bearing it.
So we went off on what amounted to a day-tour of the city. He took me to walk along the Avenue, and bought hot chocolate for us to drink, in a little place I’d never seen, full of Greeks, who laughed at my attempts to speak the language. He ushered me into St. James, and, underdressed as we were, bought tickets for whatever was playing on stage that very minute--it turned out to be a rather stunning recital by Paderewski, the new sensation. He took me to the Baths, and he was unspeakably beautiful there. The relaxation he’d intended was buried in a rush of pure unmitigated joy at his existence. He caught my eye as we settled down in the cooling room. Whatever he saw in my look brought an answering expression of embarrassed delight to his unfairly lovely face. I buried my face in the towels, instead of saying what I wished, while he did the same, with a deep, quiet laugh.
The beauty of the telegram is in its brevity: the medium forbids sentiment. I should never have found my way through everything I would wish to tell him, given the chance. I would have embarrassed myself in a letter, and even a telephone call would have rendered me speechless. I had been away from him a week. For a week I hadn’t known how he slept, or what he did, or where he was; for a week I hadn’t heard his voice. The telegraph steadied me immensely in its commonsensical stricture. I continued on to the boarding house with only a very small, niggling temptation to throw it all up and purchase a ticket home at once.
He blinked and blushed a little at the statement, or at the sound of his name; perhaps both. The use of our first names had taken on a very pleasant weight in both our minds; the circumstances under which we had begun to use “Sherlock” and “John,” within our own four walls, were memorable enough. After a moment, he sank back into his own armchair and began to make use of the pipe more steadily, letting out the smoke in slow and thoughtful streams.
John has a marvelous voice, warm and clear and dry. He reads charmingly, with little asides on the interesting bits, and small bouts of laughter when he strikes on something unexpected. I tucked myself into my arm chair, with my head on a velveteen cushion, and closed my eyes, the better to savour the experience. The heat of the fire seeped into my skin, the wind whistled in the chimney-grate, and his voice went on steadily, while the world fell to rights around us.
I didn't realise he knew what was between us, but he went and thanked me for it—for making you happy. I was thunderstruck, which amused him. You are terribly lucky in him. I do wish Harry could have met you, though I can't imagine what he'd make of you, of us.
“No.” He always asks this, now, when he comes back, whether his mental absence has been hours or days. Sometimes I don’t think he knows how long he has been gone. “I’ve been fine, here. Working. Thinking, a bit. Reading the new Journal.”
“With the money from the Strand?”
“I make no promises.”
With the distinct feeling that we were getting nowhere, and with a rising need to get out from under his empty stare at once, I stood. “I am afraid that in the pleasure of this conversation I am neglecting business of importance which awaits me elsewhere.”
“Reasonable, yes, of course,” I muttered, collecting my wits piecemeal. I leaned over to light the lamp; fumbled about the nightstand for my reading glasses. He propped himself up against the headboard and waited for me, his head bowed down, hair in mad disarray, proof proper of his mental state; he’d been running his hands through it without noticing. The letter lay in his lap, unsealed. I took it up. It wasn’t much to read: concise to the point of rudeness. The refusal was properly explained, the congratulations quite correct, but there was none of the warmth one would expect for a brother on the point of marriage. Laying it down, I attempted to muster my thoughts.
He had won. I knew it. I pleaded with him anyway for twenty minutes more, making every appeal I could conceive of; but there was no hesitation in his steady gaze. I never could dim the light of his certainty.
“I don’t know that I should.” He looked at me wistfully; then, to my dismay, shame shadowed his features; his eyes dropped. “I don’t want to upset you.”
“My brother,” Holmes repeated slowly, with that same strange hard brightness in his tone, “is marrying a solicitor called Alfred Cox, within the week, under the blessing of a remarkable priest, and in the collective presence of his club, instead of the Holmes-Vernet family party that would have witnessed his union should he have been born quite another man. But he set the precedent in his character which I have followed, and has proven incapable of taking a wife. I had not expected him to bend to tradition, after all these years; but I had not anticipated
“Don’t pity me. Respect me so far, at least.”
At first I thought nothing of it. Milverton had been to see me; he had been piqued by my interference, though barely concerned by it; and I supposed that he had written for himself, or written to some other party, a memorandum concerning me and what trouble he might reasonably hope to get me into. Death having come for him so suddenly, I suppose I thought the chance of trouble from that quarter was at an end. I wanted to enjoy my triumph, and to linger a little over the memory of Watson, in a black silk mask, tucked into the window-recess at my side, and clinging to my arm.
But as I began to find my courage, he was losing his. He was coming to me less, and quiet when he came. I thought it must be grief over Mary. He would have spoken to her; he had sounded quite determined to do it. I couldn’t imagine what she’d have said, what she could do. He didn’t speak of it, and I didn’t ask. I knew he and Mary would have to piece it out between them. But at last there came a night when he told me quite suddenly, in the very act of putting on his hat to go, that he believed they would separate. He was pale, but calm. He smiled at me, even, before he left; and I managed to keep from pulling him bodily back into the room and keeping him there with me, to defend him against the sorrow I saw in his eyes.
Then the door swung open, and Mrs. Hudson cried my name.
“Just let me get my hat,” I said. “Eat an egg, will you?”
“Sherlock,” I said, lower, and stepped up behind him; rested a cautious hand on his shoulder, through the shabby old velvet of his worn smoking-jacket; slid it slowly, meaningfully, down his arm. The corner of his mouth turned up. I ran my hand down his arm again; clasped his wrist and turned it; fit my hand into his. He sighed, and pressed it, and turned to me at last.
“It is
“I know. At any rate, no, there has been no appreciable change in my—condition. There is nothing in the literature of any use. One doctor laughed me out of his practice; another told me to drink cocoa instead of liquor in the evenings; a third recommended I give up frigging myself and pay her better attention. It cost me all my restraint to keep my seat and thank him for his time, instead of knocking him over.”
Now that I am far away I can’t do anything for you. And I have hurt you badly.
“I had thought it might help you through it,” I said, making an attempt at equal bluntness. “To be touched.” I sat down on the bed, and looked back. I had been in awe of him, long ago; had regarded him as something a little above the bewildered lot of us humanity, something cold and clear and certain. He was not. He was quite human. I should have known it sooner.
“Wear a muffler!” I shouted after him, as he departed. In his excitement he looked likely to forget even his coat and overshoes. Holmes laughed behind his paper.
“All right.” He was growing serious; he could see something was happening. He caught hold of my hand; followed me through the crowd. My heart was beating hard. I got him out into the street, in the December night. It was dark and cold, but the crowds made me feel less conspicuous; alone with him in the middle of a London street’s magnificent indifference, the cabs rushing past, the headlights shining off the wet pavement, and the neon signs blinking above us.
His politeness made it worse. He needed me, and I could not help him. I could have groaned aloud, but constrained by his silent presence I sat still, watching our breaths cloud the chilly air between us. After a minute he tipped his head back against the seat, and rested there, looking out into the night. With that reprieve I was able to compose myself a little, so that by the time we reached Baker Street I had re-formed a semblance of calm. I stepped with him into the light of our front hall, and hung up our hats side-by-side, and set his cane against the wall, while he started slowly up the stairs. He moves with more difficulty in bitter weather, and any other day I might have caught up to him and offered him my arm, but instead I stood unwinding my muffler, meeting my own gaze in the little mirror that hung there.
“No—that is to say—no. My feelings toward her are the same as ever, only—I’m afraid they may not have been enough. Not from the start.” His voice was sinking lower, his hands pressed hard together. My own began to tremble slightly. “I thought—I believed it would all be quite natural, once we began.”
He shook his head without speaking, and frowned, and finally said, “How do they know about John?”
“To what?”
“Then go! For goodness’ sake. I don’t mind. I’m pleased you told me the truth. And not just because it was flattering,” as he opened his mouth to speak. “I should be horribly sorry if you were to become afraid of me now. I like you to be honest with me. It’s the best chance I have at loving you well.”
I glanced beside me, but his expression was wholly absent. “Did you hear that your brother had taken up with Cox?” I asked, when he remained silent.
“I wouldn’t.” That, at least, I could say. I knew he hadn’t the faintest conception of why this particular topic was sensitive to the touch, for me; his trouble was all for himself and Mary, and I had to rally myself to his need. “Is she angry?”
You thought I would break your heart? I would never.
I had kept my self-command when I thought my instincts a depravity. Surely, I thought, if I granted them a better name, I could still keep myself to heel out of love for him. If he honoured his duty to Mary, I could honour it too. With that thought I found a foot on solid ground at last.
William
John comes awake with a shudder and a yell, and there’s a moment’s tussle that ends in John pinning Sherlock down in the musky sheets and kissing him, hard, and then muttering, “Toilet,” and getting out of bed quickly. He has a kind of duck-waddle shuffle-walk he employs when he needs the loo badly, which Sherlock finds endlessly entertaining. He watches him go; lies back and stretches himself out slowly, arms, legs, full body stretch and twist, with a yawn; he’s been awake for an hour, but content to lie still and listen to John breathe, and watch the dawn fill the room, and think.
I reached Berne on the second morning as the dawn broke exultant over the distant peaks. The city was spread out below me, sprawling and mortal. It took me some minutes approaching with my eye on it to be certain it was real—I had been alone with my thoughts too long already. In town at last, speaking only French and keeping my voice low, I bought a cheese for my breakfast; ate it sitting on a sunny bench outside the telegraph office while I waited for it to open. I had been traveling by night, and sleeping by day, a precaution against discovery. It was good to sit in the daylight amid humanity again. When the proprietor arrived at quarter to nine, yawning, I accosted him eagerly—perhaps rudely—asserting my need to send a message at once. I had been thinking about John, waking somewhere between the mountains and England (if he had slept at all), still unknowing where I was.
"You stand fast?”
“Then do it.” I stroked his hair, his face, and felt myself alive, with all my wounds--my heart running fast, my lungs taking in air. I felt myself quite sure of one good thing, and said, with my hand on his pulse, to feel it racing, “Marry me.”
You mentioned Mary. Have you spoken to her? Do you miss her still?
The letter sent, he went to his room. After some little time, during which I tidied my desk and hoped devoutly that this would not end in disaster, there entered an elegant, but nervous-looking gentleman with a stooped posture, black gloves, a neat little beard, and a high silk hat. Under the shadow of its brim familiar eyes shone with emotion. He bent over my chair and gave me a kiss, made strange by the false whiskers’ bristly intrusion, but all he said was, “Let me find you in my bed when I come home.”
My disappointment must have been evident, because he pulled me back into him, suddenly, putting his nose in my hair, and said, “No, John, of course not. Not if you’d like to come along. I didn’t know if you would--perhaps you’ve had enough mad Holmeses.”
"And so would you, and yet you insist upon staying here."
Next, of course, I considered the fireplace, but whatever she’d thrown in had already burnt out into a small, curled crisp. It smelled horrid—burnt plastic. Likely a failed experiment; but I’d never seen her so overthrown by anything inanimate.
“Sir?” she said.
“No,” I said, finally, defeated, and placed my head in my hands. “But I thought I might be.”
He was listening still, but with a look on his face I had not seen in years—an apathy, a kind of surrender of his courage in the slump of his shoulders and his downturned mouth. He was with me, but I was struck with the sense that something had been emptied out of him.
“I thought--” he said, when he broke away and rested his forehead on mine. “I thought I would be always alone.”
* * *
He said, “But surely I’ve caused you pain. To be accused of—by association—You called those feelings madness.”
"Marvelous," he said, gently. "I shall hold you to that. But remember I am quite uninformed. Who is trying to kill you? What will be over in a few days? Whose trial will Mycroft ensure?"
Unexpectedly, he laughed at that. His laughter is a sound so perfect, I take it like an arrow to the breast. I blinked.
“John,” he scolded me, and crossed the room to stand in front of my chair. I looked up at him, soft in the lamplight, beautiful. Mine.
Now I regarded her door and waited for a sign from the heavens that would never come. I’d been floundering about for weeks, awaiting one–should I make a move? Confess my suddenly discovered, rather overwhelming love? Knock myself over the head, and hope for amnesia? I suppose the heavens just wanted me to get on with it. It was Valentine’s Day, and there was a Heath bar and a tiny vial of strychnine wrapped in a tissue inside my jacket pocket, chosen instead of flowers. I knew I had to do or die. I marched down the hall to knock on her door. Sepulchral silence continued from within.
“Thank you, Molly.”
I put away my things, and donned the dressing-gown; sat down with a sigh, stroking a hand over the worn, familiar pillow. I had to think what was next to be done. Arrests could not be made until Monday; the precise location of each member of the Professor’s inner circle had to be tracked until then, without alarming them, intelligence finalised as to their probable escape routes, fail-safes, and suicide risk; the security of the agents involved in their collection assured. I ought to see Mycroft soon.
“He must have given up drinking.”
He paled sharply; let go of me. “For where?”
“He’s been here,” I said, “the man I am after. He threatened me, and I don’t doubt he would harm you if he thought it would dissuade me from him. Mrs. Hudson, please take the day off. Go out. Go home with your sister when she comes. Sleep somewhere else until this is over.”
“No. They’ve not invited me. They understand the risks, I think, to someone in my position; and anyway, it is quite possible that their friends would not welcome me. I do not represent their best interests, officially, however benign my private attitude. But I dined with Sherrinford and Alfred last week, and we talked over their plans at some length; and I will send a gift, of course. I had thought of a dog, but they informed me with some unnecessary amusement that they have five already.”
A week ago, in couples’ therapy, John had said, “I wish I could be normal in public with him.”
“Maybe he felt himself bound to wait. Maybe he feared Sherrinford would fall to drink again.” His voice was growing thick. He turned: looked at me with dark, wet eyes. My heart jolted at the sight--he never weeps. “Or maybe he thought I would ask, if I wanted to know. I had said I would not hear of him.”
As a man of quite another bent, to whom acting is as instinctive to my nature and as necessary to my profession as the pulse of my blood, I sometimes wonder why he trusts me. He has seen me enact a thousand characters in as many days, and in each shift of voice and breath and tone and angled wrist and changing tread I believe the chimera created appears as natural as the one before. If I were him I should not feel I knew me. I will say this: I am honest. Not with his sincerity, changeless and innate, but with the truest truth of whichever man I am creating; I never say a thing which that man would not. Sometimes I wonder if there is a way to learn what he saw in me: if there was any idea of me he held to, or if he loved me for all my selves.
“It’s not natural. It's a pathology of the mind!” I was breathless. He rose to his feet, red-faced, and stumbled a little as his stiff leg failed to hold him. He bit his lip against the pain, steadying himself. When he spoke his voice was worryingly quiet.
“So you’ve forgiven me?” he said.
The first time they hold hands in public is a chilly Wednesday. Sherlock wakes John unmercifully, with a cold nose stuck directly into John’s warm, sweaty armpit. John always sweats when he sleeps, and Sherlock’s digits and ears and nose are always freezing past September.
"You evidently don't know me,” he said. The words were threatening, but his tone was calm, almost interested, as though I were a novelty for his observation. I should have liked to stand, and look him in the eye, but I kept my seat on principle. I would not rise to his invasion.
“Is it? Do you think I am mad?”
We had bought my ticket at the station, five minutes before departure, using one of my false names. I’d taken only the Strad and my carpetbag, so that I would not have to get a porter anywhere along the route. It seemed wisest to leave as few traces of my passage as possible. I boarded ship with a forged passport and a new false mustache wreaking havoc on my sensitive upper lip. John would have laughed to watch me twitch, and warned me to try out my disguises before I used them. But of course John was safe home, well away from me. He was perfectly capable of taking care of himself—I knew that.
“What do you mean?”
“For us to attend?”
If he had been only a hired man, a bodyguard, a rough, he ought to have left as soon as the Professor fell. His work was done, his employer’s life over. But if he was one of them—if he was waiting for me—
“I thought all our kind wanted only a night’s distraction, except for me.”
"Too dangerous for you. I'll rest at Mycroft's, and meet you at the station for the Continental—second first-class carriage from the front. But think, John—Europe. We'll go together—see the ocean on the crossing, the gardens, the music-halls, the mountains, if you like. You can have as much of me as you choose." And then I broke off and blushed; but he was blushing, too, and smiling.
“Shame at being seen? Anxiety, that Sherlock will think less of you?”
“Brandy?” I offered.
My beloved is a showman before friends, a professional with strangers, and an enigma even to me. He likes little to show himself startled before he has had time to understand things. So I waited quietly until he had read the letter through twice, and then dropped his lovely head down heavily upon the chair back, to regard the firelight dancing across our low ceiling, with a queer expression. I said, “Is it a case, then?” Clearly it was not. There was every indication that this was personal news, or a private missive, at least, and from someone unexpected. But I had not been made privy to the annals of his past, except in apparently careless remarks regarding old sparring partners and comrades at university. Our friendship was old and rich, but our love affair was new. So I waited to learn how much he wanted me to know.
“Now you have,” I said. He was facing me without pretense, angry and grieving, so I looked back and let him see me loving him, and said, “What do you want to do?”
Any possibility reasoned out to the same conclusion: I could do nothing but warn my colleagues, and continue with what I had to do, keeping a sharp eye out. And no more boarding-house meals for me: I’d make my own tea in the mornings. Accordingly, I stopped to buy a kettle on the way back to my rooms, and three packets of good black tea; stopped off again at the telegraph office, to send a message to John.
“Where are you going?”
“Don’t, Holmes.”
I do not see how you could possibly appear ordinary for one minute.
“You’re thinking of that now?”
Tell me you are well and home—that you have had no trouble since you arrived. If you are safe, then one thing at least has gone right.
“You were actually crocheting in the sitting room.”
“It’s already forgotten,” I answered, but it did me good to hear him say so. I still kept his hand in mine, and nestled it in my lap; the blessed privacy of carriage-travel allowed us some few minutes to be ordinary together, before the world burst in on us again. “May I ask you one question?”
“Lock it up, will you?” he said, softly. “Keep hold of the key. I’ll tell you if I need it.” And he laughed at the look on my face. “It’s all right, Holmes. I want to stop pressing my luck, and have a little hope.”
"I know,” I said. “There was a cottage in Montpelier, with a garden behind. It was raining, and the trees were budding around us, and the swallows were returning to the fields. You’d have liked it there.”
“At his club,“ he murmured, “in Piccadilly, in three days. To be followed by dancing.” He appeared as speechless as I; that was a kind of comfort.
He drew a breath. “John. My John.” Suddenly he let go my hand, caught me about the waist and spun me round in a dance step for which I was not at all prepared. Then he kissed me soundly; and then he let me go, and went for pen and paper; and I sat down to collect myself. I will never, in a hundred years, comprehend the whole of him: he is endless wonder.
“I’m not a patient,” I interrupted, and then, hoping on my notoriety, “I’m Sherlock Holmes.”
I started at the ugliness of the word in Sherlock’s soft voice. He pressed my hand.
“My father cast Sherrinford out of the house when he was twenty-two. He’d been discovered
"He's coming here."
It wasn’t until the next morning that I went back to look at the letter properly. Within a few lines I was sobered. Milverton had written to the Professor about me. I had been following any mention of Professor Moriarty with interest for years, and had of late began to track him in earnest, in hopes of unraveling the secret of his uncanny influence over London. I had learned enough to know how difficult it would be to prove malicious intent against him, though what a difference it would make to the state of our city if I could! But now I saw our own names written out in the Professor’s hand, cultured, but cramped with ill-feeling; saw his smooth acknowledgment of Milverton’s request to end my interference, and an elegantly-worded promise to deal with me apace. I was foolishly pleased to see him refer to me as “notably difficult to touch on moral grounds,” but in the next moment my heart sank down to my toes, for the line went on, “but he may easily be reached, I think, through the weakness supplied by Doctor Watson.”
“I supposed so,” I admit, and then, “You burnt something in the fireplace.”
“No—” When he is trying to explain himself, to bring what is in his mind into the open, he gestures like an actor on the stage, displaying perfectly his hands’ full range of delicate expression. I sat back and stared. “Just now,” he went on, ignoring that, “my mind is all full of the case. I can’t understand what I am seeing, yet, but I can see patterns appearing and disappearing amid the chaos, little lights glimmering in the dark. I can usually go on examining them quietly, whatever I am doing externally; but taking you to bed is entirely different, and I don’t like to be distracted from you.—You are laughing again.”
“Thank you,” was all he said, graciously, “and good evening. It’s home for me, now. It’ll all look better in the morning,” as he put on his hat in the doorway.
“Cliche,” Holmes murmured, without rancor, as Lestrade went down the stairs, and I shut the door behind him, “the final refuge of a man unable to give comfort.” Which was an admission in itself, not lost on me: the situation had put Holmes in need of comforting.
“To have an answer? To understand my own condition? Yes.” His colour was rising. “You
“Mm,” he agreed, drifting again already. I turned to Lestrade.
"You can't sleep here?" He looked quite dismayed. That pleased me immoderately.
I found we were smiling at each other.
“Is he older, or younger?” was the question I settled on, a very small step inside.
“Oh.”
“You don’t want me?”
That wasn’t the beginning of my crush. It was more the sudden awareness of a crush already very well formed. I could have sank to my knees in the hall and kissed her sweaty neck with the reek of the mouse still in the air, but instead I walked past her into the bathroom; sat down on the toilet and whispered, “You can’t do this, she’s your flatmate.” But of course ever since I’d been irredeemably gone on her.
If you really must have something to do immediately, there is something. Forgive me for this. You might write an account of my death. It would counter the accusations the Professor’s brother has publicized regarding me. And it would further assure my security, as well as yours. I believe you could make it quite convincing. You may of course dramatise the facts as you choose; you know what the public wants to hear.
“No,” he breathed, “no.” Still he wouldn’t look at me. “But if you could have seen your face--you were shocked when I mentioned the wedding. You were.”
Nothing is right without you here, either.
“That I love him, and I’m proud of him, and I wish I could hold his goddamned hand.” John had been snarling, suddenly, and the tears had receded. Sherlock had dared to reach across and lay a hand on his knee.
It took me some moments to quell the immediate murderous impulse which rose up in me at seeing John’s name down in that hand. Until then I had not imagined him to be at any risk from my investigations in that quarter. I dropped my eyes to the page again. “Mr. Holmes has been making his way round the outskirts of my business for some time. I wouldn’t mind seeing him put away. Watson is not generally a difficulty on his own; but his removal together with Holmes’ would be preferable. He would undoubtedly work out a way to make trouble should Holmes be imprisoned alone.” My stomach turned at my John being discussed between those two miserable reptiles in this impersonal fashion, but what followed was worse and worse: A dispassionate recital of the most private and sensitive events of the year just past, John’s separation from Mary, his immediate removal to my rooms, his being continually seen in my company; the living-money being paid Mary from John’s pocket, and—what made me both furious and helpless—his continuing to send to print sensational, personal, and admittedly sentimental stories about me. It was becoming transparently evident what all this meant.
“No!” His lips parted at my vehemence. “No, for Heaven’s sake, don’t apologize.” I stopped under his stare.
“I mean more than that. I mean what I said. If it was with you, I’d be proud,” I repeated, breathless. It seemed essential that he grasp that. After a moment, his hand covered his mouth. His eyes began to flicker through indecisive shades of deep feeling, and settled at last on a kind of gleaming recklessness.
“I love you.” I was shaking.
“You can try,” I said, at last. It was an ineffectual answer, and I could hear the lack of conviction in my own voice. I rose, to get us each a glass of something, and turn away my face. He had no need to witness my dismay. But I could clasp his shoulder in comfort, as I passed him, and that was something. He took the good strong port I offered, and stayed, and let me play for him a long time. He left me at last with a look and a word of kindness; and that was a great deal indeed.
After an hour or so he grew quiet. I opened one eye to find him taking a peppermint drop from the bowl beside his chair, and opening up the notebook he’d left there, the paper set aside. He must have thought I was sleeping. I did not disabuse him of the notion, but watched him with one half-opened eye while he began to write. He is a study in earnest endeavour: he frowns, and bites on his lip, and puts out the tip of his tongue, and taps the pencil twice against a completed sentence which he finds especially satisfactory. If he knew I watched him, he would grow self-conscious; so I used to ration out the pleasure, and allow it to myself only when most needed. I hadn’t had the chance in a long while. The trouble, of course, was that in watching him I was given time to think, and it became harder and harder to contain myself, until, “Watson,” I burst out, and he started.
(See the end of the chapter for
“No, just--here, somehow,” he said, after an interminable moment. “At home.”
“You are careless of yourself,” was all he said, though, and promptly buried his feelings in the roast. I was careless, with the incautious joy of a young man who had always had his strength, so I had no real rejoinder; but I wondered very much what troubled him about me.
Sherlock has promised to take me to the old Holmes estate, some day, though it was sold to friends of friends after their father’s death--”No need for a house of that size,” he said, dryly, “nor lands, since any future young Holmeses are now quite out of the question. But we could take a tour of it. I’m glad to have grown up with the glades and meadows about us, and the wild things, and the great library, and the land rolling down toward the river; but I much prefer London, and our own home.”
“Just us.”
“We’ll pursue other avenues, I suppose,” I said, vaguely, when Holmes stayed silent. “I’ll wire you when we’ve struck something.” Holmes still didn’t look up, but raised an incredulous brow. “Well, I’ll wire you when we need you,” I amended myself. If Lestrade caught the implication he chose not to be insulted by it.
“Two hands,” he said, watching me, “one heart, till death.” He paused.
“Don’t—what?” He sounded as though I’d insulted him, and I couldn’t understand it.
“I’d thought in all that you’d have turned up something useful.” Lestrade was not gloating, as he would have been years ago. He sounded a little regretful, and wholly respectful. Holmes didn’t look up from the mess of paperwork spread over his workbench. We’d retrieved the whole from the Ambassador’s study, while Lestrade held the man fast in an argument two rooms away. But once home, no proof of the man’s identity could be found amongst them.
"My brother has directed the police, and his own men, into position, following the information I have given him. The organisation is compromised, the evidence in hand. He is finished—he cannot escape. But he knows what we are doing. He is growing desperate. He came to see me this morning." I described to John the events of the morning, and the dangers of the day, culminating in the plans my brother had helped me to lay as I sat with him over dinner, coming slowly back to myself from the fugue induced by a deep and dreamless sleep. He was right: I had needed the rest badly.
At any rate, this time I was too preoccupied to put on a good show for him. I knew that, so I went straight for Lestrade, standing over the bar, and asked him to get us drinks. John would start talking while we waited, or Greg would draw him out. Greg squinted at me. “Really? You’re letting me choose what you have?”
“Everything’s fine,” she said, and came right up to me and gave me a hard hug, with her chin on my shoulder. I could feel her laugh silently. “Everything’s wonderful,” she added, letting go, and patted my shoulder. Greg was gaping at us, but she didn’t look at him, only tucked herself back in at his side, and said, “Give him our best, Sherlock, and take him home.”
All that is true, but one letter I did not destroy. It had lain open atop the rest, undoubtedly received that very day; perhaps the last thing he had looked at, and it had my name on it. My eye had been arrested by the familiarity. I had secreted it in my waistcoat, and finished my task, and fled, with John just behind.
“And if I’d won, I could have gotten all that and more. It’s bad luck, is all. Comes to everyone.”
“But you aren’t going.”
Dearest William,
“Can you tell us what they’re like?”
“All right,” I said, and slid nearer, to tuck myself beneath his arm, and rest my head under his chin, and feel him breathe. For some minutes we lay silently. I could smell the smoke of someone’s cigar on him, and a little of his own sweet cologne. I buried my nose in the soft hollow of his neck, to chase the scent, and he laughed, and kissed the shell of my ear. His lips were cold; he had not been in long.
William
But he only looked up blank-faced from his plate and said shortly, “I wasn’t.”
He kept up a stream of information to me in our own simple code, Greek letters forming Latin words—again, no real protection, but a point against a quick perusal. The messages were hand-carried week by week across the Channel by his lackeys. He kept me abreast of the movements of the Professor and his men, the communications intercepted, the threads I might pull to unravel, bit by bit, the web wrapped carefully round the whole of London. It was a delicate task; one great tug might break the thread I held. I had to proceed with horrible gentleness.
“A month? Just enough. Please, John.”
“Watson,” I said, and he started.
“I’ll get your coat,” I said. I felt vaguely that I ought to steady him, but I couldn’t manage it; I was reeling. I’d done it. I had him. I had asked him to marry me, and he’d told me he would, and he'd cried. He'd kissed me in the street. I left him there; went back through the noisy heat of the main room, up to the bar, where Molly and Greg were standing, Molly tucked under his arm.
“I can promise you your destruction, but not mine,” he snarled, and rounding about, left the room, and I was once more alone.
“If I must,” she conceded, but doubtfully. “I’ve got a double batch of bread in, now, but that’ll be done in an hour. I suppose I could sleep over at Dolly’s.”
“For God’s sake.” I couldn’t honestly deny it. I thought a moment. “For today, though?”
"You have to go home," I said, in the courtyard, over dinner. I had thought he would take it more calmly if we were in public.
I lay awake night upon night as March sank into April, and April bloomed into May, reviewing the fifteen years past, every effort to contain myself, all the compression of my impulses and ideals into a rational, controlled, dry, clear and cold mechanisation of a soul, and the black restlessness beneath it all which would rise up to drown my senses when the better means I had of occupying my mind began to fail. I had often lay inert and unmanned beneath the worst of it, and thought my mother’s horror at me proven apt: there was madness in me. I had used syringes and fist-fights and the wonderful self-transcendence of thought to lift me clear above it; but still the subrational need surged beneath.
“I wouldn’t want it to be,” John had said, suddenly, softly. “I don’t need to be safe. I need you.”
“No,” I managed, and he smiled a bit. My mind was still spinning round the solar-blinding thought of
I suppose leaving was no joy for you, either.
I was compelled to ask, “What kind of club hosts a wedding?”
I was, of all men on earth, the least worthy of advising anyone on the subject of the marriage bed and deficiencies discovered therein. John knew this. I knew this. I sat immobile, terrified, but strangely warmed, that he should trust me so, absolutely inadequate as I was to the question. He took my silence well, considering; glanced at me repeatedly, and rubbed his hands together, and sighed again; but his shoulders had loosened, and he sat straighter in his chair.
“It’s all right.” I knew what happened to soldiers who fell into indigence after the war. If I had not found a sympathetic flat-mate, I might have gone the same way. Sherlock had helped me; talked to me, and played for me when I could not sleep, and taken me to the Baths when my wounds ached so that I could barely walk. He’d asked me to observe him, and allowed me to write what I saw, which began my independence from my anaemic pension; and finally, when I was well enough, he begged my assistance in every adventure. It was everything I needed.
“One night Sherrinford came to my door with a man, a stranger. He was almost incoherent--worse than usual. I was living in a sorry little hotel. There was no one to stop him coming up; the watchman fell asleep every night, and no one cared to wake him. Sherrinford found his way to my room even in his state, somehow, and knocked, and knocked, until I opened the door--it was the middle of the night. He asked me to give him and his companion a bed. I believe he only meant to rest. Anyway, he was too drunk to fuck.”
“Not with you.”
But as I went on I began to have doubts. How could he imagine I would have reason to disappear into the wild without a word? How much more likely that he should walk the trail to the Falls expecting to meet me, and finding me nowhere, think he had failed me utterly? That I had been kidnapped—attacked—wounded—without him there to help me? I could imagine no greater hurt to him.
with the under-ostler. The boy was just nineteen. Sherrinford would not apologize; he professed to care for his partner in indiscretion. At that, Mycroft stood up on his behalf. My father was beside himself. When Sherrinford was sent off, Mycroft went with him. They were never asked home again, but to my knowledge they were not cut out of the estate--that would have created a scandal. And Father let Mycroft write to me. When I came here after school to try my luck, my brothers were waiting to receive me.” He gave a rueful smile.
The bright morning following, when I’d gotten myself downstairs at last, and in some semblance of my normal order, or disorder, he came to the table with his cheque-book in his hand. He laid it down in front of me.
She’d always been nudgy; liked to lie draped over my lap like a cat on the sofa, or lean over my chair and rub her hands through my hair the wrong way in lieu of a greeting. It was glorious. It was torturous. I put my hand atop her hand; wound my fingers between the slender fingers, and she clung to it and said softly, “I was making you a scarf. For—” another tiny peek— “for today.“
I was beginning to feel rather strange. I watched Will set out the tea tray, and Mycroft direct his arrangement, as though from far away, suspended outside of any hurry or sense of the danger at hand. When the whole was done to Mycroft’s satisfaction, and Harry had closed the door, I heard Mycroft say, “Can you sleep a little?”
“Maybe we should just tell them.”
“Hello,” I tried to say, my tongue thick in my mouth, but received only a deep sigh in return. I fought through gauzy layers of awakening, and at last managed to turn myself over, and look into his face.
“Okay.” We don’t have a happy history with publicity. It’s a side effect of loving him I hadn’t anticipated: glass house living. Being on display. Having one’s life considered public property. “What do you want to do? An interview?”
“I’m sorry.” I subsided, a little ashamed, and considered. I was right in my facts, of course, but wrong in my approach. We sat in silence for some minutes while he ate and I nursed my cup of morning tea.
“Let’s not go home just yet,” was the first thing my boy said, when we’d gotten out-of-doors again.
Ten years after the events described above, I brought him there, to Montpelier, to the house by the lavender fields. I paid the lady of the house to take a week's vacation, and let us have it to ourselves: such is the privilege of resources. I gave him the key to the place as we approached, a calculated move. He propped his cane against the wall in order to unlock the bolt. I waited until he had the door open, and then swept him up in my arms. He would have knocked me over the head with the cane had he retained it—his reflexes remain deadly quick—but as it was he could only sputter in outrage as I strode over the threshold, and deposited him within.
I staggered. He held me up. My throat seized; I couldn’t speak. He waited, bright-eyed, holding me there, while I struggled to swallow, to breathe. “Steady,” he murmured, and then, “Hold on,” and he got us both down into my arm-chair. I closed my eyes and sank.
I remembered his care for my pride at the start, how he’d asked me no questions, and asked him none of mine. Only, “I hope you don’t plan to work for this one,” I ventured. “I won’t be earned. You’ll have to take me on faith.”
“That isn’t new,” Ella had observed, after a moment’s silence. “Your life together has never been safe.”
“Don’t you want to?” was my consequently graceless answer.
"Immensely," he said, "Sherlock, you improbable Romeo. Why here?"
My heart gave a horrid thud. I was not prepared to discuss it with him yet.
“For God’s sake, John!” He flung himself to his feet, and began to pace. “You know I would never put you in danger without pressing need.”
“Hm. Yes.”
“No. None of us were. Mycroft had just gained a position in the Ministry, and I had set up shop here, and was studying in the Museum at all hours.”
“Could what?” I murmured back.
I started down the path into the gathering twilight, pulling the straps of my pack tight across my chest. I had planned to meet John by the Falls. We’d have walked to the next village over, and at our lodgings I’d have asked him to read to me a while beside the fire. When I'd gotten up the courage, I’d have laid my head in his lap, to tempt him into playing with my hair; and at last, sufficiently distracted, he’d have set the book aside and bent to kiss me.
“To lunch, then. Coming?”
“Be warned, he plans to tell your parents next.”
“For France, as soon as possible. I need time. You aren’t safe—until I find conclusive evidence against the Professor—if I can find it. Now at least we could say truthfully we had never, if it came to court—” My voice failed me. I wrung my hands in my lap; but his face had changed again.
He clicked his tongue at me, and shook his head in a disconcerting imitation of regret. “You are clever enough—you must see there can be but one outcome to this. You have to withdraw. After all you have done to us, it is the only way. It has been an intellectual treat to watch you at work, and I say, genuinely, that I would grieve to take any extreme measure against you.”
Moriarty’s last cry still resounded in my ears. And as I walked, the memory began to mingle with the imagined echo of John's voice, as though I heard him calling my name amid the thunder of the Falls, shout after shout, growing hoarse at last and fading. I had to stop now and again and put a hand to my eyes, and breathe a little, before I could walk on.
Wordless, I bent again to draw kisses across his wet lashes, his tight-drawn brows, his lovely open mouth, until he trembled. I had never seen him so overcome. I pulled him near, and he laid his head down on my heart and wept. Astounded, I held him, feeling his breath against my neck, his life under my hands. He had waited a long time for me: I suppose the tears had been waiting too. I felt very strange, but very glad, that he would let me see.
“Tell me I’ve not mortally offended you,” he said, when I risen to the surface slowly, had begun to get my breath back with the steady pressure of his hand clasping mine, the warmth of his calm at my side.
After all I had done to be sure of him, and all that I knew of him, I
“Since when?” he demanded, and I felt my ears flush.
The bitterness infused in the word was unmistakable. “Happily for him, my parents are no longer in the world to voice their objections, and Mycroft and I will have nothing to add except our well-wishes. I suppose you’ll have to sign the letter of congratulations. Perhaps you could advise me on a gift, as well. Oh, for Heaven’s sake,” for I was staring openly. “Stop looking at me like that! I’m well aware we are not the most respectable of families, but you hardly have the right to be so shocked. I am not the one who corrupted
“I’ll plan a pudding for supper,” was all her answer, but she patted my arm before she turned back to the kitchen, and I felt obscurely comforted.
My emotions rose, and nearly choked me. I was quite idiotic in my helplessness, but he only waited for me quietly while I put my hand over my face and counted my breaths till I could slow them. Finally he asked, low, “Were you ashamed of it, then?”
I had his attention: I pressed my advantage. “Why gamble away what you’ve worked for, though?”
He did not act as though he heard me. “Are you all right?”
Beside me, he said into the quiet, “Still, he was my blood. I wanted to know him; so I ate with him in Mycroft’s rooms, or my own poor digs, a dozen times that year. Every time, he arrived drunk. He couldn’t hold a conversation. He would ask us both for money, and seemed offended when we refused him. Halfway through the evening he would suggest we go with him to a tavern, or that I, specifically, accompany him to the Park to find some soldiers for our--use. He knew about me, you see. I don’t know how, but we brothers are all gifted with some measure of that observational capacity which Mycroft has worked into a diplomatic weapon, and I have crafted into a science. It was difficult--to see him like that; to realize he expected no more for me in future than his dissipated, lonely state. It disturbed me. I knew the tendency to self-abuse was in my blood too, thanks to our father.”
He was out on a house call. His absence gave me time to think. It was not a comfortable exercise. I lay in the depths of my arm-chair, picking a hole in my dressing-gown. I had lost John once already, not by choice. I knew what it would be like to watch him leave. Would it be better or worse for me, having sent him off myself? Could I find the fortitude to pull apart the Professor’s operation on my own? But of course I would—I must. John would not be safe so long as Moriarty kept a hand on the workings of London; not so long as John kept up any association with me. I did not delude myself into thinking I would have the strength, or the cruelty, to sever our friendship altogether, even to protect him. So: defeat was inadmissible. I must win.
I, however, found my own mind returning to the thought, after the first fever of joy had subsided to a steady warmth, amidst unrepeatable nonsense of the sentimental kind and more kisses. I at last gathered rationality enough to ask, “You’ve gone hungry before?”
“You would remember that. No, I hadn’t. Nor wanted to. It should have made me think. At school, my studies occupied me, and then there was the excitement of enlistment, and my duties on the field of war; and I supposed then that I had a little more capacity for concentration than my fellows, and a little cooler blood. I could have taken my pleasure cheaply, I do realize that—but paying for a woman’s time held no appeal for me. I never met a girl I really liked, till Mary. There’s something in her—a familiarity, a sense of confidence—” He faltered, searching visibly for verbal expression. “It’s like we’re two children who’ve found each other in the dark, and held on for safety. Something in my soul trusts hers.” He had said as much in his account of their meeting. I had been struck then by the strange innocence of his feelings; but I had not lingered over it, as I was then doing my utmost to avoid dwelling on the fact of her existence. He was looking now as he had then, when he spoke of her—a little anxious, a little dreamy. “She’s a comfort to me, and I think I am to her. I feel as if I may rely on her, but—dear God.” His voice broke a little. “She feels more. She looks at me like the answer to a question she’s asked all her life.”
“I told him enough. I made it clear that there would be no more fraternal dinners. I said I wanted no news of him. I knew Mycroft would go on seeing him, regardless, and writing to him, and worrying about him, until he was drowned in a ditch somewhere, or had his throat slit by a desperate ‘bit of scarlet’ from the godforsaken Park--forgive me.”
A hand on his shoulder; John, damp and warm, in a wool pullover, with gentle eyes. He sets down the violin; kisses John’s forehead, beneath the fringe, and breathes him in for a moment. John sighs.
I had registered a step on the stair, but I was too deep in my thoughts to question the weight of it. When my door opened, I looked up expecting Mrs. Hudson with her basket, in pursuit of the laundry. Instead, I was met with a face and a form I had only seen in newspaper reports, and one photograph, folded and scarred, sent over to Nantes by my brother’s hand. Familiar, then, to me, the sunken, cold, curious stare, the stooped and hardened form, the balding, fine-featured head. Familiar, but new in their full effect, met in person. I am afraid I started when I saw him in the doorway. Then I reached into the table-drawer, and slipped the revolver I kept there into my pocket.
The next day a great goose arrived fresh from the butcher’s; and a bottle of very fine aged port followed from Mycroft’s address. I don’t know when Sherlock told him; but the proof of his approval was surprisingly good to see.
“Is that?–Sherlock, is that–?” He sounded breathless, too.
“Welcome home,” I whispered. All at once his whole face shifted into tenderness. He smiled.
“Of what?”
I sighed. No talking, then, not about anything that mattered. But I could see how he needed the air; he was shadow-eyed, and grim around the lips. “All right.”
“But—” I had thought I’d understood. I looked bewildered round the room. His writing desk was, in point of fact, untouched from its arrangement the evening before; and then I saw his overshoes left by the door, still damp.
“Clinical experience, no more. He did offer me an introduction to a society of such men, if it interested me. But he expected I would want time to consider my choices.”
I didn’t anticipate you breaking my heart deliberately. I only thought—I am a difficult man to live with. I’d imagined it would be exponentially more difficult to live with me now that you feel you love me. There are myriads more ways I may misunderstand you, and wrong you. And I have no more to offer you now than I had before. I already loved you, though I've been a very poor hand at showing it.
“You are a lifelong distraction,” I said. It was an absurd rejoinder, but he let out a laugh that was nearly a sob, and took my face in his hands again. After that there was no talking.
On the very rare occasions when he deems it necessary we socialize, I do the talking. I would think he’d like to, since he’s the one who insists on going; but he doesn’t. He likes to nurse a whisky, and hang about, and watch me talk. So I do; I find the nearest marginally intelligent looking person, pretend I’m on an investigation, and draw them out. And John is pleased, because I’m being friendly. I’m making him feel part of the group, by extension.
He only looked at me, for a moment. Then, “Never,” he said, very low, “never again, never so long away from me—you mustn’t, I can't.”
“Of air-guns,” I said, suddenly too weary to be sardonic about it.
“Thank you. Are you all right?”
He had already picked over his unappreciated dinner hours ago. I knew better than to make more attempts in that direction. I poked up the fire, and turned the lamps a little lower; spread a shawl over his chair in silent invitation, and settled into mine, to regard his bowed head, his lovely hands grasping the table-edge, nerveless. He was painfully, visibly at an impasse. If the violin would have helped him, or a drink, or a smoke, he’d have gotten it already. At this point ten years ago I’d have gone to bed. Five years ago I’d have picked up a book and pretended to read it while he paced the room. But now—I knew what I’d have wanted, weary, lonely and thwarted in my work. Ten years, five years, six months ago I’d never have dreamt he’d want the same, but now I knew I had something to give him yet.
He was tucked beneath my arm, and I couldn’t see his face; but I said to the top of his head, “I never really stop thinking; you may as well know it now.”
He laughed. “They weren’t
“Mycroft was different. He made efforts to develop himself. He was isolated, and controlled, and careful, and steady, and I thought I saw a way I could live. I determined to be like him; to be rational; to remain alone, and grow wise. I thought that was as much peace as I could hope for.”
“It was quite unexpected, actually. I had gone a month ago to meet with an old friend from King’s—Dr. Maxwell, who’s written a recent analysis of the rapid transmission of influenza amongst the lower classes. Do you know it?” I shook my head. We were on his grounds now. “At any rate, I wanted to consult with him about his methods of treatment, but as we were in his home and at our leisure, after that we fell to talking about old times.” He smiled at me. “Things are much better with me now than I’d have dared hope, then. I said so, and he asked me how you were. He thought I was still with you. He hadn’t heard I’d been married. He looked quite startled when I said so.”
“For a look at the truth I will, yes. But some truths require a gamble to be discovered. Money doesn’t. Money can be come by in more reasonable ways.”
“But—your coat. You were going to buy a new one. Yours is really past salvation. And your books—you wanted books.” He’d been delighted over that money, the first cheque from something more than his ridiculous pension. He’d been glittering with pride, overflowing with plans for it, as pleased as if it had been ten times the sum it was.
“John’s coat?” I said, to Greg, who squinted at me; pulled it off John’s abandoned seat and handed it over.
to be home,” was all I could find to say in response, and she flushed up happily, and beamed at me.
I am not alone. I met up with Stamford only last week; wrote him, and said I owed him a drink. He introduced us, after all. I suppose I feel a sort of intimacy with you in his company by proxy. I meet the ghost of you about the city everywhere, anyway, there are so many places we have been together. It used to be a torment to me, when I left you for Mary; but now it is a help.
I stood up, too, and offered Mycroft my hand.
He shook his head. “No, he didn’t. I took two shillings out of my purse; gave them to my brother for a cab-fare and a cot, and shut the door on him. I didn’t sleep till sunrise; but I didn’t repent it. To this day I don’t know if Sherrinford remembers. I don’t know whether he found a hansom to take him home, or whether they went to some hovel; or whether his companion robbed him and left him in the street.”
“Yes. Once my brothers left he degenerated, and without anyone to help--” Here his voice failed him. I reached out at last and took his hand from his lap, and held and stroked it, until he could continue.
"I will not." His answer was perfectly level. "Not without you."
“Is the crochet hook in the sitting room filched evidence of any sort?” I said, for lack of a better opener. “Or are there bodily fluids dried on it, or acid, or something?”
“What?” John, sharply.
He looked up; and then he sprang up, and stood staring. My heart began to pound.
“Again, if I must say it,” very sharply, “I always want you.” It was very nearly the same tone he had used to say, “Because I love you,” for the first time; angrily, with his face turned away. I had pressed him to say why he would not kiss me. I was nearly certain I had not misread his wishes. I hadn’t realized he, the all-observant, all-knowing, could so badly misread mine. I had not known he needed to be told I loved him too.
They go down the stairs together, a familiar rhythm, John just behind, Sherlock pulling on his scarf; step out into the cold, bright, London morning and close the door firmly behind them, and John takes Sherlock’s hand.
“Good Lord, must you speak so?” This sort of talk was unprecedented from him, and surprisingly painful. “It isn’t really a molly-house, is it?”
* * *
“I think they’ll be all right,” he said. “My brother looked--I hadn’t seen him like that. He’s changed. I might go to see them. They asked me up to the house.”
Sherlock’s look was inexpressible. “You ate with them? Asked them to your suite?”
It had been a long time since he had ordered me anything, and I sank into his decisive air, and reveled in it, as he pulled off my gloves without waiting for permission, and shook his head over the split and bleeding skin.
Anyway, he was going for the kettle when he saw them, and he stopped dead. His hand twitched, and then he turned around to look at me. He looked almost angry: wide-eyed and silent. I said, “What?” I might have sounded defensive.
“You want to attend?”
He looked sideways at me, apprehensive, but nodded.
“Don’t mind me, it’s just that I’m happy,” was my poor attempt at an explanation, which flustered him further.
”Come upstairs,” I said, and started away without waiting for an answer. He followed me silently up the stairs, through the dark. He no longer hesitated even a little at the threshold of my chamber; only stepped inside and stopped, and watched without shame as I removed my cravat, and began slowly to undo my shirt-front. No one who has not known a love inadmissable, maligned and dangerous, can understand the remarkable sensation of being watched openly by someone you have wanted.
At some point, I realized Lestrade had handed me a drink; it was cold in my hand, and that brought me back to myself. It took me a moment to find John, but he was watching the game, perched on a bar-stool beside Greg, both of them cursing happily at the activity on-screen: as I’d hoped. He didn’t need me to talk for him, with Greg around. I took a sip and found it was gingery and sweet. Lestrade was better at choosing for me than anticipated. The fear in my gut welcomed the sugar and burn of it as a kind of comfort. I looked round at John again, soft-edged in the low light. He is so many things for which I will find no words, but just then all I could think was
“Holmes. My dear fellow. You will find what you need. You’ll stop him.” He sounded quite sure. “You will return. I will wait for you, if I can’t come with you.”
As to the sentimentality, I feel quite the same, though I haven't your gift for expression.
I heard his cry suddenly silenced below. In the stillness that followed the roar of the Fall rose once more undisturbed. For long moments I stood panting and stunned on the very edge of the abyss, while the mist of the falls rose cold around me. He was gone. It was finished: we were free of him.
"I cannot let him loose on Europe, to begin again! Heaven help whatever nation he chose for refuge. John—Watson. You would not wish him on anyone. If I could end his career I would consider mine complete. I could retire in the country, to my chemicals and my philosophy."
“They’re so human,” she said, and sat back against the bar. “They’re such ordinary stories, but that’s the good of them–they make it feel all right to be human. Uncertain of yourself. It makes you think you could find a way to be happy as you are.” She smiled at me.
“You didn’t know,” I said. “You couldn’t have known.”
“John.” Ella always sounded the same, slow and interested and unruffled. It had bothered Sherlock at first. “I’m sure you don’t. Our first thought is the one we’ve been conditioned to have, do you understand? It’s the one we’ve absorbed from someone else. The answering thought is your own. What is your answering thought?”
At the end I rose. "I have to go. You are more at risk every minute I stay here. Mycroft and I will tidy up my end of the affair this evening before bed. I needn't be present in England for the arrests; and I have enough funds to take us anywhere—I've come into enough, through the last few months' work, to make us comfortable forever. We can do anything we like. I'll meet you in the train—I'll take you to France. I'll show you everything."
I couldn't find words. I shrugged, and he let me be; turned to examine the place. But that night, after I had walked him down to the river (the stoat's burrow was gone, but the last sunlight hung golden in the haze over the water), and played for him, and taken him to bed, he said suddenly into the stillness, "Is it because you missed me here?"
“And—have you?” They had seemed so eager to take up the reins of married life. It hadn’t occurred to me they could be anything but happy together, in spite of my own misery over it all.
My dear John,
“All of John’s stories, yes. He’s subscribed to the Strand expressly for that purpose.”
He took up the paper from the stand, and turned over its pages slowly. “Well, then.”
“In Islington, I think, but this was sent from the club’s address.” Standing, he reached for his pipe and dug a pile of shag out of the Persian slipper with slightly unsteady fingers; packed it in with slow imprecision. “I suppose I ought to be glad he hasn’t chosen a hotel for the great day.”
“Harry wouldn’t know your size,” I said, staring at it too, and picked up the hand and kissed the little, rough finger with my ring on it; I couldn’t help myself. He laughed again.
I flung myself down into my own chair and stared. I was used to his reticence and the dignity that demanded it, but this was new—to be denied even a glimpse at what worried him, for fear of my taking offense. “As I wish to be your friend,” I said, trying for a calm and reasonable tone, “that isn’t possible. Whatever's troubling you, I want to help.”
“I mean—I am not able to love her. Not—I don’t mean I don’t care for her, but—in our own bed, I can’t love her as I should. I can perform the act, but only just.” He gave me a quick little look and went back to staring at his knees. I was speechless. He went on, “I suppose you’ll say that’s my own private business.”
“Sherlock,” I said, “I’m coming in.”
“No. That is--I don’t know. John--” he turned at last to look at me; his gaze was fathoms deep. “Perhaps I had better explain what happened.”
He stood watching me openly while I waited. Something shone in his gloved hand: a knife, most probably. His stance was patient: a trained man, used to waiting for his quarry, confident of his capacities. I might have anticipated this: I had been hunted for three months, and why should it stop because I had come home?
“I love you,” he said. “I have for years; I know that now. And,” growing gruff, “if I must go I should like to kiss you first.”
Because it was all going so well. We were comfortable. We liked each other, and we even managed to say it aloud. Now that we’d managed to get here–to the point where kisses and quiet nights side by side on the sofa doing our own work, occasionally reaching out just to be sure of each other, and flowers, and regular hugs, was all normal, a foregone conclusion-it seemed strange to ask for more.
“He should be in the dock in three days, and we will be safe."
He shook his head at me. "You would not retire. You'd last three months, and then some enduring injustice or some badly-hidden secret in the neighborhood would catch your eye, and draw you back into the fray again. You forget that I know you. I know that you cannot leave a man like Moriarty alone, to do what he does to the innocent. But there are always men like him. It will never end. No,” as I started to speak, “listen to me. I understand, you have to do this, now. You have to meet him. But Holmes, you know me, too. You know I can't leave you alone in it. It is impossible. Don't ask it of me."
“You must drop it, Mr. Holmes.” His head swayed a little on his thin neck. I suspect the unsteadiness heralded early palsy, but the motion put me in mind of a poisonous snake, gaze fixed on its prey.
“Only thinking,” which was true enough. “Watson, has anything happened?”
“He’s planned a wedding,” he murmured. “He’s kept up a club membership, and a home, and a long-term liaison. I don’t understand.”
I have a very great deal to tell you about my current reading and my experiments, and some theories I am developing regarding agriculture, most notably the cultivation of the bee-hive. It would not do to write my thoughts out now—I want to see your face as I tell you. Your eyes are a particular joy of mine. That was (truthfully) a good part of my motivation in bringing you into the cases, to begin with: to watch your eyes’ changing expression as you discovered the truth, and delighted in it.
This is the longest I have ever had to appear ordinary.
“Excuse me,” I said, and I went directly over to John, and tugged on his hand.
His face showed no emotion, but his voice had dropped lower, and his fingers were picking and tugging at the hem of his coat. He was entrusting me with something significant. I dared one more question. “Mycroft handled the arrangements, and not Sherrinford? Even though he is the elder to you both?”
“I’ve heard that, too,” I said, and I knew the change in me was audible when she scrambled to sit up all at once. She was blushing. She was blushing over
As to the idea that you can do nothing for me when you are gone: You are with me still. You are always with me. I write you out of my head onto the paper, because you are always in my head. I fill my pipe and think about you. I hear a boy singing in the street and think about you.
But I had to know that he knew I was sure. I had to make sure that the whole world knew I was sure. He deserved that, after everything. I wanted him to look down at his finger a dozen times a day and see my ring, and never wonder again if I would leave, or if I’d forget that he was the most fascinating man in the world. I suppose I needed that, too–to find out if he’d promise me. To see his ring and be sure. Sometimes I still forget he really loves me.
“Sherlock,” said Ella. “You look uncomfortable. What are you thinking?”
“Hmmm,” he said, indistinctly, into my mouth, and then, “Put it on your blog, and come away with me.”
For a little while I had thought my greatest, probably my only chance at happiness was ruined. But after a very little while I began to be astounded at myself for wanting him so, to the wreck of everything else I cared for, studies, dignity and home, and despised myself for my weakness. I had wasted my mother’s confidence in me for the sake of a tryst. Had Victor asked me to go away with him till the trouble blew over, or had he made any attempt at all to defend me to them, I might have sustained my feeling for him; but at my mother’s orders he’d left me there and gone off without leaving me any token of his care, any sign that he might wait for me—without hesitation, it had seemed to me. He’d made no effort to speak to me again. Left alone, it seemed obvious that I’d surrendered my good sense without provocation to the worst kind of base emotionality, and paid the cost. I had promised myself never again to let sentiment so cloud my judgment.
“But that was the last of it,” I said, because it was clear in his tone.
But his answer, when it came, began, "My dearest."
I went to my room to get out the little prayer book, and the token I had bought for him. With them in my hands found I had to sit down. I have loved a few times, and lost every one; traveled a wide world, with very little comfort in it. I have known my share of good times, along with trouble, but never a happiness like this. And now I was about to make vows to him. I would never do anything again, I thought, that meant so much.
The confrontation between Holmes and the Professor is paraphrased pretty directly from Doyle's version in "The Final Problem," going on the principle that Holmes probably remembered it accurately and Watson would have no reason to change it. I also took Doyle's comment that Holmes was staying with Mycroft during the short time he spent in London, and played with the idea.
That is all good news. I am especially glad to hear it satisfies you. I had wondered whether you were still as sorry as you were that you had lost her.
When at last he turned to me, Mrs. Hudson had come and left with our dinner long ago; I had lit the lamps, and settled myself before the fire with a cigarette; thinking of how little I knew of the history of him. His eyes, when they found mine, were dazed; he looked as though he were waking from a trance. “John,” he said, sounding half-stunned, and then louder, “John. Are you all right?”
After four months he began to smile a bit when I teased him, and read aloud with me in the evenings, and even consented with a laugh to accompany me to dinner when I asked as prettily as I could. After five months he had re-established his practice at a new set of rooms in the center of the city, and begun seeing to the health of the Irregulars in his spare time, as well as the recovery of as many as he could reach on his Saturday charity calls. Sometimes he still sat blank-faced, slumped at his desk, staring down at the empty sheet which had been meant to receive a story from his pen. But then he would shake himself, and stand, and fetch his walking-clothes, returning after some hours abroad with a look that was somber, but clearer; and watching his efforts, I began to feel we would recover him after all.
I said, “Yes,” and I hugged him.
“No.” He gave me a small smile, a silent thanks for the proffered escape. “It’s all right. My mother died of lock-jaw when I was ten years old. They brought me home from school, but they didn’t allow me to see her until she was in the casket. My father broke his neck in a riding accident fifteen years later. He was with a hunting party; they had been drinking, and the sun had nearly set, and he tried a jump his horse couldn’t manage in the dusk without firm guidance.”
