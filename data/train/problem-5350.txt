“What if I promise to have you back here by Monday?” he asks. “Would you be able to help then?”
“Here goes nothing,” he mutters. He heaves himself out of the car and jogs after Cas.
—like he was buying a jug of milk, not beating the shit out of the guy. He hasn’t even broken into a sweat. The guard’s walkie talkie crackles to life. “Delta come in. What’s your position?”
harmless, but he’s got the stickiest fingers Dean’s ever seen. “I wouldn’t consider Jack harmless.” He glances over at the kid. “How old are you, anyway?”
“There’s another safe,” Jack says.
The reminder sours the coffee in Dean’s mouth. He sets down the mug and pushes it back towards Cas. “So, Sam called you, huh?” Dean asks Bobby. Might as well cut to the chase, since Sam has to leave so soon. “You here to tell us about Azazel?”
The thought has barely crossed his mind before the door opens. Cas winces, but it isn’t Dean in the doorway.
how old you are? Don’t you know when your birthday is?”
Charlie would kill him if she could see him now.
Cas nods solemnly. “I accept your terms.”
“Can’t believe my dad never told us,” Dean groans, after he knocks it back. It burns warm in his chest. “What an asshole.”
A walkie talkie screeches to life. “Sir, uh, we’ve, uh. We’ve got a problem.”
“Sure.” He holds up a finger. “On one condition.”
“Dad. It’s Dean.
Sam hides a laugh in his coffee mug as Dean’s face transforms into righteous indignation.
Sam shrugs. "It's weird. I used to think that Stanford is where I would have ended up if mom was alive." He laughs. "I used to think mom being alive meant that we would've had a normal life. But hearing Ellen talk about her--hearing how much she loved the life.... I don't know anymore. Maybe our life would've been just as fucked up
Cas is already stalking up the front walkway, dressed in Reggie Baker’s uniform. His face doesn’t twitch at Charlie’s compliment. He unlocks the door without even looking at Dean, holding the door open for him to slip inside.  Apparently, they’re going to try and do this job without acknowledging each other. Fine with Dean.

Dean pauses, squinting at Castiel. “I don’t believe in fate.”

--wait, you’re my
He doesn't quite nail the blasé tone he's going for; his voice is too shaky and all over the place for that. But he gets the words out. Sam's eyebrows fly up his forehead and Garth starts choking on a tortilla chip. Charlie has her hands clasped breathlessly at her mouth.
Sam makes a noise and savagely scratches through something he’s written and it
On cue, Cas comes running out of the building. Behind him, an alarm starts blaring. He runs faster. He jumps lightly into the back of the van and pulls the doors shut behind him. At the sound of the doors shutting, Charlie punches the gas and peels away, tires squealing.
ringing in Charlie’s head.
Before they can move out, the door opens again and Baldy comes back through.
“No! No they took it!” His eyes are rolling wildly. “It was Castiel! Look for Castiel! He did it!”
let us know you’re alive?” Dean sighs, heavy and world-weary. It’s not exactly the first time John’s been unreachable, but this time feels different. “We know you were talking to some guy named Frank. I don’t know why, but. Damn it. Just call me back.
. We’re getting read to go after the ledger. Sam’s here too. But what the hell were you doing with this Free Will place? Can you
Jack takes an aborted step forward, face screwed up.
“Hey,” Sam says with a grin. “You’re finally up! Happy birthday, man.”
“Yeah, they got the tires man. I chased ‘em off, but they’d already put it on blocks—if you know who owns it, they should probably take a look—”
” he says. “
A whiff of coffee hits his nose and he glances over at his nightstand, surprised to see a steaming mug resting there innocently. He lets go of Miracle, but she doesn’t go far, pausing only to shake out her fur and settle back down into the warmth of his blankets. Dean blinks at the mug. There’s a little note resting next to it, with careful, too-even letters spelling out DEAN.
“I hear you,” he says aloud. To Miracle. To himself. To the fucking universe, maybe. It only took him 42 years, but he’s listening. “I hear you.”
them. I want to make sure they can
“Cas, I should’ve told you this as soon as we got you back. But I wasn't sure how to—”
Dean smiles at him. "Thanks, Cas. Hey, uh. You're sticking around too, right?"
“It was worse than Purgatory,” he complains. It shocks another laugh out of Sam.
It’s a question that’s plagued him for most of his life.
. He will never understand Dean’s obsession with trying to make their dad proud. It never works.
Dean grinds to a halt. He can’t even bring himself to smile at the hostess as she walks away.
, Dean isn’t doing this for Cas. If he was, Cas would’ve been having significantly more fun. For once, Dean is trying to do something for himself. “I’m sorry, Dean. I thought. I… It seems I was being selfish. Sam and I both were.”
“Jesus Christ,” Sam groans. “You’re just as bad as Dean!”
Dean realizes belatedly that the voice is
and John had almost driven off the road—
do you know that, Castiel?”
Charlie snorts. “Don’t look at me. That is all your brother, dude.”
Kevin lets out a humorless laugh. “Yeah, well. My life has been destroyed. I don’t know what else to do.”
They fall silent as the bartender comes back by, replacing their empty glasses with full ones.
Dean has doubts he’ll ever see Jack after tonight, but Jack is appeased by his answer and quiets down. In his earbud, Charlie directs them to a door with a key card reader. Dean swipes Reggie’s keycard, but the reader beeps red. The door stays locked.
,” Sam says. “
Jack punches the code in with nimble fingers, and the door swings open.
Jack snorts some beer up his nose. He’s only had a glass, but he’s already tipsy. Dean is pretty sure this is the first time the kid’s ever had a drink.
Dean doesn’t get it.
Jack showed up and was immediately put on dish duty. Sam had looked mortally offended on Jack’s behalf, but Jack didn’t seem to mind.
Jack grins.
. As in me and Sam. Okay,
It’s an amateur mistake—to break in somewhere without knowing everything about it. His dad would knock him upside the head for it. Hell,
Dean plucks the napkin out of Sam’s hands, rereading the instructions even though he has them memorized already. “I don’t have another option. It’s not like you’re offering to help.”
Especially when he steps forward and backhands Dean across the face.
“Dean,” Sam says helplessly. “Stop. This is a terrible plan. No wonder Dad got caught. You can’t just waltz into places like this.”
“Cas—what—” Dean stumbles along behind him. “Cas, what are you doing?”
, Sam. I’ve got a partner. A hacker. I don’t—I don’t know about Dad. Pretty sure he’s been alone.”
“Almost got it,” Jack breathes.
“Yes,” Cas tells him. “Well. Not
“You—"
Charlie’s been Dean’s getaway driver many times before, so he knows that as soon as those back doors shut, you better get low and hold on for dear life. Cas, of course, doesn’t know this—so when Charlie presses her foot down, his eyes blow wide and he stumbles back and forth for a few seconds before tumbling down in a graceless heap.
“Yes. What
“A lady never tells,” Charlie says primly. “And a gentleman shouldn’t ask.”
“Uh, no offense,” he says. “I don’t trust thieves.”
He brings his fist around in a solid hit and Zachariah slumps in his grip. Cas follows him down and keeps hitting him. He doesn’t look bored anymore. He looks furious.
“Lucky guess.”
“No,” Dean says. “It’s alright. Let’s go.”
The next morning dawns crisp and clear. Everyone is huddled in Charlie’s van and there’s really not enough room for seven people, but they make it work. Dean tries to relish it. This is probably the first and the last time all of these people will be together.

“For what?” Dean spits. “Money? A statue? What the hell was worth a
“I’m Dean Winchester,” Dean says, his best smile stretched across his face. He looks at Cas expectantly. “And you are…?”
Reggie’s eyes sharpen. More concerned than suspicious now.
Oh yeah. This is gonna be fun.
Cas offers his coffee out to Dean and Dean takes it with a grateful noise. Sam’s whole face contorts in confusion, eyes flicking between them, but Dean studiously ignores him. He knows it probably makes a weird sight—Dean being all buddy-buddy with a guy whose guts he hated six hours ago. He doesn’t care. That’s like the only good thing about being on his own now. Dean doesn’t have to explain himself to anyone. Well…except sometimes Charlie.
by this Azazel guy?”
Cas smiles softly. “You’re welcome. Happy Birthday.”
“We used to be a crew,” Ellen tells Jack. “John was the hitter and Mary was a damn good thief. I was the Grifter. And Bobby here, could run a con in his sleep. He was always the brain behind our operation. We were the best of friends. Family in everything but blood.”
“You asked me to.”
“I’ve got some over here,” Jack says softly.
“Huh,” Dean shrugs. “That’s weird.”
“Do you have all of your meetings at restaurants now?” Sam asks.
“And I…think this was a mistake,” Kevin says. He shakes his head. “I should go.”
. That’s not the same as just asking you to carry me.”
Castiel likes to think that he knows Dean Winchester better than anyone else.
When he finally looks at Cas again, his expression has transformed into something awed and hopeful. "Dean, you didn't have to do that."
“I could…” Cas’ mouth twists and he looks away. “I could ask him to come if you’d be more comfortable with him.”

?” Dean repeats. “Can souls even
“I won’t have a problem putting aside our differences,” Cas says. There’s an
Cas leans in and presses a lingering kiss to Dean’s cheek. “I’m going to make sure none of the pots on the stove boil over. I’ve heard it’s a very important job.”
Sam ignores him. “You’re not going to try to steal this, are you?”
Cas eyes him. “A month ago, you thought I was a very big jerk.”
Cas ignores him. He drags Dean to the kitchen and takes a look around, trying to map out a strategy for the next few hours. The sink is empty and Jack and Sam are leaning against the counter in the midst of half made side dishes. Cas spots a stack of recipe cards that Dean has been waving around all morning and he flips through them quickly, frowning.
The guard nods a goodbye and wanders away, mind still caught on whoever the fuck Linetti is. With any luck, they’ll be long gone before his mind circles back to Dean and Jack.
He comes up triumphantly with his phone, but pauses when he sees a notification for a voicemail. It’s not from a number he recognizes, but when he listens to it, he sure as fuck recognizes the voice.
? You had to know he’d go a little crazy trying to make it perfect for you.”
“I’m in,” Jack says, practically vibrating with excitement. Ugh.
“Hm,” Dean hums. “You’d think if a guy that smart was going to cheat, he would make sure he
Sam can’t help the bitter laugh that bursts out of him.
That time Dean had taken him for a drive after that first big argument with Dad. Dad had been yelling at him, and for once in his life, Sam had yelled right back. Dean had been shouting at both of them, trying to shove them apart until he managed to shove Sam right out the door and into the Impala.  Dean had rolled down the windows and cranked up the music and they flew down the road until Sam felt like he could almost breathe again.
Sam has
Jack leans forward in his chair, curious gaze on Ellen. “So, if he’s their uncle…are you their aunt?” he asks. “Are you and Bobby married?”
Dean wiggles out of the zip ties, wincing as the plastic cuts into his hands. Baldy and his goons booked it out of here pretty fast when the “FBI” showed up, but they could be back any second. If they get back before Cas finds them, Dean wants to be ready to fight.
Charlie is hiding behind her computer screen, and Jack’s face is frozen in smile that doesn’t reach his eyes. It’s not hard to see why. Cas has this pinched look on his face, eyes narrowed as he snipes at Sam. And even though Dean can’t see Sam’s face, it’s clear from the set of his shoulders that he’s bitching right back. Kevin is looking like he regrets everything that’s led him to this moment. Another moment and they might spook away a job, and a kid who seems to genuinely need their help.
,” Cas spits.
“But I don’t—you said you spoke to someone on the phone about this?”
Dean covers his face with his hands. “Ugh. I need coffee.”
"Sorry," Dean says. "It's--my dad's calling. He's gonna be pissed."
As abruptly as Jack’s face had fallen, it lights up again. “Castiel! I was praying we would get to work together again!”
“I hate you,” he informs Cas, once he has his breath back. There’s raucous laughter in his earbud. “I hate
“Hey,” Dean says, around the sudden tightness in his throat. “Where’s Sam?”
, Sam thinks.
Cas ignores him.
Way more important things.
She’s smiling brightly at them both, a laptop covered with colorful stickers parked in front of her. She has a bright purple shirt on that proclaims her a
“Uh…yes?” Sam asks awkwardly. “Do you have a question, Jack?”
“So, what? Dad tried to steal this ledger and couldn’t? And now he’s on the run and wants you to grab it?”
Sam snorts and his shoulders relax some. “Yeah. I’m surprised you lasted as long as you did.”
“You know how to throw a punch?” Dean asks Jack.
And why Cas was trying to stop him? Trying to spare him from baring his soul in front of all of these people?
? You have bionic vision or something?”
Someone kicks at his foot under the table—probably Charlie. Jack and Cas are staring at Dean like he’s lost his mind.
, please? Did you find out anything new about Free Will Enterprises?”
"Hey, if it works, it works."
“You don’t seem like criminals.”
He straightens up and heads over to Dean apologetically. Dean takes hold of a random mop bucket, and starts towards the door. “You aren’t gonna freak out on me, are you?”
Ellen turns to Charlie. “Does that USB thingy mean you have access to their system now?”
He drags his eyes to the start of the entry. To the client’s name.
“Of course, I am. He's in trouble, Sam!”
different.
She clicks through all the channels, one after the other—and one after the other they spill the skeletons in their closets out at her feet.
“What? Of course not. What—did he say something to you?”
Jack smiles. “Don’t worry. I don’t freak out.”
Jack is flitting around, touching everything and using various synonyms for the word cool, but Castiel is just standing inside the door, like he’s a wind-up toy or something. Sam gives him a tentative smile. “You want to sit down? Get comfy?”
“So?” Dean snaps. “It’s not like we tell each other everything. You’re allowed to have a private life, dude.”
“We can’t find Chuck Shurley,” one of his agents tells him. “He must have jumped ship.”
. He’s sure there’s a joke in there somewhere. He’s also not convinced that he’s down with relying on a 90-pound teenager to get him out of here.
Jack worms his way into the hug too, and then it's just Cas--sitting on the outside and staring down at the table like it's the most interesting thing he's ever seen.

Cas had written. But Dean doesn’t. Not with the way he’s been acting.

Dean shakes his head, just a smidge too fast. “Nope.”

“So, how do you two know each other?” Baldy asks, like they’re friends chatting it up over lunch.

Sam laughs. "Maybe we can make our own life. We can make a difference. Figure it out together."
,” he says.
And now, Cas knows him even better. He didn’t think it was possible. He’s only been back from the empty for a few weeks, but now he knows the way Dean’s voice sounds like honey when it murmurs sweet things in his ear. He knows the awkward, pleased tilt of his mouth when Cas says something that makes him blush. The way Dean hid his face and groaned like he was dying while Cas clumsily jerked him off last night.
Ellen and Jack hand over their newly supplied fake IDs. The receptionist punches a few numbers in the phone. “Your eleven o’clock is here. Okay.” She stands up and leads them towards a bored guard who does a perfunctory search of their bags. Ellen holds her breath when Jack hands over his "camera bag", but she needn't have worried. They're waved through and they follow the receptionist to the elevators. She swipes her card and presses the button for the top floor. “They’re expecting you.”
"Yeah," Dean says. "You wouldn't be the first guy."
Sam hangs up and closes the door, clicking the lock back into place. He pauses there with his back to Dean, like it’s easier to look at a door than at his brother. Classic.
Bobby hasn’t played the part of scowly FBI agent in a long time, but it’s like riding a bike. He’s glaring at everyone as he strides up to the front of the building, Sam and Cas not far behind him. Bobby’s done the intimidation act on his own, but there’s something to be said for having two guys as backup. Especially a guy as strong as Castiel and a guy as tall as Sam. They’re all in bright blue FBI windbreakers and it draws eyes to them like magnets. Bobby can hear the whispers start flying before they’re even in the building.
He looks at Cas desperately. Cas rolls his eyes, but thankfully takes pity on him. “Yes,” he says, resting a hand on Dean’s shoulder. “Don’t worry. I’ll fight them off.”
“Mine too,” Charlie says, resting her head on Jack’s shoulder.
“Is he okay?”
“Guess we should sketch out a plan, then?”
“Who is MacGyver?” Castiel asks, to Dean’s utter horror. “I’ve never worked with him.”
Chuck stands, seemingly grateful for an excuse to end this interview he didn’t know he was having. “Well—uh—Trisha—"
“Damn,” Charlie whispers to herself. “I’m good.”
Charlie
Sam sits up a little straighter, and pulls out the stupid legal pad he’s been writing on all day. Somehow a plan has emerged from the scribbles and scratch-outs and doodles. “We need to steal a ledger.”
“Yeah. Got it in their fool heads that they could do a job, just the two of them. They made it out, but not without leaving a bunch of tracks. Azazel decided he wanted revenge.”
“Thanks,” he tells her.
His normal line of defense against a security alarm is to already know the code. Or to have Charlie work some nerdy magic. Dean could guess at a few different codes here, but the suspicious creak of a bedroom door across the room lets him know he doesn’t have time. So much for the element of surprise. He curses and stands up, hands raised and a sheepish smile curling on his face.
The way he says it, wryly—like it’s something he’s never experienced—makes Dean huff out a humorless laugh. “Maybe. Doesn’t sound like my dad.”
Could it be that easy? He thinks about it all the way to the burger joint. Thinks about it as they’re walking inside and he unconsciously holds the door for Cas. Cas sends him a quick, appreciative smile, eyes crinkling at the corners.
by Toto at the top of his lungs.
doing here?” Dean asks her.
Dean’s not a hitter, not normally. Fighting isn’t his thing, but that doesn’t mean he can’t do it.
Charlie and Jack exchange an uncomfortable look. Dean frowns at Sam. He’s been doing this more and more often lately. Sending these barbed remarks Cas’ way, like he’s expecting Cas to say:
Entitled. Smug.
The door swings open to reveal three incredulous guards and a bloody, grinning Dean behind them.
Charlie shrugs. “Don’t ask me. He’s
Victor cocks his head. “Let me get this straight. Your story is that thieves stole this ledger, and then returned to the scene of the crime, beat you up, and planted the ledger on your body. And then they disappeared without being seen by any FBI agents?”
believes me. All because the principal’s son said I cheated. I did everything right and I
Charlie perks up under the praise, but Sam isn’t swayed. “You know what else Dad didn’t have? He didn’t have a crew. And neither do you guys. Charlie’s a hacker and you’re a grifter and I’m…whatever I am. But a job like this needs a full crew. We need a thief and we need a hitter. There’s no way this works with just the three of us. If we’re going to do this, we’re going to do this right.”
Charlie suddenly says, breathless. Dean pauses, card poised to try another swipe. “
“Why did you break into our building?”
The one thing
“Uh, no. Definitely not. They don’t let the interns do that.”
“Why did they hire you?” Baldy asks, sounding impatient. “What did they want?”
Mom. We can’t just let him get away with that.”
Dean’s phone chimes with a text and he fumbles his phone up, convinced it’s going to be Dad.
“Yes,” Cas says wryly. “He looks very intimidating.”
Charlie and Jack had simply shrugged and Cas had said, “Anywhere but Illinois,” and then refused to elaborate any more. Sam had abandoned that discussion with a huff, which means they’ve been playing Musical Motel Rooms in every city they stop in.
. Castiel’s eyes flick back and forth between Dean and Sam for a moment before he finishes: “451 means arson. Though it was probably made to look like an accidental fire.”
“I know you took the ledger,” Baldy snaps, suddenly losing whatever tenuous patience he’d possessed. “Listen here you little worms—”
“Thanks,” Dean says. Most of the time he’s almost afraid to look at Cas, but today his eyes are drawn to him helplessly. He’s in sweats and an old band t-shirt of Dean’s because he sleeps now. There’s still the ghost of a bruise on his cheek because he can’t heal anymore. “And thanks for the coffee, Cas.”
“You just said there were no rules to friendship.”
“Shut up,” Sam mutters. He takes in his surroundings for the first time. Woah. “You and Charlie are staying
“Well. She was right.” Sam searches for something to say. “I’ve been interning at this law office. Sandover and Sons. If things go well, I might have a job lined up before I graduate.”
Dean frowns. That’s not exactly a ringing endorsement. Sure, Jack
“What about you two? We could use some help from the Old Guard.”
. Other people ignore Dean's calls, but Dean always answers. When's the last time he ignored a call from his dad?
Jack and Dean burst out of the staff exit—Jack almost tripping on the uneven pathway. Dean grabs him by the arm and yanks him upright as they careen towards the parking lot. Charlie’s yellow van is idling in wait, the back doors hanging open. Dean and Jack jump in, panting for breath.
Sam frowns at him across the room. “How
Dean rereads the words, aware that the feeling he woke up with is growing stronger. Almost painful. This ain’t his half-healed ribs. This is his heart, beating against the bars of its cage, begging for him to listen to it.
Perhaps sensing the emotions in the room, Castiel is a little bit hesitant to answer this time. “MW was killed in Kansas on November 2nd,” he starts. The date makes Sam’s heart clench.
Dean blinks at him, surprised to see a sort of steely resolve in Sam’s eyes. “What? What are you talking about?”
All Dean wants to do is slip into the warm embrace of the coffee shop. Instead, he tries to peer through the window without looking too obvious about it, stamping his feet on the ground to try and warm up his legs.
Right now, he’s erring on the side of love—mostly because of how good the bartender’s taking care of him. Dean’s been wallowing away his sorrows with a bottle of Jack and is on his way to well and truly numb—just the way he likes it.
Dean holds up his hand before Cas, looking extremely disturbed, can respond. "So let me get this straight: We fucked over the people who killed mom
“Yeah. Dean’s had me tracking that for days. So far, there’s been nothing.”
listening,” Sam assures him. “We’re here to help you.”
“I know. But I thought…” Sam seems flustered. “I don’t know. I thought we could come up with a new plan together.”
careful.”
“No,” Sam snaps. “Jesus Christ, Dean. Did you learn nothing from Dad?”
“So,” Sam turns to Castiel now. “How do you and Dean know each other?”
. How many times do I have to say it?”
Dean’s laugh is contagious and soon Jack and Sam are laughing too. Castiel’s face, at first indignant, slowly melts into a grudging smile of his own.
It’s an old book. Full up with handwritten names and dates. It goes back to the seventies. “Jesus. How long have these guys been operating?”
“You had this planned,” he realizes suddenly. “Why didn’t anyone tell me?”
The bartender flips the channel to a sports game, unaware of the seven eyes and ears that are gleefully watching the newscast. Dean turns to face their table—broad smile threatening to take over his face. He raises his glass. “Well how about that for a job well done? Huh? You guys hear that?”
Ostensibly, he’s the man who paid to kill their mother, but the name means nothing to Sam.  He was too young; doesn’t remember enough to be any real help. And with Dad out of pocket, there’s only one other person Sam can think of that might know.
Dean follows his gaze to Kyle Newport. “You know he’s just a teenager, right?” he asks. “Teenagers make bad decisions. They’re practically required to.”
“I am
Jack steels himself and marches across the hallways to a door that’s shut tight, sneakers squeaking on the tile floor. He knocks on the door. “Open up!” he shouts. “You have my friend in there.”
“I’m fine.”
“This feels too easy,” Dean says nervously.
Sam winces. “Sorry,” he says, scooping up the phone and handing it back to the kid.
By the time they pull into the garage, Dean has waffled back and forth so many times that he’s lost track of the argument he was having with himself. He just wants.
Dean scowls through the first ten minutes of their drive, Cas trying and failing to hide the amused smile on his face.
Dean crosses his arms and leans back in his chair. “You’re telling me that John Winchester risked his neck for a list of names? Why?”
"Yeah," Dean sighs. "I know what you mean." It's tough to reconcile the image of the Mary he keeps in his head--someone who wore sundresses and had impeccable hair and baked pies all day--with the truth of who she really was. His vision seems so stupidly Stepford wife now. "I think we probably would've been a
problem."
He eyes Dean out of the corner of his eye as he sits, staring at his phone until the buzzing stops and the screen goes black.
“Oh,” Dean says—heart in his throat; soul howling. “Okay.”
“Got it—"
Dean rubs a hand over his face, the warmth in his gut turning a little sour. For a minute he’d been enjoying talking to Cas. Dude was probably right. If they’d met each other for the first time on this job, things would have been different. Dean’s eyes catch on Castiel’s fingers—long and strong and loosely clasped around his glass. Yeah. Things probably would’ve been
“What is it?” Cas seems distracted, still looking at his phone. The burst of annoyance makes Dean even more determined to do it. To finally say it. To be happy.
“Where the hell’d you get that?” he barks.
—” Cas hisses, grabbing for Sam’s arm fruitlessly. Sam dodges his hand and slips past Dean.
Cas, then.
John’s built for smash and grabs. Quick jobs at an art gallery or a mansion. Security companies have cameras and guards and safes. Those kinds of jobs require
“If you
, Dean,” Cas sighs. “And I don’t care about cranberry sauce.”
Dean hates guys like this.
“You’re talking about the ledger that holds proof of Free Will’s role in hundreds, if not thousands, of deaths across the country? That ledger?”
. I don't know how to describe it.”
Dean rocks on his heels, doing some quick calculations. It’s technically Saturday, even though the sun’s not up yet. That gives him, what, a day and a half with his brother? A day and a half to steal this ledger. It’s cutting it close, but he’d have to be an idiot to pass that up. “Okay. Sure. I can swing that. Sunday.” He grins. “We probably won’t even have to break any laws.”
fault he turned into such a good con man. Dad used to leave him and Sam alone so often, that Dean
“My partner,” Dean reminds him. “The hacker. You’ll like her; she’s awesome.”
Dean could pick a lock in his sleep, so he makes quick work of the shitty apartment door. His fingers deftly maneuver the picks in the dark until the door clicks open, but the alarm that starts insistently beeping makes him freeze.
Dean, absurdly, seems surprised by this. He laughs. “Sorry, man. I can’t picture it. What were you like? A loner? Or maybe one of those marching band geeks—?”
“Well,” Bobby interrupts, clapping his hands on his thighs. “I hate to break this party up, but I've got a plane to catch. You boys did a good thing today. I'm proud of you.”
“No way,” Dean suddenly says. His face is going all pale and milky. “No
, the thing inside him whispers.
“Alright, I know you have—” he pauses, hissing. “Castiel?”
They follow the hostess to a table tucked away in a secluded little corner. Charlie’s chatting with someone across the table who has his back to Dean.
Kevin slowly sinks back down in his chair, eyeing them all in confusion. “I can’t pay you.”
“Apple pie for the birthday boy,” the waitress chirps, setting a plate down in front of him. Cas looks like he’s torn between thanking her and yelling at her.
“I’m her cameraman,” Jack announces woodenly.
“He called?”
“Oh great,” Dean mutters. “Two MacGyvers. I’m working with two MacGyvers.”
Castiel holds it out to him wordlessly. “Yeah.”
you. C’mon, Cas. I know your secret now.”
Dean's blushing so hard. He can feel his whole face turning red. He thinks Garth is crying into the salsa now.
“Deal.”
He sweeps forward and catches the guard’s hand as he brings the gun up, forcing it up towards the ceiling. Dean ushers Jack ahead of him, back toward the staff entrance. “Go, go—”
He's waited 42 years for this.
“And you just
“Look, he…he’s in trouble. He was casing a joint last time I talked to him. Some big security company in Jericho. Hadn’t heard from him in a few days, but then he sent me instructions for a job. Said it’s life or death.”
“Who’s Charlie?” Sam asks immediately.
“Jeez, I thought college was supposed to make you smart. You’re the one who said Dad’s plan sucked.”
in front of a client. For now, he passes Cas a cup of coffee, offers a croissant to Kevin, and sits back as Charlie starts telling them everything she’s found out about Kyle Newport.
Dean grabs Cas’ shoulder, trying to bring him back to the present. There’s a story here, but they don’t have time to listen to it. “No. But we can’t lose sight of the bigger picture.”
Dean chews on his lip for a minute, thinking. He doesn’t want to have John Winchester’s life. Doesn’t want to be the lonely bastard that drinks alone. Dean has exactly one friend. He can’t afford to turn any potential ones away.
Murder.
“Jack!” Charlie says, perking up. “Thanks for coming!”
Cas freezing up.
Cas punches him once and he slumps back to the floor, unconscious.
Sam purses his lips, but doesn’t say anything else. He’s not prepared to

He’s met with solemn nods.
His hand clenches around his glass.
about this—but Dean’s phone starts blaring and he winces, digging it out of his pocket.
Charlie sobers slightly, tapping quickly on the keys of her computer. “Yeah. Okay. I did find something. You guys are probably not gonna like it.”
Castiel’s grin seamlessly morphs into a glare. Dean ignores it.
“Alright,” he sighs. “Let’s see what’s inside.”
is why Cas was on his phone all day. And why Sam didn’t come with them to lunch.
Mr. Shurley is staring at Ellen in utter confusion. She gives him a sunny smile back.

“Hi,” she says. “I’m Charlie. You’re taller than Dean made you seem.”
Cas has never respected Grifters much. Has never liked how they lie and scheme and cheat their way to their goal. But Dean is different. Dean is a Grifter, but he still puts stock in things like promises.
The barista’s eyes go wide. “Wow.

. You’ll get to know him again. Assuming you keep in touch after you go back to Palo Alto this time.”
“Why didn’t Dad ever tell us?” Sam asks, echoing Dean’s thoughts from last night.
Sam stumbles out of the passenger seat, taking sweet, blessed breaths of fresh air. In the car, Charlie’s squawking: “What do you
Sam stares at Dean, unsettled. Dean had always seemed excited to settle in to a new motel room—to test out the water pressure and search through the drawers for forgotten items. Too late, Sam realizes that was probably for his benefit. That Dean was trying to make it seem fun for his little brother, even when it was royally fucked up.
The camera bag that Jack carried into the building is open. The video camera is discarded, but he keeps pulling more and more cables and harnesses out of hidden pockets.
“What the hell,” Bobby mutters, his eyes looking suspiciously bright under his hat. “You’re gonna need someone there to make sure you don’t royally screw the pooch.”
A muffled grunt and the sounds of punches hitting filter through the comms.
“No,” Jack says. He’s still smiling. Doesn’t his face get tired of that?
“Wait—
Dean grins. “Music to my ears, Cas.”
“Dean, go,” he snaps, eyes flashing in annoyance. “I’ve got this.”
Charlie’s whole face lights up and she holds out a fist for Sam to bump. Dean rolls his eyes and groans good-naturedly into his coffee. “Great. Now there’s two of them. Can we

good at blending. He’s been wandering around the sixth floor for seven minutes before a hand finally clamps onto his arm.
“Oh yeah,” Ellen said. “Pretty sure it was your secretary. She called me and scheduled me in for today.”
“Hey!” Dean yells, bucking and wiggling under the guards that come forward to search him. There’s no way he’s making this easy. “Get off me! I have constitutional rights, you know!”
,” Sam says dryly. “We might as well be.”
to pick the same bar I was at?”
Dean bares his teeth at him in a facsimile of a smile. “No thanks to you.”
Dean ignores them, though the back of his neck is flushed red. “I like the bubbles,” he mutters.
Dean’s eyes widen. It seems impossibly fast. It’s barely been a minute.
Jack raises his hand. Jesus Christ.
“Great,” Cas says briskly. “But we have a lot of work to do.”
Ellen and Jack climb out of the van and stroll down the street. As they walk, Charlie’s typing furiously. She creates a press release, embeds a few email chains, and rearranges some meetings on the boss’s schedule all before they step foot into the lobby.
Sam snatches the napkin out of Dean’s hands. “What? What the hell does this mean?”
“How is your father, Dean?”
Embezzling from clients.
Castiel abruptly releases Dean’s foot, breaking their eye contact. Dean sits back in his chair, breathing heavily. “Sorry,” he grits out, refusing to meet anyone’s eyes. He’s fine. Or he
Ellen tilts her head, consideringly. “The Old Guard, huh? Sure. It’ll be like a last hurrah.”
Prepping for a job is second nature at this point. Dean leaves Charlie to work her magic and try to find them some backup that’s close enough to pinch hit. He hopes whoever she finds knows what the hell they’re doing. The last thing they need is a someone who’s never worked a job messing everything up.
Dean hissed.
“Our definitions of fun are not the same.”
Dean won’t look at him. But Sam knows what he’s thinking. And it’s not possible. It’s not—

“Cas,” Dean says. “

“It would appear so. I guess you could call it fate.”
been a bad boy, haven’t you? What’s on the drive?”
“Your mom was made for the life,” Ellen says, a sad smile on her face. “She missed doing jobs when she was pregnant. Missed the rush she got from it. She wasn’t made to stay at home and be June Cleaver.”
“You believe this assassins for hire crap?” Sam asked incredulously. “Dean, this guy Dad was talking to sounds like a nut job!”
“Oh,” Dean’s voice is a little higher than he would like. Great. So Cas just swung him up over his shoulders and carried him back 4 blocks. Wow. Awesome. Why does Dean have to get so messy when he’s drunk?
“Why not? Public places hold everyone accountable. Plus, everyone likes good food.” Dean has too many memories of tagging along with John to smoky back rooms in bars—angry men that were ready to fight at the slightest provocation. Dean likes his way better. He ups his pace, struggling to keep up with Sam’s stupidly long stride. “Jesus, will you slow down, Sammy?”
“Alright, Dean,” he says. “You’re up first.”
“Okay, okay! We’re leaving.”
“Good,” Cas finally says. “That’s good.”
“Oh,” Jack says. Absurdly, he looks crestfallen. “That’s okay. I understand.”
Cas cuts him off with a hard kiss, fingers twisted in Dean's flannel shirt. Someone that sounds suspiciously like Jack cheers and Garth breaks down into another round of sobs. Dean ignores them all and wraps his arms around Cas, gentling the kiss to something soft and tender.
There’s another moment of silence; broken only by Charlie nervously tapping her fingers on the table.
He heads over to the bar, feeling lighter than he has in years. He almost can't believe it. He has his brother back with him, they're doing something meaningful. And he has a crew. Full of
He stalks out of the room and slams the door behind him.
“Don’t answer him,” Dean mutters, because it looks like Jack is about to. His jaw is throbbing and there’s a blood trickling down his face from somewhere above his eye.
“No,” Dean mutters mutinously.
“Then this is
“I don’t know,” Dean mutters. He sinks down on Sam’s couch, rubbing a tired hand through his hair. “He doesn’t exactly tell me much. Won’t answer my calls. Just told me it was life or death and rattled off those instructions. He’s lucky I had a pen handy. The whole phone call lasted maybe a minute.”
of fake eggs and maple syrup is making him nauseous again—and collapses in the seat next to Cas.
Bobby snorts, looking all too amused with himself.
“Dean and Sam are very good at their jobs,” Cas puts in earnestly—the first words he’s spoken since Dean interrupted whatever was going on between him and Sam. He makes a mental note to figure out what the hell that was about later—when they’re

“I did not!” he spits immediately, face going crimson.
Baldy sighs. “What? What is it? What could
“Yes!” Adler says.
Charlie is the first one to recover from Castiel’s bombshell.
Cas has killed people. He knows how to use his fists to inflict maximum damage with minimal effort. He has definitely hurt more people than he’s helped. But…Dean is still smiling at him. Dean thinks he’s a good person.

to get him back. Not just because some dickhead writer decided it would make the most interesting storyline.
Dean swallows nervously. “Yeah, yeah, me too, yep,” he babbles. He tries to throw back his drink only to find it’s already empty again. He stares at it, betrayed.
did it. I can’t believe it.”
Dean’s face shifts into a stubborn glare and he hunches down in his seat, tapping out a message to Charlie. “I don’t need glasses,” he mumbles. “
A black man with a thunderous look on his face strides over to them. “What the hell are you doing here? This is
“Who hired you?”
Behind them, Cas pushes the guard back, slamming him into the wall. He bangs his wrist against the wall once, twice, three times—until the guard grunts in pain and the gun tumbles to the floor. Dean winces, half expecting the commotion to attract another guard. He swipes one of the stolen key cards and Jack darts into the locker room. Cas kicks the gun away without looking, effortlessly twisting the guard around into a chokehold. The guard gasps for air, fingers scrabbling at Cas’ sleeve. Castiel’s eyes catch on Dean, hovering at the door and watching nervously.
the shit-eating grin on his face. "You guys want us to give you a minute alone, or...?"
"Good. Good." Dean tries to flag down the bartender and fails to get his attention. "I'm happy you're--oh, sorry--" His pocket starts to vibrate. He catches sight of the number, and every ounce of good feeling leaks out of him. Like he's a balloon that was savagely popped.
have favors I can call in. Leave it to me.”
Kevin stills suddenly, narrowing his eyes at Dean. “You played me, didn’t you?”
Cas doesn’t give any response. It’s like he’s decided to deal with Dean by turning into a statue and pretending he doesn’t exist. Whatever. Dean can work with that. It’s better than actually having to
Cas is quiet for a moment.
Dean turns to see every locker on the opposite wall hanging open. He gapes at Jack. “What the—how the hell’d you do that so fast?”
He stares down at the man the sign was left on. His name is Zachariah Adler. Victor recognizes him from case files he could never close. As far as he’s concerned, whoever wrote this sign did him a favor. They tied Adler up like a little present for the FBI Agent lucky enough to stumble across him. Damn, it really is his lucky day.
He feels Sam’s eyes on him as the line rings and rings, and forces his face to remain steady when it goes to voicemail. He knew it.
“Really?” Dean asks as Cas binds up Zachariah’s hands.
By the time the elevator reaches the top floor, she’s the only one in it. A secretary gestures at the black leather armchairs lining the walls, barely looking up. “Please take a seat. Mr. Shurley will be with you in a moment.”
Dean rolls his eyes, but there’s a grateful smile on his face and his shoulders are a little bit straighter. He grabs Charlie’s empty coffee cup and pushes away from the table to refill it at the counter. For the first time, Sam realizes that Dean and Charlie aren’t just partners. They’re
“Yeah,” Dean shouts through the door, doing his best to sound calm. “Cleaning crew!”
“We made it, bitches!” Charlie whoops from the driver’s seat.
“I don’t like guns,” Cas answers.
Sam frowns.
“Alright,” he finally says. “What is it?”
He’s never subscribed to the idea that a day could make much difference. Your birthday is no different from the day before it. You still have to deal with all the shit life throws at you. Just because you’re officially older doesn’t mean you’re wiser or more well-adjusted or more equipped to handle it.
He ignores the coffee in favor of the note, plucking it up delicately and unfolding it the way one might defuse a bomb.
Dean gapes at him. “What—
Cas nods, looking wretched. "I'm so sorry, Dean," he whispers in a rush, as Sam starts to jog over. "I would never ask you not to--I just didn't want you to regret saying anything in front of all these people--"
Like it was
“Dean,” Charlie says. “You’re freaking us out.”
“This is my favorite job I’ve ever done,” Jack sighs happily.
Ugh,” Sam groans. “I
“Oh, I also have this—” Jack pulls something out of his waistband. Dean does a double take. It’s a 9mm Glock by the looks of it, and Jack is just turning it over in his hands, peering at it curiously.

Dean’s not a thief and he’s not a hacker. He wasn’t prepared for an

“Wondered what?”

His door is closed again, but someone must have opened it for Miracle, because he knows she went to sleep on Sam’s bed last night like a

Charlie screeches to a halt in a hotel parking lot. Sam doesn’t even question where they are, too intent on not puking from the (frankly terrifying) way Charlie had been taking corners.
Castiel gives him a side-long glance, like he doesn’t know how much he should say.
Claire's actually looking a little guilty for calling him out, even though she shouldn't. Dean feels great. A little weak with relief, but lighter than he has in
Sam huffs. “
Dean gives a short nod and changes the subject to another, equally unpleasant one. “Speaking of complicated, what the hell’s going on between you and Sam?”
. He can play it off, like always.
He slams the glass down and marches over to Cas, only a little bit more unsteady than he thought he would be. “What the hell are you doing here?”
“I didn’t cheat!” Keven yells, slamming his book back down on the table.
“Hm.” Victor bends down and picks up a worn brown book that had been tucked under Adler’s prone body. He flips through it. “Is it
Cas cocks his head, eyes staring at Dean like he used to. Like he’s trying to see into him. “Because you’re another year older?”
“Hello!” a voice chirps behind them. Dean tears his glare away from Cas, spinning to find the human equivalent of a puppy. Seriously: floppy hair, eager smile, wide eyes—the whole nine yards.
“Whatever.” Charlie knows some
“Yellow.”
“Aw, come on, Bobby,” another voice says from behind him. “Thought you were gonna go easy on him.”
“What?” he snaps through the glass.
The bartender sways back over to him. She’s got a swirling tattoo on her arm and short dark hair. She sets another round in front of him. “Got yourself an admirer,” she says, motioning over to the other end of the bar.
Sam’s never known how to handle Dean when he gets all self-deprecating like that. But Charlie doesn’t bat an eye.
They head as fast as possible down the hallway to the elevator bay. It feels like it takes forever for the elevator to show up, and then another eternity to take them down to the ground floor. When the elevator doors open, Dean’s heart drops. They’re face to face with another guard. The guard’s hand immediately goes for his gun, but Cas is faster.
“We’ll track him down eventually.” Can’t catch all the chickens in one day. “In the meantime, let’s read Adler his rights.”
“And did you find that information?”
“Cas, wait up,” he says. “I need to tell you something.”
“My dad,” Dean mutters shortly. “He’s such an asshole sometimes.”

look, but she’s bouncing her way back to the table, more intent on her plate of food than on Dean and Cas. Dean lets himself relax a little more.
Almost.
He gulps. “In theory.”
“I don’t know,” Dean shakes his head. “I don’t know. Fuck, I need some air.”
“A private security company. Free Will Enterprises.”
It’s hard to remember that it wasn’t all just screaming matches and silent treatments. The last few years, before he left—yeah, those were bad. But even in that time, there were nice moments. That time Dean let him borrow the car to take Lindsey out on a date in senior year. The time in Texas, when they found a snake curled up on the back floorboard and Dean had screamed so loud, Sam cried from laughing.

“Son of a

Everyone turns to Cas, mouths agape. Sam lets the ledger sag in his hands, eyeing Cas warily. “What?”
Dean offers him a bloody smile. “Heya, Sammy. Long time no see.”
Dean blinks at him. “No?”
Cas glares at him. “Don’t pretend like your job was as bad as mine.”
Dean smiles to himself.
“Sure,” Sam snorts. “That’s why you showed up in the middle of the night and didn’t bother to knock.”
there. That Dean can’t be professional. It makes him bristle.

Dean drives home with one eye on the road and one eye on Cas. He’s texting someone again and Dean is tapping his fingers on the steering wheel.
“Dismantling a murderous, criminal organization seems inherently more important than chasing down one man for revenge,” Cas says.
Baldy sighs. “I don’t believe you. Search him.”
The smile he’s trying to bite back suggests otherwise.

“Yeah,” Sam laughs. “Point made. Seriously. I’m sorry I doubted you.”
“Good enough for me.”
“So I’m dead either way?” Dean pretends to think. “Something about that doesn’t seem fair.”
“Don’t ask me to wait,” Dean begs. “I didn’t ask

Charlie snorts. “He’s still

Suddenly he’s pushed forward several feet as the door is shouldered open behind him. Dean is standing in the hallway, looking back and forth between Cas and Sam like he’s been betrayed. “Well,” he says, and that’s his fake-happy smile, Cas would know it from a mile away. “Isn’t this cozy?”
Charlie stares at him in horror. “You

Sam stares at him. "It can't be that simple. You'd be fine with me just
He only feels a little bad about lying.
Castiel looks exasperated. “There are real FBI agents in the building now. This is the only way out of the building without being seen.”
Cas takes his place at the stove and catches Dean’s eye from across the room, his heart full. This, here, all of them together and talking over one another and bickering—this is
Dean might have learned how to get what he wanted without using his fists, but his dad is another story. John Winchester was—

He swings around to stare at her—moaning when he moves too fast and head throbs painfully.
Cas hums. “Mine either.”
Dean has a lot of rules for friendship, and he always seems to be adding more. He started off with one rule:

The warmth of the coffee shop is a relief, and Dean inhales the smell of freshly baked pastries and coffee beans greedily as they enter. While the others dutifully follow Sam over to meet Kevin, Dean slips away to order some snacks. They all need it.
“What the hell, Cas?” Dean asks, crossing his arms and barely even looking at Sam as he bails. “The cranberry sauce almost burned because you ditched me.”

Charlie frowns.
“Yeah. The best.”
“I know that, Dean. Better than most.”
“Oh? You
“Everyone’s clear on the plan?” Sam asks.
Dean pauses. “I think you should tell him that yourself.”
Dean’s sweating. His legs are shaking. He peers over the edge and yanks himself back, hand twisting tightly into Castiel’s windbreaker. “Not. Happening.”
“You said you would help,” Dean snaps, voice low. “Why are you even here if you don’t want to help Dad?”
Dean snatches his wallet and keys. All that’s left is his phone. He searches around, a little distracted this time. “So, what. We talking like piggyback ride or—?”

need luck. This might be the easiest job he’s ever had.
“Yep. It’s under Bradbury,” Dean says, though he doesn’t know why Charlie even bothers. Dean always likes the challenge of talking his way into a table. A sleepy little place like this? It would’ve been a cakewalk.
"Sure you can," Dean says. "I hate to break it to you, Sam, but I wasn't exactly using my own money. If you don't want to go back, then don't. Don't torture yourself on my account."
It was there every time John left them in a motel room. It was there when he got to Stanford and was really, actually alone for the first time in his life. And it’s here now—now that his mom might have been murdered.
“No,” Sam says, like he just can’t help it. “I’m supposed to go back to Palo Alto today.”
Look at that. The kid
“It’s fine,” Dean grumbles. It makes him look adorably put out. “It’s not a big deal. I could probably stand to relax a little bit. It’s just. For the first time, I have hope, you know? I have you. Sam and Eileen are here. Chuck is gone. Jack is alive and doing good things. I just wanted one day. One day where we have everyone together, so if things go sideways in the future I can look back and remember how nice it was. But. Turns out Thanksgiving meals are kind of hard to pull off alone. Sorry.”
Dean frowns. “Maybe one day, kid.”
It’s an unfamiliar thing, and Dean turns to him in amazement, eyes catching on the way his nose wrinkles up.
“Dean—”
He's not waiting for a minute alone. He's not waiting anymore.
“Cas, not you too,” Sam moans. He shoots a glare at Dean, like it's his fault the guy has a sense of humor.
Dean stares at the plate in front of him in confusion, before sending a half-hearted glare Cas’ way.
. Has it really been that long since he’s talked to his brother?  A little bit of guilt pokes at him, but he shoves it away. He’s been busy. Busy taking the LSAT and getting into law school. Busy finding an internship that he would be able to juggle while studying. “No,” Sam finally says. “We, uh. We broke up a while ago.”
He looks so serious as he says it. Dean can’t help the snort that erupts out of him. It feels nice to feel something that isn’t anger or sadness or numbness. “Yeah, fuck all the assbutts,” he leers, grin turning into something genuine when an embarrassed flush appears on Castiel’s cheeks.
“You sure?”
. Shut up. You want to tell us how you know so much about Free Will Enterprises?”
As one, they all turn to peer through the window again. Kevin Tran, is slumped at a table, reading a book while he waits for their meeting. He’s in jeans and a blazer that’s a little too big for him. He has a bowtie.
“Not a problem,” Sam says, without missing a beat.
It’s the closest they’ve ever gotten to acknowledging the fucking huge elephant in the room. Cas is looking out of the corner of his eye at him, like he's not sure Dean wants to spend time with him anymore. It makes Dean feel sick. It's only been a week since Cas has been back, and Dean has spent the whole time existing in a haze of disbelief and quiet panic. He'd been so obsessed with actually getting Cas back, that he never stopped to prepare himself for what it would be like once they did.
Victor rolls his eyes. “Get him out of here, guys.” They drag Adler out of the room, still screaming nonsense.
Dean makes a face. “Oh, come on. You think I liked those shitty motel rooms we were always stuck in? I still have PTSD from that place that had the bed bugs.”
Sam rears back, eyes getting all squinty and confused. “Huh?
“Okay then.” Dean turns to slaps the counter, letting the good feelings chase away the bad. “Bartender! Another round for me and my friend here!”
“What the hell are

"Maybe you should ignore it," Cas says.
“You think we can leave yet?” Dean sighs, when he’s finished with his text. “This place is giving me the heebie jeebies.”
“And just where do you think you’re going?” a voice sneers.
that it will become an issue, then you need to tell us.
routine is not the way to go about this. “Good luck with getting your scholarship back.”
“Oh,” Dean taps his fingers some more. “Guess I missed the memo.”
He hangs up, helpless anger coursing through his body. He feels so useless, sitting next to a brother who doesn’t want to be there and trying to get in touch with a dad who doesn’t want to talk to him.
ledger?”
"Dean!" Charlie calls, waving him back towards the table. "We have an idea for our next job!"
“It’s supposed to be a good school. Kevin must be very smart to have gotten in with a scholarship.”
Cas huffs out a breath. Eyes staring angrily down at Zachariah. He looks away for a moment, jaw working, before he finally asks: “Do you have any of those zip ties?”
, he promises.
“Of course,” he says, wonderingly.
“Well. Judging by the voicemails he leaves me, he’s pretty pissed,” Dean says tightly, suddenly looking like the front gate is the most interesting thing he’s seen all day. “Haven’t actually spoken to him since we handed over that ledger to the FBI.”
But Kevin pauses in the act of standing up, his book clutched in front of his chest like a shield. “How did you know I lost my scholarship?”
? Why would Dad throw away our family for a quick score?”
“Shut up,” one of them growls. His hand goes to Dean’s pocket and he feels around, eyes flashing up to Dean’s. “What’s that?”
“My mistake.”
"I thought you might want some help carrying all the drinks back to the table," he says.
“Dean, wait—” Cas interrupts, eyes widening in understanding. He looks behind him into the bunker, like he’s looking for a way out
“Goddammit,” Dean chokes out, burying his face in his hands. “God

Cas shifts uncomfortably. “Sam thinks I’m hiding something.” Dean’s eyes blow wide in surprise. “I wondered if you thought the same.”
“Is it?” Cas shrugs. He doesn’t seem to care.
"I think I liked it better when they weren't friends," Charlie confides to Sam in an undertone, though Dean can tell by her grin that she's joking.
“No.” Cas considers lying, but the truth falls out of his mouth. “I was a lot like
“Really? You get to cross-examine anyone yet? Catch them in a lie?”
“You can tell me,” Dean snorts. “I’m not gonna fall apart.”
“I’m 42,” Dean scoffs. “Of course, I’m sure.” He jerks his head at Cas. “Come on.”
“Fuck,” Dean mutters. “

"Actually, yeah," Dean says. Cas' eyes widen in his peripherals. "
“Dean!” Charlie snaps, annoyed.
“Kyle,” Kevin answers. “Kyle Newport.”
“Where’s Castiel?” Sam asks worriedly, peering out of the back of the van.
"I liked making the bad guys pay too," Jack admits.
Cas stares at it like it might explode. “What are you doing?”
Sam has never been so happy to see Federal agents.
. A list of names.
“Then why didn’t Dad do it? It was his job, Dean! Not yours.”
He buries one of his hands in Miracle’s fur, sucking in a too sharp breath. He feels like he’s shaking apart, but she just blinks up at him calmly. Having her steady presence here is grounding a little bit. Enough that he can relax his grip after a moment or two. He goes back to petting her. He doesn’t know whether it’s more soothing for her or for him.
He nods in agreement and Sam starts scribbling notes, muttering to himself.
“Package ready for pick-up,” Jack whispers. “Can I go?”
“Maybe I figured you wouldn’t answer the door.” Dean lets his voice turn sharp with bitterness. “I wasn’t calling just to call, Sam. I need your help.”
Sam scrambles to pull a yellow legal pad out of his bag and flips to a fresh sheet. “I’ll need to see schematics,” he’s muttering, already pulling at his hair. “We should do this at night if we’re gonna go in and steal something physical. Less people around. Maybe tomorrow night?”
. Who puts a safe inside another safe?”
. I can’t just take off for a week.”
Castiel turns in his seat to greet them. Sam’s already heading forward, hand outstretched, but Dean isn’t about to act civil. His jaw is clenched, arms crossed in front of him. He’s sure he’s glaring if the increasingly alarmed look on Charlie’s face is any indication.
The lobby feels menacing and cold. Maybe Cas had a point being worried about breaking in here. The furniture is a combination of metal and black leather; dark walls branch off into shadowy hallways where assassins for hire probably lurk. “Charlie,” Dean murmurs, no louder than a breath. “Where am I going?”
"You don't need to say anything," Cas assures him immediately.
“Sure do.” Dean twists the conversation just a little bit. “You catch the game last night?”
Cas laughs again, but it turns into a sad-sounding sigh. “I’m sorry I betrayed your trust the last time we met. I think we could have been good friends, Dean.”
Suddenly that feeling Dean's had swirling inside of him all day rears up, like a wave crashing over him. He's overcome with the urge to say it.
“You know anything that might help his case?” He pauses. “Or anything that might hurt it?”
Dean feels a trickle of humor leak through him. He gives Cas a thankful, crooked smile. “Well, when you put it like that…”
Dean singing along to
“LM was killed by a hit and run in Ohio.”
Dean nods, bolstered by his brother’s determination. “Fuck it. I’m in if you are, Sammy.”
Instead, he just smiles faintly back at Dean, guilt twisting sickly under his skin, and resolutely turns back to survey the ivy-covered walls of Ridgemont Prep. They’re here for a reason. They need to see how hard it will be to get inside.
sharp. Dean shrugs as he munches happily on his croissant. “Kind of my whole thing.”
Channing shrugs. “I go to Ridgemont Prep with him. I don’t know him that well, but everybody knows he lost his scholarship. Is that why you’re meeting with him?”
“Me neither.”
“I owe you, Dean! I do. Dad never did me any favors, but you…” Sam sighs. “Look, I know you’re the one who pays my tuition. Dad was going to leave me hanging. Hell, he left us both hanging all our lives. But you always made sure I had food to eat and clothes to wear. I know that my life has been easier than yours. Because I had
“Maybe I missed my little brother.”
“I don’t
Jack shrugs. “I like to collect things. I also have a marker, a toothpick, and a paper clip.”
Things move quickly after Sam rallies the troops. They end up in the room Charlie booked for Castiel and Jack—which is cleaner than the room Dean, Charlie, and Sam were sharing and doesn’t smell like dirty socks. Everyone is chattering excitedly, ready to make like David and take down the Goliath. It’s a weird job. They won’t be stealing anything, but they’ll be using their considerable skills to do something good. Make it right. There’s something healing about it.
“I got it,” Jack says. The safe door is hanging open behind him and Jack is holding a brown ledger aloft. It looks old and beat up. Dean feels a wave of relief rush through him. They did it. They actually—
Dean shrugs, letting the fridge swing shut, and trying not to show how pleased he is at that suggestion. He deserves to celebrate, dammit. Somehow, he made it to 42. That deserves more than a perfunctory
“Jack, wait!” Cas hears Dean yell from behind him. “Don’t just dump everything in the pie crust, you need to mix it
“No,” Sam says. “No, our mom wasn’t murdered.”

“I mean…” Sam is looking deeply disturbed now. “You are

“Meaning, he would disapprove of us going after Free Will Enterprises?”

“Cool,” Jack breathes. “I’ve never had a crew. Or a family.”
Dean isn’t so sure how he likes being referred to as a

would knock him upside the head if she knew he came here alone. As soon as she finds out he snuck away, he’s going to get an earful. But Dean’s desperate. He wouldn’t be here if he wasn’t.
Cas frowns. “I didn’t give you my bank account information.”
side of Dean Winchester.
True to Bobby’s word, when Dean shuffles into the dining room everyone else is already there. Jack is chattering to Bobby and Sam, and Charlie is at the continental breakfast spread, loading up a plate with as many pastries as she can fit. Castiel is slouched next to Jack, clutching a mug of coffee and looking like he’s considering committing violence on anyone who dares to speak to him. Dean takes a small comfort in that. At least he’s not the only one looking like death warmed over.
Someone snorts in derision in the earbud. Castiel. “
“Yeah, so?” he mutters, shoving his hands in his pockets.
"Uh," Sam coughs after a moment. Dean can
“Can we help you?” he asks.
Sam’s already shaking his head. “When will you and dad
He can see Cas staring at him out of the corner of his eye, but Dean keeps his eyes on the road.
Well.
Cas had been stuck at the stove, stirring each pot periodically to make sure nothing boiled over. It was mind-numbing. Cranberry sauce. Gravy. Caramel sauce. Green beans. Cranberry sauce. Gravy. Caramel sauce. Green beans. Cranberry sauce—
“Cas?” Sam asks again.
He turns to give Dean an annoyed look, and almost runs straight into a kid texting on his phone. The kid is wearing a beanie and sunglasses—one of those too cool for school types that’s too busy on his phone to pay attention to the world around him. He twists out of the way just in time to avoid a collision, but fumbles his phone. It bounces on the sidewalk and lands at Sam’s feet.
, Caaaaaaas!” Dean screams, scrabbling desperately to wrap his arms, legs, hell—his whole body around Cas. He closes his eyes tight and waits for death.
“I know, I know,” Dean’s groaning. “I said

It doesn’t matter.
Jack takes a running leap off the edge with no warning. “
“Don’t make promises you can’t keep, Dean.” Sam sighs. “Let me pack a bag.”
“It’s alright,” the kid says. He turns and runs straight into Dean. He yelps, dropping his phone again.
“Yes!” Dean shouts. “Friends don’t throw friends off of buildings, Cas.”
“You seeing anything helpful?” Dean asks. He waves his phone. “Charlie’s asking about security cameras.”
anyone on this trip. He’s prepared to grit his teeth and get this over with. He only has to do it for a day, then it’s back to Palo Alto and studying and making coffee runs for the real lawyers. Back to normal.
“Cas, I can help,” Dean tries.
Reggie Baker is already fumbling with the door, cursing as he unlocks it and exits the building. He freezes before he can get too far, sending a suspicious look at Dean and pointedly locking the door behind him again before he bustles away.
A shiver worms it’s way through Cas’ stomach. “Happy Thanksgiving, Dean.”
Cas raises an eyebrow. “You did. You said you wanted to see if I was as strong as I claimed to be.”
Dean stares at him for another moment longer, trying to figure out what his game is before he abruptly gives up. He collapses into the chair next to him, muttering under his breath. Whatever. Drinking with someone he hates is only marginally better than drinking alone, but he has to take his wins where they come.
"You'll keep in touch, right Sam?" Ellen asks.
“Yep,” Charlie grins. “He’s more himself now.”
“Do you two know each other?” Sam asks, looking between them.

investigate your attack. Those two things are not mutually exclusive.” He sighs. “If you want to cooperate, this might go easier on you. We got a tip there was a ledger on the premises. You know where it is?”
. Justice for mom, but also for every person in that ledger. For every powerless person who got screwed over just because some asshole had enough money to play judge, jury, and executioner. I want to
“Why not?” Dean frowns down at his glass, trying to ignore the sting of rejection. He should’ve known.
“What are
“Cas!” Dean snaps.
Every time Sam thinks about his old life, he remembers dingy motel rooms and seedy bars. Places where people could go to lay low and exist under the radar. Places you could lose yourself in if you weren’t careful. Sam’s bracing himself for more of the same. When Dean pulls up to a chic little coffee shop, he stares in surprise.
Sam sends him a wary look. “You doing okay, Dean? Looks like you had a rough night.”
Cas closes his eyes. “Ah. That.”
“Jack is very good at his job,” Castiel puts in.
Bobby throws his hands up in the air. “Yeah. I don’t talk to your
good people.
“Tisha,” Ellen corrects helpfully.
Cas managed a silent takedown in the amount of time it takes Dean to decide on which drink he wants to order at a bar. If Dean hadn’t seen him in action before—brutal and efficient—he wouldn’t believe it.
“Uh-uh,” he says, shaking his head. “Nope. Cas can fight them off, right Cas?”
Dean stares at the phone. Ignore it? He
There’s a ten-foot-tall brick wall around the perimeter of the school and a wrought iron gate that’s supposed to keep out unwanted visitors. They’re parked across the street, trying to catch glimpses inside every time the gate swings open. So far, Cas has seen a lot of ivy-covered walls and ugly uniforms. It brings back unpleasant memories.
Sam scowls at Dean, who grins into a cup of coffee that Charlie slid over to him. Sam sits down and gets a cup slid over to him too. He stares at it in surprise.
His eyes flick uncertainly down to where Dean is still clinging onto Cas’ hand. Cas moves to drop his hand, but Dean tightens his grip unconsciously.
, Dean mouths at him.
“Be glad I didn’t do more.”
“Black coffee’s fine,” Sam interrupts, feeling more discombobulated than he thought he would. “So, you work with Dean? No offense, but you’re not exactly what I was picturing.”
Cas jerks, eyes wide. “Sam, they are…not good people.”
way.”
Dean thinks stubbornly. Even if he's changed his mind, Cas deserves to hear it. Dean deserves to say it. But— “Wait,” Cas says again, sounding panicked. “Just—"
Castiel smiles, a barely there thing. “Neither do I.”
. Dean lifts his glass up in thanks, only to falter when he sees Castiel nod back at him. What in the fuck—
“Sam, this hiding spot is taken,” Cas finally says.
Dean sighs and leans against the building to wait. There’s a security camera trained right on the door, but Dean isn’t worried. If Charlie did her job right, that camera will just be showing looped footage for the next 5 minutes. And Charlie always does her job right. The person Dean’s worried about is Cas. This next part all depends on him.
