"On the shore," Sherlock answered, and the human looked at him with confusion.
When the kiss finally did end, Sherlock increased the pressure on John's neck, keeping him close. He didn't want to lose the warmth around them, didn't want the moment to end.
In some places, it sinks deeper than any anchor can go—deeper than even the heaviest of steel attached to the largest, most majestic of vessels can fathom reaching. Mankind has not been able to determine the true depths of the sea but one thing is for sure – it would take ages to reach the bottom, and it is there where the sea folk dwell.
But this promise stayed unfulfilled for Mycroft never told Sherlock when exactly he was grown up. If it weren't for their mother, he would have swum up to the surface already but he didn't want to worry her any more. However, this didn't keep Sherlock from swimming out of the palace at night, and looking up to the surface longingly, watching the blurry forms of ships passing by, or the dim light of the stars.
"Stay." Sherlock whispered so quietly that even someone with perfect hearing would have had difficulty understanding. But John, wonderful loyal John, understood anyway. A little smile tugged at his lips and he reflexively shifted closer to Sherlock who was becoming increasingly nervous.
"Sh-Sherlock…" he whispered in awe, taking a step closer to him. "Oh, how I missed you!"
Sherlock put his hands together, palms up, then bent his fingers upwards as well, shaking his head.
hadn't been what good friends do, not so close, not so passionate, not so long.
"Then why are you now a human?" John wanted to know, blue eyes looking at Sherlock questioningly.
“Why not?” John looks sad. “Don't you think it would be disappointing that in another universe we have not met?”
It doesn't annoy me in the slightest. SH
"You hardly play your violin anymore," John's voice suddenly resonated from a corner. The words were still slurred but it got better.
He had been crying.
“Hm.”
But he doesn't.
It happens every once in awhile that John asks Sherlock to spell-check his blog entries. Not often, mind – John isn't too fond of getting insulted.
But yet, Sherlock still hadn’t told John the three magic words, and John hadn’t either. He knew he loved Sherlock, oh, and
“John, for
(a "violin", Mycroft had told him) – whenever he wasn't busy eating cake. Mycroft used to spend most of his time at the surface before he had gotten married, learning just like Sherlock, and he loved to share his knowledge with his brother.
Donovan and Anderson laughed about that 'arm-waving' at first until John, beaming widely, gave them the finger. This made them shut up.
“Well,” he begins, “just imagine – what would our lives be like today if I hadn't bumped into Mike some years ago? Or what if I hadn't got shot? What if you hadn't talked to Mike about needing a flatmate?”
“You heard me. It’s what I call it when young folk like you and Sherlock don’t act on your impulses and instead, sling insults or side-eyes at each other till one or both of you go mad. I see it all the time in the company.”
Sherlock moaned at the thought of those fingers finally doing things to him that he’d only dared himself to dream about in the darkness and safety of his own room in the blackest part of the night.
“That was fucking brilliant.”
Mycroft raised one thin eyebrow in contradiction.
The day before opening, the tenuous thread of rational thought linked to John inside Sherlock’s mind snapped. He watched John place a thermos of honeyed-tea and one of his prized jazz albums into the arthritic hands of Mr Baynes as a thank you for the poetry, and suddenly, the walls of the studio glowed red. He hated someone else being the center of John’s attention, even if that someone was an aging, (thankfully) straight man whom Sherlock could easily outwit, out dance and out fuck any day.
John looked up, a flash of anger returning to his eyes. “Excuse me?”
“Is this what we’ve come to? You bribing me for quality time?”
There was a patch of light streaming in through the closed window, slicing over his right thigh, the heat of the summer afternoon clinging to his overly sensitized skin. He didn’t know whether to roll towards the feeling or away as a torrent of conflicting emotions raced through his mind.
Mycroft straightened his tie, the physical representation of reigning in his frustration. “Noted, Mr Watson.”
"Sherlock!"
She smirked and clinked her own tumbler with his, and they sipped in companionable silence for all of thirteen seconds before Irene cut right to the chase.
Sherlock sighed. “John, how many times do I have to tell you that beauty is a social construct--”
“Jesus, Sherlock!” John punched out through his teeth, his need to thrust becoming painfully clear. Sherlock pulled off, licking his lips and smiling at the strange new experience of finding the bitter aftertaste of precome on his tongue.
“Bullshit.”
He sagged at the piano bench, his curls coming to rest along the white pages of John’s hand-scrawled music, the sheets cool and crisp beneath his forehead. He could read the notes easily enough, but would only ever want for John to play them. If he closed his eyes he could hear their ghostly echo in the room, resonating in the wood, the walls, and vibrating through the keys beneath his fingertips. He breathed in deep and exhaled, feeling uncharacteristically idle.
“I want to learn,” was all Sherlock said, and John dropped his head with a groan. This man was going to give him a heart attack sounding so eager and looking like he did with all his strong-willed defiance and vulnerability mixing together to create the impossible combination of emotions that only Sherlock could wear while still holding his head high.
Mycroft didn’t allow his brother’s smile to last for long. “I take it you won’t mind being sent back to England, then? Away from your precious company, and your precious pet? The Royal Ballet has informed me that if you were to apolog--”
John didn’t call out to him. Instead, he watched him go. The gentle lines of Sherlock’s back muscles moving and twisting along his spine as he pulled the door handle to the solarium open and disappeared inside, all grace and poise and utter, unfailing, infuriating, upper-class arrogance.
John was right the other night when he’d called him a coward.
“Sherlock?” The boy was suspiciously absent though Martha could hear violin music coming from upstairs. She nodded to herself, satisfied that her charge was safely ensconced in his own world for the evening and went to roll herself a marijuana cigarette with the latest ‘chronic’ her neighbor Jerrold had provided her with - the darling man. She would be needing some herbal assistance to steady herself for the onslaught of verbal abuse her young prodigy would no doubt soon be hurling at her when he learned the news that they would no longer be a two-person household, but three.
Two discordant notes hit the air in a spasm of sound before John leaned into the piano and smoothed out the startling beats into a sweet repeating phrase. He continued filling the room with his aching soul echoing out through the music and Sherlock felt himself moving into the center of the studio, lead by the coaxing, addicting pull of inspiration. He spun and stalked and stretched to the sounds John weaved him through the piano's keys, and allowed his body to move with the music, feeling its push to and fro and up and down and side to side. He improvised along with John and closed his eyes as he did, feeling more free and open than he’d ever experienced since the first time he’d stepped on a professional stage in white tights dancing the role of Albrecht in Giselle with The Royal Ballet.
him practically burned inside Sherlock’s bones. He wanted to know everything and yet was simultaneously terrified of what that meant.
A trickling tease of a melody soon turned into a pounding cacophony of sound. John played until the hairs at the nape of his neck clung together with sweat and a droplet ran down under the collar of his shirt along the line of his backbone to settle at the base of his spine. He played until his fingers went numb from the consistent pressure forced upon them and continued working on muscle memory alone, allowing the music to play him, to use his body as means of creation.
She didn’t explain any further, but simply shook her head and walked out of the studio. Sherlock starred after her, blinking hard. If he were a computer, this would be the part where he’d short circuit and smoke would start to pour out of his ears, John thought before the rest of what Irene had just said came flooding back to him.
John’s anger bled out of him at Sherlock’s ensuing silence, leaving only regret and stabbing guilt in its wake. He nodded and turned from the room, closing the doors behind him with a dull thud that sparked Sherlock back to the present. He blinked at the closed doors, the lack of heat in the room, and the absence of John. He immediately wanted John back. He wanted his fierce strength and fighting will. He wanted him to rail and scream at him for being a jealous, selfish idiot, to fight for him, to explain to him what he’d meant, as opposed to his resigned, quiet departure. It was all wrong. Everything about what just happened had been wrong. John was right, Sherlock was a child. And he hated himself for it, he hated the emotions coursing through him and all of their unstoppable, telling baggage they carried with them.
“He’s drugged, Molly.”
The one glaring dissimilarity between the two of them was Sherlock’s competitive need to remain solitary. He had seen his brother over the years grow tall, proud and successful employing the same tactic and found no reason not to follow in his footsteps in hopes of achieving the same end. It was like a game to him, a strange, alienating game where he allowed himself to be outcast from society and relished the strength he found in being content with his own solitude.
The revelation caused Sherlock to experience his first ever flummoxing of a performance. In his shock, he tripped.
“No. Not at all. Your house is beautiful, Mrs H.”
John shook his head and stood up from the table, leaving the madwoman behind with her purple haze. He’d been having a perfectly mediocre day and she had to go and ruin that mediocrity with her mothering and pot smoke and it was all a bit much. He needed to be alone. He needed to play.
“And I understand that the custom of this day is to spend it with loved ones and people that love you and to give them stupidly soppy little gifts.”
Sherlock giggled and yawned again.
laptop – and puts it on the table with a loud
And then the day came when Sherlock couldn't hold himself back anymore. The idea of swimming up to the surface, breaching it, and finally seeing what everyone was raving about, became too tempting for him. One night, he silently left his bedchamber and the palace, not looking back once. The sea was as dark as the night sky in his brother's tales but Sherlock found his way quickly. He never took a wrong turn, just kept swimming and swimming, the glowing of the palace disappearing beneath him with every mile he swam.
Then John's smile became a wicked grin, and with a "And now I can finally hear what kind of noises come from your gorgeous mouth" he yanked off Sherlock's pyjama pants and pulled the blanket over the two of them.
believe you."
joined hands, transitioning into one another and forming the melody – when
His hands wandered from Sherlock's shoulder blades over his back to the seam of his shirt almost by themselves. John questioningly tugged at it and got a nod as an answer. Slowly he pulled the shirt out of Sherlock's trousers and started to unbutton it. Sherlock's breathing quickened by the second and John immediately reacted.
John stared at Sherlock's mouth in concentration and then shook his head in resignation.
Sherlock laughed, laughed so loud and John laughed with him.
The memory of John made him strong and brave, and he swam on, until he reached the witch's house. White bones of men lay next to it for Irene was known for doing unspeakable things to her clients.
"So it really was just temporary," Sherlock stated and cursed himself for saying the obvious. But John didn't care. He didn't even care
Their lips touched with certainty but barely moved, mouths closed. The only contact points were their lips, their knees, their hands, John's hand on Sherlock's neck that gently threaded through the curls, and Sherlock's hand in John's jumper. The former noticed the pressure of John's fingers sometimes increasing, sometimes lessening, always soft and gentle.
John squeezed back.
“What?” John looked up. “No,
"I love the sea," John suddenly said, shifting closer to Sherlock. "You come from it, don't you?"
When John was fully recovered – apart from the problems with his ears – Sherlock immediately started dragging him along to every crime scene available. John did understand this; after all Sherlock had neglected his work for the sake of caring for John.
“I love you, too, John,” said Sherlock, and it was the most perfect gift of them all.
Yes, they had been in a relationship for seven months. Yes, they were happy together, very much so, and Sherlock had turned out to be much of a cuddler – to John’s surprise and pleasure. They had shared several kisses, sweet and soft, passionate and wanting. They held hands whenever they deemed it appropriate, and they hugged at least twice a day.  More, if Sherlock allowed it. At night, they curled up together in Sherlock’s bed, bodies pressed close together, feeling the other’s heart beat.
“Do you sometimes think about what would have happened if we hadn't met?” John asks one evening as Sherlock and he are sitting side by side on their sofa, both enjoying a book and occasionally sipping tea.
John realised that he didn't want to be somewhere else, just here with Sherlock, and there was nothing in the world that could have stopped him from kissing this man. He was happy and hoped that Sherlock felt the same way.
In a rush, Sherlock fell to his knees and took John’s face into his hands. “You’re
“Should I be afraid now?” John jokes but obeys and sits down.
Sherlock had given him his heart.
But John never stopped thinking about all the possibilities, about how different his life could have been at any point. It was fun, it was interesting, and it was something that cured his boredom.
“Sure,” John answers and clears his throat, nervously licking his lips. “And I'm bloody glad it turned out like that.” He hopes to elicit a smile from Sherlock but fails – his face is still the cold mask he always wears. “But – Afghanistan always got me thinking, back when I was still a soldier. I was always wondering how I would have ended up if I hadn't joined the Army, if I had continued to be a doctor in a hospital, not on a battlefield.”
John's hands trembled in the air when he asked this question and he had to swallow when Sherlock hesitated, his lips forming a thin line. John went through various plans of escape in his head should Sherlock's answer be negative. Should he move to escape the awkward atmosphere that would doubtlessly come? Should he stay and act as if this talk had never taken place?
, John. Not catched."
He still couldn't hear, though.
"John!"
controlled John's heartbeat, and when thirds, sixths and octaves charmed and fascinated him.
Three months passed and Sherlock and John perfected their sign language. They could communicate at crime scenes, without exception. While Sherlock was rattling off his deductions, he simultaneously translated them for John. If he had questions, he silently asked them, always receiving an answer.
John put the mobile away and took Sherlock's other hand, leaning forward and touching his brow to Sherlock's. He closed his eyes while the detective observed him. This quiescent, this togetherness, this intimacy.
The Consulting Detective was able to elicit the most beautiful melodies out of his violin and John gloomily remembered how much he had enjoyed them. Whenever he suffered from a nightmare, right at the beginning of their friendship, Sherlock started playing Tschaikowski and Bach in the middle of the night, John's favourite composers. The doctor was fascinated by Sherlock's own compositions as well, closing his eyes enraptured when
John sighs and closes his eyes for a fraction of a second. “I could have been dead because the bullet could have hit my head instead of my shoulder. You could be dead if some of your dangerous cases had gone wrong. In fact, we both probably could never have met.”
Far out in the ocean, the water is as blue as the sky on a bright summer's day, as blue as a cornflower's petal when it shines in full bloom, and as clear as the purest glass one will ever find, very much like the glass used at court. It glitters warmly when it reflects the warm rays of the sun, and appears peaceful and calm.
John doesn't know when this started, really. Maybe at the age of four, five? He would sometimes ask his mother questions like, “What if you and Daddy had never met? I wouldn't be born then, would I? Somebody else would have my place.” And it made him incredibly sad to know that he maybe didn't exist in a different universe. His mother usually laughed, and so did his father, and Harry, of course.
So he just glares at John when he yells, once again, "To who it may concern, I'm not actually gay!"
John smiled against Sherlock's lips and let his tongue dart forward, smoothing over Sherlock's bottom lip and applying pressure to Sherlock's mouth that immediately opened. Softly, John let his tongue slide in, looking for Sherlock's and gently nudging it.
John knew that Sherlock was currently collecting all the information he could gather, and he gave him this time. Plus, he quite liked to be kissed so thoroughly.
Sherlock pushed him back into the pillows gently and whipped out his notebook in which he had written everything about the incident and handed it to John. While the doctor let his gaze roam over Sherlock's fluent script, his brow crinkled in a frown. He looked up, blinked once, twice and gestured a writing motion with his hand. Sherlock handed him a pen and couldn't help but notice John blinking repeatedly.
And apparently, John prefers texting him, too. However, he uses a rather stupid texting language that Sherlock never quite understood the appeal of.
The genius looks up after a minute or two and stares at John with that intense gaze of his, fingers tented beneath his chin. “Why would you think about questions like these, John?” he asks, truly wondering about John's reason. “We are here now, this is what counts, is it not?”
John immediately reacted, stretched his legs and let himself fall backwards into the pillows, hands roaming over Sherlock's torso, his neck, his sides, just to return to his hair, playing with the curls. Sherlock lowered himself a bit, chest touching John's, his legs framing the doctor's.
Sherlock cursed himself for not anticipating this bomb. The culprit they had chased had not only been a murderer but also a bomber who of course had worn an explosive belt. He detonated himself when John and Sherlock had forced him into a blind lane. Sherlock had been able to hide behind a rubbish skip just in time and wanted to pull John behind him but he failed. The doctor threw himself on the ground and tried to escape the pressure wave this way but that hadn't helped much. The bomb of the culprit exploded, just like the little stone wall behind him. Splinters of bricks were flying through the air, and three hit John's head and back—hurting him badly.
Sherlock's eyes went wide. "Can you hear me?" he asked, exaggerating the movement of his mouth and talking especially slowly. He had read that it was easier to lip-read when the volume of speech wasn't increased or decreased, but instead stayed normal.
He knew he had to do something, anything. So he picked up his mobile again.
"Sherlock…," John whispered indistinctly after a while and blinked.
“I agree that it would be – different.”
Their lips parted for a short time when they both had to break apart for air, but immediately met again, and it still felt like their first kiss without having ever been interrupted.
John looked up, nodded, and smiled, then continued to look at Sherlock. He could see how Greg sighed and returned to his co-workers. They used to chat with each other from time to time but now not even a dirty joke was possible.
(things like animal ears or similar things. The doctor was fed up with experiments at the moment).
The Consulting Detective got up, slowly walking towards John. He put a gentle hand on his shoulder and when his blogger looked up, he said "Come with me". John couldn't hear him and yet he understood. A smile tugged at John's lips when he saw John's confused expression.
They don't talk about this topic again that evening. But it hasn't been forgotten. John continues to think about what-ifs, and Sherlock does wonder, too, sometimes. He knows for a fact that his life with John has been wonderful, that he actually was happier than ever before.
John sighs and rubs his hands over his thighs. “Listen. I already said that I would still be that lonely soldier with a hurting leg and a bad shoulder had you never entered my life.”
Nothing gave Sherlock such pleasure, however, as to hear about the world of the human beings up above them. He kept something with him that he took great care of and had found it on the bottom of the sea floor, apparently fallen from a ship. He had looked at it intently and found that it produced sounds when one picked at the strings that were taut over its wooden carcass. Sherlock had no name for it, and chose to call it
John opened the envelope, trying to ignore his shaking hands. He pulled out a piece of paper that turned out to be a scan of an x-ray of a human thorax. The centre of the image was the heart, hidden behind the ribs but still clearly visible. In the upper left corner it said
Sherlock's mobile stayed quiet. John didn't write again.
“God, Sherlock.” John framed his face with his hands and pulled him closer, noses touching. “This is the best possible gift you could have given me, you git.”
The sun had not yet risen when Sherlock emerged from the water and swam to the beach. He sat there for a while; staring at the water and feeling his heart grow heavy. When the sun rose and the world awoke, Sherlock took the potion and swallowed the bitter liquid and it was as if a sword cut through his body, just like Irene had promised. The pain did not subside but he saw that he had two well-shaped, strong legs and he could walk around.
Sherlock blinked.
The light in John's room was dimmed and the doctor knelt on the bed. With one hand he reached out for Sherlock, a silent Thank-You for the texts. He clutched his mobile with his other hand.
Sherlock told him to stop and wait, then went to fetch his violin case. He carefully took the precious instrument out of its case and returned to John who looked at him with wide eyes. Sherlock handed him the bow and he took it, frowning.
They started talking about this and that, and finally John decided to give Sherlock a bed at his place so he could stay there, all the while wondering where his fish tail had gone, but never asking. They spent two wonderful weeks together in which Sherlock was happier than he ever had been, although the pain in his legs constantly reminded him of Irene's ultimatum.
came from Sherlock's mouth…
But this was for John. And he would do anything for John.
.” Sherlock’s voice became more urgent and he leaned forward, their foreheads almost crashing together. What was
"The ambulance will be here shortly," he informed his best friend. "If those idiots weren't always short-staffed, one of them would be here already!" Sherlock's face clearly showed how angry he was about the incompetence of the people around him, especially now when it concerned John. He just couldn't lose him! John was his colleague with his detective work, his blogger, his doctor, and most of all – his best friend. He wasn't allowed to die now, even if it looked like it would happen soon. Unsurprisingly, after all, a bomb had just exploded next to him.
Sherlock released him, withdrew his tongue, and kissed John's closed lips. John opened his eyes and looked at Sherlock who was blushing, lips reddened and moist and kiss-swollen.
He slowly pulled down the zip and opened the button, gently pulling the trousers off Sherlock. The detective was now breathing harder, a writhing mess beneath John. He deliberately ignored Sherlock's middle, not wanting to rush this, wanting to show Sherlock what it meant to be loved.
"No," his brother answered, "not unless a human being loved you so that his whole heart was yours—so that he would give you his hand in marriage and be with you for eternity and you joined him in his world. Then his soul would dwell in your body, and you would die with him and not turn into foam."
“John.” Sherlock’s deep voice echoed through the flat. He stood in front of John, more or less looming over him. He was clad only in his blue bathrobe, a nicotine patch peeked out of his sleeve, and his curls were unruly as ever. Given that it was ten AM, he probably only just got up.
Sherlock looked up at John whose eyes were watery again. His brave soldier kept a hold of himself, though, and returned his look.
"Stay," Sherlock repeated and swallowed again, trying to blink away his insecurity. This was unfamiliar territory to him. For the first time in his life he didn't quite know what to do. Of course he knew about the theoretical aspects but this, John – everything was completely different.
Pure happiness.
"As a matter of fact, I do," Sherlock answered, his eyes carrying a certain yearning as he looked upon the waves.
Before he could lean down and pepper Sherlock's body with more kisses, however, Sherlock reached out for John's jeans, tugging at them questioningly and John understood. He quickly stepped out of his jeans and let Sherlock explore his body. His hands mapped everything. John took this time to kiss and caress Sherlock as well, pleasuring and fondling him.
Curiosity is clearly visible on John's face. “And what would that be?”
It all happened so fast.
It is a fact that John makes him happy, he thinks, and if he hadn't met John, his life would still be dull and boring. It sometimes is tedious nowadays as well, but less so whenever John is around. John, John, John. His doctor, his blogger, his flatmate, his friend.
John thinks the same, actually. He knows that Sherlock turned everything in his life upside down and he made him feel alive once again, even more so if John is quite honest with himself. Sherlock is the quiet before the oncoming storm, and he is the storm himself, and frankly, it's all what John needs. Sherlock is brilliant and clever and mad and annoying and wonderful and just perfect. He gives John all he wants, and so much more than that.
You are vital to it even when you can't hear me. SH
Sherlock annoyed the nurses and doctors with this topic as often as possible. He demanded they bring John's hearing back, no matter how. They promised him over and over again that they would give their best but most of the time it was just an excuse, a little fib so they could continue their work without being interrupted by him. At some point they stopped talking to Sherlock entirely so he had no other option than to sit next to John's bed and hope.
Sherlock returned to Mycroft's palace and isolated himself even more from the others. Many evenings and many mornings he revisited the spot where he had seen John for the last time. He saw fruits growing close to the shore, he saw snow melting away, but he didn't see John anymore and became sadder every time he returned home.
John smiled. The first time in days.
For the first time in his life, Sherlock Holmes was completely, fully happy.
The human's eyes were closed. They weren't blue now, Sherlock noted sadly, they were closed and pale, just like the rest of the body. His left shoulder was still bleeding. The bang Sherlock had heard probably was the reason for this injury. What had Mycroft called it?
Sherlock looked at John expectantly but he just swallowed heavily. His fingers hovered above the keys of his mobile for a bit until he finally settled on an answer.
After Sherlock released him, John straightened a bit and did the same, playing with Sherlock's lips until he relaxed, truly relaxed, heaving a contented sigh. His hand left John's jumper, looking for a new place. This time he cupped John's face and pulled him closer. He let his hand wander lower to John's neck, taking his pulse and feeling how ecstatically John's heart was beating. That this was because of him, Sherlock, was almost too good to be true for the Consulting Detective.
, and John realised.
"Oh God.
“That we have absolutely no reason to be sad or upset about any possible scenarios.”
John's hand signed in the air. Sherlock nodded curtly, nervously. John observed how the muscles in his jaw worked and had to smile involuntarily. He had never been someone's first kiss and it was an even greater honour for him to be Sherlock's first. A fleeting brush of lips – it was supposed to be wonderful for Sherlock, John decided. Even if he was useless otherwise, this should prove to Sherlock that John was good for him—that he had a reason to exist.
Louder giggling.
!" John sat up as well, staring at Sherlock and pointing at his ears over and over again. "I can hear. I can hear again!"
During the next case, John's mobile buzzed in his coat pocket and when he threw a glance at the display, there was a message from Sherlock with all the relevant facts for this case. Whenever Sherlock had a question or found something, he grabbed his phone and texted John. This way, he could follow the investigation properly.
, John," Sherlock corrects casually, "Also, nobody will
The human just stared at him, his torso, his tail, back to his face. "John. Very… very nice to meet you." He was so polite, politer than any of the sea folk. Sherlock felt obliged to explain why exactly the human was on the beach with him, and told him what he had seen. The man nodded, looked at his shoulder and sighed.
Slowly but surely Sherlock started to become frightened. It was an irrational feeling and he hated it, yet he couldn't do anything against either the panic induced quickness of his heartbeat, or his ragged breathing. "John, please, talk to me!"
John mouthed a sad "Oh".
Slowly, John retreated a bit, turning towards the door. His hands sank back to his body and he was about to stretch his legs and put them on the floor when warm fingers touched his, pulling him back into his former position.
John blinks at him.
John turned his mobile off with a smile and snuggled up under the duvet. This text would steal Sherlock's thunder for at least a little while. The consulting detective still wasn't used to it that John expressed his fondness for his best friend, even after all those years they lived together.
John hesitantly took the envelope which carried his name in Sherlock’s curly, elegant handwriting. He gently opened it, his heart beating wildly in his chest. He’d have never thought that Sherlock…
John opened his mouth but closed it again soon. He didn’t know what to say. Sherlock apparently didn’t, either, as he thrust an envelope in John’s face and looked away again.
He explored Sherlock's legs inch for inch and when he reached his hips, he straightened again and gently kissed him. Sherlock looked at him and swallowed once, twice, before he formed "Don't stop" with his mouth. John smiled again and pulled his jumper over his head. Sherlock's hands roamed over his chest in the meantime, cheekily unbuttoned the shirt he was still wearing.
Plus, the case seemed to be interesting but he simply didn't
The only thing that worried him, though, was his temporary deafness. How should he answer Sherlock's question concerning medicine if he couldn't hear them? How should he always be up to date?
anything. No observation, no clues,
"Morning," Sherlock replied sleepily and yawned. "Dunno why 'm so tired," he added mumbling.
His gaze didn't leave Sherlock's face the entire time, ready to stop should it become too much for the detective. But there were no signs for that at the moment, on the contrary.
The doctor just smiled and gently withdrew his hand from Sherlock's grip, cupping Sherlock's cheek and softly tracing his cheekbone with his thumb. He wanted to make him feel safe and secure without restricting or overwhelming him.
Sherlock likes proper grammar, he loathes mistakes – and he doesn't understand why people switch to faulty colloquial speech when they are angry, or upset in general.
“What's up?” he asks, looking around. “Shall I send a text to a murderer or something?”
When John finally answered after what seemed to be an eternity, Sherlock almost dropped his mobile—startled by the ring tone. He needed a bit to compose himself, especially after the confession he had just made. It cost him an incredible amount of effort to find the bravery for such a feat. He, the emotionless Sherlock—love is a chemical defect—Holmes.
Sherlock stares at John's closed hands. He doesn't
However, Sherlock did notice a change in their conversation. Suddenly, "his" human being stood up, flourishing his hands in what could only be an angry manner. The other man stood, too, now, and the boat wavered a bit. The two men shouted at one another, and there was suddenly a loud bang, a cry, and then the taller man rowed back to the shore quickly.
he knew. But he didn’t want to overwhelm him, didn’t want to risk anything. The Consulting Detective was, after all, not very experienced when it came to relationships and love, and John didn't want to scare him away, maybe even lose him forever - so he left the topic of love alone.
"Also, you will have to pay me." Irene laughed again, circling Sherlock with a piercing glance. "It is not a trifle matter, I assure you. You have the most wonderful talent of playing the violin and I don't doubt you would captivate the doctor with it. You must give this talent to me, and I will compose the best potion I have."
John chuckles. “I know, you prat. But that's not the point. The thing is, if a thing had gone differently in our lives, just one tiny little thing, we would not be where we are now. Don't you agree?”
Sherlock's face lit up in a beaming smile but Mycroft's expression stayed as dark as the night. "This can never come to pass, Sherlock. The beauty of yours here in the sea is your fish tail, but you can't walk with it on land and you would be avoided for having it."
"Sherlock," he answered, "a merman of the sea."
All his thoughts are just so confusing, and sometimes even depressing.
John blinked. “Well done, Sherlock, you actually looked at the calendar I gave you. I'm proud.” With that he shook his head in confusion and picked up his laptop to continue working, but was interrupted by a cold hand that had an iron grip on his wrist.
Extending the right hand parallel to Sherlock's body, making a fist, pointing to John.
The sea folk look just like human beings but if one possesses the good fortune to peer closer, which happens rarely because they live very secluded lives, one can spot the differences—so tiny yet so important. Their eyes shine brighter than those of man and they consist of many a colour. There is no plain blue or green. No indeed! Every eye is something special, a mixture of thousands and thousands of colours.
'He has cried. John cried because he can't hear anymore.'
In Afghanistan... well, there were some nights in which John lay on his makeshift bed, staring up at the desert sky with all its stars and hearing his comrades' cries of pain. He often wondered back then where he would be if he had never joined the Army. Or how many people would have survived if John had been in different places at different times.
It hurt the detective to see his blogger like that. He buried his nose in his friend's hairs, his fingers clenching in the doctor's jacket, and mouthed "I'm sorry" against John's forehead.
Sherlock looks up and frowns, pondering the question and apparently failing to come up with an answer. “What do you mean, John?” he asks instead, closing the book and putting it aside.
John was isolated. Without wanting to be.
It might not appear like that but Sherlock and John usually lead a relatively argument-free life. Sometimes, however, John will complain about Sherlock's experiments or his lack of kindness, which leads to a little row, but other than that, they're peaceful.
, John texted him every minute what
One day, Sherlock storms into the kitchen with the laptop –
Index and middle finger to Sherlock's forehead, sliding down to the tip of his nose.
Sherlock signed, frowning. He didn't quite understand what John wanted to hear, what he was asking. The doctor had learnt from him quite a bit and occasionally talked in riddles. It confused Sherlock. Usually, John immediately explained what he meant – but this time he just sighed and let his shoulders go slack. His gaze roamed to the floor, and he bit his lip nervously.
, after Mycroft had found him a suitable bow to play it with. The wood never moulded, and the strings never broke. Sherlock elicited the most beautiful sounds and melodies from that instrument, his fingers merely hovering over the strings, dancing over the fretboard with unprecedented elegance.
Lestrade was so kind as to bring him some cold case files so Sherlock wouldn't drown in boredom but for that it wasn't necessary to leave the house.
John smiled back. "I love you, too."
It was true, Sherlock loved John with all his heart. He who had been someone who hated the idea of love, calling it a defect, his meeting John had turned his world upside down, and he still cherished the memory of his lips against John's forehead. "I shall visit the sea witch Irene," Sherlock said to himself, "whom I have heard so much about. Everyone is afraid of her, but I am not, and I know she will be able to help me with my problem."
But underneath this happy façade, John Watson wasn't well at all. Several months had gone by and he still couldn't hear anything. He was extremely restricted because of that – working in the clinic again was impossible, and he couldn't help Sherlock with cases because he didn't hear what was going on, thus becoming a useless millstone around the Consulting Detective's neck. Though they had their sign language, communication still took too much time. When John had a question, Sherlock would of course answer it, but because he always talked so eloquently and thorough, the simple explanation of the cause of death took ten minutes. Ten minutes that Sherlock could have spent deducing.
"It's
It was then that it dawned on John that this was something completely new for Sherlock. He blinked
Of course he knew that John liked him – even though the reason for that still was a mystery for him. But those expressions of admiration were still something unexpected for Sherlock. An odd feeling came with those messages that was unfamiliar for the detective. A warmth pooling in his belly and spreading through his body, giving him goose bumps wasn't exactly his area.
Their skin is smoother than that of a human, too, silky and pale and tender. The hair of the sea folk is long and thick—soft to the touch. It never needs combed, the gentle stir and movement of the water is enough to foster it. Their voices are angelic, both when they sing and speak—bright and clear, and if they talk it's as if bells are ringing. The deeper they are, the more the water above them muffles the sound, and to human ears, their talking sounds just like the clashing of waves when they meet the shore.
It wasn't Sherlock's style to be desperate, especially not at this particular octave, but John's condition had him panicking. He couldn't bear to think his doctor dying because of the explosion. But luckily enough he was still alive; barely, but alive. And this was of the utmost importance.
“Don't you think that would be horrible?” John looks at Sherlock, expecting him to show at least a little pity. No, not pity, John doesn't need pity. Empathy, perhaps.
"I love you, John," he said with a smirk. Finally, the doctor could hear it.
John thinks that he isn't that bad of a writer. And he really isn't. If he lived in the 19th century and wrote about Sherlock's adventures, he would probably be a famous author. But he doesn't live in the past, he lives in the present, and Sherlock reminds him of that by being a huge pain in the behind.
Sherlock sighed and touched the bow to the strings again after a bit. What was wrong with his flatmate? A sad melody floated through the rooms of 221B Baker Street. It went through the walls, dancing at the ceilings, playing with the curtains and bore it's way into Sherlock's heart. Melancholia.
Every once in a while, however, he heard a little whistling sound, similar to the sounds when someone was suffering from tinnitus. His heartbeat accelerated whenever that happened. Usually, he ran downstairs to Sherlock to tell him about that but as soon as he gestured toward his ears, the sound vanished as quickly as it had appeared. The pitying look on Sherlock's face John never saw, already turning and running upstairs into his room, fighting back his tears.
Sherlock looked slightly terrified at that confession, a racehorse about to spook. John backed him into the middle of the crowd slow and steady, his arms tightening around him, their bodies pressed flush together, sweat mingling, hips moving in an easy rhythm.  It felt so good to John, so smooth and natural to guide Sherlock in this silly excuse for a dance considering they were barely able to move with the press of the crowd.
At this, Sherlock stilled. He sat there, crouched and taught before John, holding him in place. John took in every sensation, every calculating glint in Sherlock’s gaze, willing him to give him an answer, give him anything.
“I’m trying to be honest.”
Shaking his head, he picked up his mug and took a deep gulp of the dark, rich coffee, amazed at how all of that punk-filled, feminine beauty was lost to him. He stared at his ceiling at night not wishing for the soft, rounded peaks of his female coworkers to be cupped in his hands but for the bulging swell of John Watson’s cock to be pushed hard and urgent against his hip bone, between the crux of his legs, the crease of his ass and the secret flesh of his most delicate skin. He wanted the heat of John Watson's saliva-slicked tongue to lick into his mouth again with all the vigor and passion he brought to the piano keys when the frustration grew too much for him and the pounding of his fingers into the cool ivory was his only solace. Sherlock wanted to be those piano keys, he wanted to be played by John in every possible way and found that he no longer hated himself for wanting such a thing.
Sherlock did not deign to respond to John’s retort, but instead, picked up another mug off the table and drank deeply. John watched the rise and fall of Sherlock’s throat as it worked to swallow the rich, warm liquid. If he licked his lips at the sight, he told himself it was because of the taste of the coffee on his tongue and not the indulgent dip of Sherlock’s Adam’s apple moving languid and smooth along his pale, exposed neck.
As always, thank you for reading.
can.”
Holding John against him with a willing, open mind was a revelation. The strength of him, the ferocity, the barely concealed temper he struggled to keep at bay, caused by a summer’s worth of sexual frustration simmering just behind John’s eyelids. It collectively created a spark of fascination that ignited in Sherlock’s mind. He had been the cause of such emotion, and now he wanted to be the resolution. In a surge of sudden confidence, he pushed John back into the leather chair in front of the hearth, his mind racing down three definitive pathways to his next move.
“Sherlock?” John’s voice was worried, restrained yet urgent, and Sherlock despised him for sounding so concerned. He didn't deserve it.
When Sherlock came, his prick slicked wet and sucked deep into the hollows of John’s mouth, he arched backward off the bed, his eyes falling closed from the intensity of orgasm surging through every vein, every nerve ending. His hands clutched helplessly at the empty air as his arms stretched high above his head before falling heavily against the sheets, the internal strings of his body letting loose once more. It was still a novel experience, seeking and finding such intimate gratification with John. It wrung him out. He felt content, calm, practically catatonic as John lay his cheek against the flat surface of Sherlock’s stomach, his arms draped across his chest, possessive and pleasant.
“What are you saying, Sherlock?”
As always, thanks for reading!
“So, you want to tell me again how I’m going to
“Wouldn’t I? I’ve told you before, success at any cost. That was your goal once. Has spending a mere two months in the presence of John Watson changed your motivation in life?”
The elegant man stepped back and with a cheeky, yet graceful, bow welcomed John into what would become his new home. John eyed him with speculation, feeling more jittery by the second. He put down the crates of sheet music before he dropped them once inside the door, not trusting his grip. Mrs H had mentioned nothing about Sherlock living with her, or really anything about her place of residence other than that it was large, old, and had plenty of guestrooms and that John should move in as soon as he could pack his things.
As always, thank you for reading. Please leave me a comment (even if it's a shouting howler of a comment, I understand) or some kudos love if you feel so inclined. :)
Sherlock halted, frozen in place. God, that man! John was bold as brass and beautiful as ever as he sat there at his bench, snapping Sherlock in two with nothing but a smirk at the corner of his clever lips. He couldn’t take it any longer—Sherlock Holmes had had enough.
“Yoo hoo!”
“I wouldn’t rather anything, only that this happens with you.”
A grin of pure pride crossed Sherlock’s lips before he turned his eyes downward and stared at John’s thumbs rubbing circles into the backs of his own hands. “I’ve never kissed anyone like that, John. This isn’t really my area.” Sherlock frowned at the words, his gaze rising up to meet John’s once more, his eyes wide and almost wild with a thousand thoughts projecting out through their pale, calculating depths. “I’ve never wanted to before . . . I’ve never
“I’ll take you, I was just going to make myself an Old Fashioned. Do you drink cocktails, John?”
Sherlock turned from her water-filled gaze and stalked from the dining hall with a barely contained rage over their betrayal, his long coat flapping behind him in a gust of nonexistent wind. There was familial love, and then there was the overbearing and suffocating reach of Mycroft Holmes, whose paranoia and ego had finally surpassed the girth of his growing waistline. Sherlock was no longer interested in playing puppet on the long strings his brother too-easily controlled from his perch high above Downing Street. To Sherlock, the answer was simple; it was time to leave.
She and John exchanged a silent conversation the moment she saw Sherlock’s altered state and immediately flanked herself on the opposite side, helping to hold Sherlock up as he rapidly faded into semi-consciousness.
From across the stage, Sherlock couldn't help but clap along with the audience and beam at the only man he ever cared to call his own. He wolf-whistled on a whim, just to see John blush at the praise, and smiled madly at John’s reaction.
"And look where it's gotten you," Mycroft said as he toasted Sherlock with the raising of his teacup.
“Really? I hadn’t noticed.”
“You’re beautiful,” he told him, kissing one nipple. Sherlock arched into the touch, his breath staggered and stilted in the silence of the room.
John startled in the hammock, his hands falling to grip at the sides before he toppled with his own momentum. He looked down towards the ground and saw Sherlock sprawled in the soft grass with his eyes closed and his head resting against the trunk of a birch tree nearby. One eyebrow lifted as John continued to stare at him in thunderstruck wonder as if Sherlock could tell that he was being studied.
“Yes. That’s what I said. Who is he?”
John huffed and ran a hand through his hair. “What?” The bark of a question was as close to snapping as he’d come.
John sipped his drink and blinked away the emotion in his eyes as Sherlock started in on another piece. (“Something sweeter this time, dear. More soft.”) He stared hard at the moon, willing it to give him answers but it remained still, a forever silent sentinel in the night sky.
“Thank you,” he mumbled as he took his first sip. The coffee was hot and fragrant with the flavors of berry and caramel and nutmeg. He hummed his appreciation and sat heavily in the chair in front of him, his leg giving out on him, demanding reprieve.
of all people, would get him something for Valentine’s Day.
“No!” A laugh bubbled up in John’s chest. “Tears of joy, Sherlock. Happy tears. You heard of that?”
Because he has Sherlock.
As morning turned into day, bells of the churches close to the shore began to ring, and a number of people came running down to the beach, crying John's name. Sherlock quickly jumped back into the water but not without looking back at John once more. The human stared back, waving with his hand and whispering a "Thank-you". And if Sherlock was not mistaken, there stood an "I hope to see you again, mysterious creature of the sea" in his eyes.
The sea king Mycroft had been a widower for years, and had yet to recover from the death of his beloved wife. He drowned his sorrow in eating cake, day in, day out, so that his old mother kept house for him. She was a clever woman but disappointed in her eldest son, so she placed all hope into her youngest child.
Thanks to his travels, he could stop for a bite by a travelling inn, and he started talking to people. If they were cold, he looked at them and could tell their whole life story with just a glance at them. He really was remarkably intelligent and observant. After such a deduction, and maybe after one or two songs, even the most secluded ones were willing to talk and, oh, how much Sherlock learned about the human world!
Showering is boring. SH
Boring. SH
When they arrived at their first crime scene and Sherlock started whirling around, firing off his deductions at light speed, John could only stand on his own away from everything, watching Sherlock with a sad smile. When Sherlock was busy insulting Anderson, Lestrade came over to John and squeezed his shoulder.
"John, what's wrong? Are you okay? Do you feel any pain?"
John stayed silent.
No answer. That was to be expected.
In the long run, it wouldn't work with the texts and the notes. Sherlock didn't always have the nerves and the time to type everything into his mobile or jot it down so John could follow, especially not on crime scenes.
Sherlock understood, almost laughed, and intertwined his hand with John's that was resting between their bodies. John's hand wrapped around them, starting to move up and down gently, and he kissed Sherlock again. Sherlock's pupils were huge, his irises barely visible.
Sherlock sighed, and then he gave an explanation as to what had happened and John looked at him with sadness. "Do you love me best of all?" Sherlock finally asked, his heart beating wildly.
Howl, indeed.
John woke with a start, gasping and clutching at the bedclothes under him. He raised up from the unfamiliar bed he’d been dozing on, taking in the foreign room around him, wondering where the hell he was?
John looked up at him, his face a torrent of emotion, his eyes deep and wanting. “Promise me.”
He turned and resumed his sprawling on the ground next to Molly, his arms reaching up and out in front of him to mark the steps of the piece they'd been rehearsing. Notes of imaginary music drifted past his gaze as he heard the verses in his head. Molly’s thin, pale arms joined his in the air, mimicking the steps with her hands like all dancers did, and the two of them soon descended into giggles at their impeccable timing. Even without spoken counts or music to accompany them, they moved together soundlessly, the muscle memory ingrained deeply within them, the many rehearsals paying off even in this unguarded, gentle moment.
He went to make the drinks, his fingers cramping around the Waterford crystal glasses in his hands. He wanted to punch something - he wanted to fight. Normally, John would push down such instincts and channel that internal anger into playing, but the only piano at his disposal was several flights of stairs away, and Mrs H was expecting a cocktail. John steeled his nerves and returned to the patio and the pain of Sherlock’s music, hoping beyond hope that the slow, deliberate, deconstruction of his ability to hide his emotions would soon be over.
I owe a great deal of gratitude to @Nottoolateforthegame and @MandaPanda8 for their help in beta'ing/encouragement with this chapter. Thank you, ladies.
“Ho--wow.” John coughed. “That’s a strong -- erm -- cigarette you have there.”
“Cash or card?” The cabbie asked and Sherlock blinked open his eyes in time to see John hand over two twenties and utter keep the change, as he exited curbside. They had arrived. Sherlock followed John with careful steps, watching him the entire time, cataloging every swallow, every uneven shift of his feet.
Pleased with the reaction, Sherlock grinned and shimmied lower, his head coming to rest in the sloping vee between John’s hipbones. “Yes?”
John swallowed thickly at the idea of being allowed to touch any part of Sherlock’s skin, bruised or whole, and didn’t hesitate at the invitation. John knelt before the man, feeling a profound shift in their dynamic as he positioned himself on the floor at Sherlock’s feet, the humidity from Sherlock’s overheated body radiating out towards him in a wave. It was a heady moment, and John hoped that Sherlock could feel the definite change in the atmosphere around them - it was impossible to miss and Sherlock was a very observant man.
“I’ve wanted you--” Sherlock cut off his admissions as he sucked on the lobe of John’s ear and then returned to consuming his mouth. He was ravenous for the man, and now that he’d finally looked over the precipice in his mind and hurled himself into the great unknown beyond it, he couldn’t hold himself back from licking every inch of available skin he could find in front of him. He wanted to learn every freckle on John’s body, study every curve of muscle, and every line in the pads of his beautiful, talented fingertips.
End of part 1
Mycroft’s only response was to sigh and flourish the square package so that the plastic film reflected the light echoing off of the grand mirror in the front hall, temporarily blinding Sherlock’s vision.
“May I ask, how was your morning coffee? And which did you find more enjoyable, the caffeine or the company? ”
John almost said yes before he remembered he was supposed to be put out by the invasion of privacy. Irene smiled at his dazed look. “Everyone saw you two, John. So saying it’s none of my business is rather a moot point. The question is, what did you do to fuck it up?” She leaned into his space, resting a hip on the piano ledge.
John pinched the bridge of his nose and Sherlock stepped in, seeing a need to be useful and not wanting to squander it. “Quite right, John. Impeccable timing.” Sherlock bent down, kissed the back of Mrs Hudson’s hand and turned to bodily remove John from the room, perfectly content to leave Mrs Hudson to work her particular brand of magic which included the uncanny ability to both placate and aggravate at the same time.
The studio lights flicked on slowly, blinking and clamoring to life as he entered and placed his pack and thermos at the foot of the piano in his favorite room on the top floor of the company’s headquarters. The windows up here were large and arched, taking up massive spaces along the front and back walls, creating large pools of glorious light that reached across the floor and warmed his bone-weary toes.
“No, I don’t think I will. I think you and I should go have a little chat. Elsewhere.”
this holiday. Despite it having rained four out of the five days they’d been exploring the Highlands, the two of them found plenty of ways to remain occupied indoors. Playing session at a little pub sitting in the hulking shadow of the University’s spires was a spur of the moment decision to actually get them
“Sherlock,” John said, righting his clothes and moving forward in the chair to cup his face in the palms of his hands. “It’s okay.”
“I want to.”
John slumped onto the large bed in the corner of the room next to a window glowing with late afternoon light. The mattress squeaking beneath his weight as every bit of tension he’d been holding in his shoulders started to seep out through his pores and onto the floor beneath him. He’d never been so exhausted from a single conversation before in his life and he’d barely spoken. It’d been awful. Sherlock had attempted to be amiable, the worst of things, and now they shared a bloody wall.
“We do. People will be here soon. And I’m going to need a minute to calm the fuck down.”
John jogged down the hallway towards the second-floor rehearsal rooms just in time to see the dancers collectively exiting the doors of 2B. He skidded to a halt at the sight and heaved out a disappointed gust of air from his lungs that almost sounded like longing.
A slow grin crept over John’s face. “You’re impossible.”
“Oh, that was never the question.” Sherlock grinned as moved smoothly out from underneath John, only to cage him with his body on the bed. “As I said before, with you, John, I want everything.”
“Would you rather this be on a bed?” John asked as he massaged circles into the skin just above Sherlock’s hip bones. Sherlock shook his head, his damp curls falling along the sides of his face as he lay back against the pillow.
He’d meant the words to be a balm, a penitence. Instead, they spurred John into a painful retreat.
Sherlock scanned the hallway in search of Molly. She was always pressed, dressed and ready for her cue before everyone else and he knew she’d be waiting nearby as soon as he’d exited the men’s dressing room.
’. John smirked into his drink. Mrs H certainly knew how to handle the difficult man.
John’s hands immediately balled into fists at his sides as he realised what was happening. He ran after him.
Sherlock smiled into the warm skin of John’s chest, pressing a kiss to his sternum and nuzzling his nose along the ridge of his collar bone. The hair on his body fascinated Sherlock. The patterns, the differentiating shades of colour, the way it fanned out from his thighs in light, blonde fuzz and curled gently over his chest in small, intricate swirls of ginger. He was a man in every sense of the word, and Sherlock revelled in the certainty of that fact. He felt no inkling to experiment with other people; they were tedious, the lot of them. Sherlock had found John, the standard to which every other human male on the planet should be measured. And no one would ever measure up to John Watson in Sherlock’s eyes. No one.
John Watson is sent home as an invalid.
That this was a significant step in their friendship – maybe even an opened door to something new, beautiful – they both knew. And both didn't quite know how to react to that.
"I was shot," he explained, "and I think I need to get this wound cleaned." He tried to get up, but failed. "It just hurts so much." With a pained sigh he lay back down, accepting his fate that he would probably have to stay here forever.
moths. Why does John still
John signed with his hands, his eyes helplessly looking at Sherlock.
"Hey," he murmured, "John, don't go to sleep. Stay conscious. Please. The paramedics will be here soon, hang in there!"
He missed hearing the noises of his beloved London, the cars, the people, the birds. But most of all he missed the talks with Sherlock's, his deep baritone that usually pierced John's marrow and bone – and his violin playing.
That night, Sherlock couldn't sleep and he silently tip-toed to John's room where he gently knocked on the door. John stood beneath its frame, his hair mussed from sleep, and Sherlock remembered the time where he had compared John's every follicle to the grains of the beach. It made him unbearably sad, and it must have shown on his face for John took him into his arms and held him tightly, rocking them from side to side.
"When you are grown up," Mycroft said, "you will be allowed to rise up out of the ocean and learn about the human world, just like me."
But it is very deep.
he could hear again (most likely the cochlear nerve had recovered from the concussion) – the only thing that counted was
John knew Sherlock needed this quiet moment to collect himself and he was willing to give. He nudged Sherlock's nose gently with his own and let his hand fall from Sherlock's cheek to his neck, carding his fingers through the soft little curls at his nape. He touched his brow to Sherlock's again to have a third point of contact and to acquaint Sherlock slowly, softly and slowly, with touches. Sherlock's breath grew heavier and he closed his eyes for a short moment, before opening them again and looking at John. He looked so young, so vulnerable. He was starting to open up to John, completely committing himself to him, and this made John's heart beat faster. He smiled one last time before closing the little gap between them, slowly, slowly, and brushed his lips across Sherlock's.
John didn't know how much time had passed during which they sat opposite the other like this, touching only at their knees and the wrist. It could have been seconds, it could have been hours. Time didn't matter. What counted was Sherlock.
Anyway – we both know you would never kill me. SH
A small thing Sherlock hadn't calculated, just this one, tiny mistake – and this was the result.
Fortunately, John's head wound didn't need to be stitched up and he only required a bandage. All in all, the doctor made off lightly and was feeling much better after some hours of sleep during which Sherlock sat next to his bed.
John knew he had to give Sherlock time, he who had never had physical contact to anybody. He would give him time to learn and Sherlock would learn, he knew that.
They were a crazy pair but John couldn't have imagined a better life. He wasn't angry at Sherlock, just sad. Disappointed. His hearing had vanished for an apparently indefinite period of time and it still was unknown whether he would regain it. But he wouldn't be John Watson if he didn't look ahead in an upbeat mood. At some point, he told himself, he would be able to hear again. And he was sure that Sherlock would help him with that.
They even texted each other in the evenings – John couldn't watch his favourite shows, he didn't feel like reading most of the time and Sherlock was mainly bored. So one of them would whip out their mobile and start a conversation with the other. Surprisingly, it was Sherlock who made the first step most of the time. After a few weeks they even texted each other when John was already in bed. It was like a bedtime story when he communicated with Sherlock. It helped him to go to sleep for some reason.
he could hear again.
And this was the solution they needed: sign language.
since he was able to actually write something. They'd been extremely busy the last few weeks, but his readers wanted to be kept up-to-date. And what better way to spend a day off with doing just that? But apparently, Sherlock didn't think so.
While he was still thinking about what to do, John nudged his thigh with the edge of the notebook.
"But," John continued and placed a tender hand on Sherlock's, "I want you to play the violin at my wedding, for you play so beautifully that I can never get enough of it."
The only answer he gets is a frown.
John closed his eyes again, enjoying the tune. Sherlock didn't know how long they were on the shore, it could have been hours, it could have been seconds. Sherlock played and played, his fingers dancing quicker than ever, to make John feel better.
At least that was what John thought. Sherlock, though, was more than happy with their solution. He could talk to John; they had something connecting them. But he never told John. And therefore, John soon felt as useless as some months before.
John felt the music flowing through his fingers and into his veins, spreading through his body and massing in his heart – filling it with warmth and causing John to feel so overwhelmed that he had to let go of the bow, clutching at Sherlock's hip. Sherlock paused for a moment but continued playing, slower this time but still with so many emotions he had stored for months, years,
But Sherlock had to refuse, and it broke his heart even more to see John's disappointed look. They parted soon after in silence, each man departing on his own, and John heard Sherlock cry when he walked away.
He was an unusual child, quiet and reclusive, yet his mind and his intelligence were most remarkable. The young merman was very curious, too, and he took in everything he could— everything there was to learn. He experimented and examined everything there was to be found in Baker Kingdom, and it seemed like his head was never full and always hungry for new information.
He sulked against the wall, purposefully slouching, despite what the ballet masters had told him about his posture. He was still too tall for his age, his limbs too long and his hands too large. He felt like a freak in class, his extension uncontrolled and his spins too spastic to be beautiful despite their precision. Those were a few of the reasons he’d applied to the school, and reluctantly allowed the move to London. Needs must if he wanted to be the best, his mother had told him and he agreed.
“I don’t know what you mean.”
“Yes. Well, I’m a prat and you’re an asshole. Can we really blame us?”
,” John whispered through his teeth. His body tensed under the surprising new touch, the muscles of his thighs straining and the inward dip of his stomach going taught with his inhaled breath.
Sherlock swayed, his body losing its balance in the crowd and John held on tighter, laughing into the skin of his neck. “Whoa, there. Steady.”
“So?” John called over the loud cascades of rhythm he was forcing out of the piano’s depths.
“No, I don’t think I will.”
“Are you commanding me to open my door?”
“Oh, god.” John’s head tipped back, hitting the wall with a dull thud as Sherlock licked his way along the stubble of his jawline and found the lobe of his ear, biting down hard and eliciting a moan from John and a simultaneous jut of his hips. Sherlock answered back with a downward thrust of his own and the two of them groaned that the friction it created against their twin, aching and sudden erections.
John laughed. Sherlock had read his mind.
“That was rude, John.”
“Your celebrity has risen, yes.”
John bit his hip in response, chuckling against Sherlock’s stomach. The sensation caused goosebumps to spread out over his skin.
. Much like the genre of the musical score being referred to as
Part of her reasoning in asking young John to stay with her in her home was, hopefully, to move things along in that area. Yes, the man needed a place to stay that wasn’t a crummy, cramped room in a friend’s flat, but besides that, he needed affection, and Martha also thought a bit of a challenge, just like her other young houseguest. John was a puzzle waiting to be solved and Sherlock did always love a good puzzle.
. Desperately. It took him no less than three seconds to pull down John’s trousers and curl his fingers under the elastic of his pants to drag them past his hips, letting loose the erection he’d been aching to see since the first time he’d pressed himself against the man and felt it push hard and wanting into his upper thigh.
. . .
The boy stopped and turned, the rest of the group continuing around the corner at the end of the street. He lifted an eyebrow at Sherlock, a smirk clear on his face. It didn’t look cruel, however, and that startled Sherlock. Was he just being kind? Friendly? Flirtatious?
“My career? Not me?”
“It seems rather convenient to me that I’ve been followed by a small group of very dedicated photographers in very crisp bespoke suits for the past two and a half years running.”
The intricate black and white, patterned hexagonal tile leading to the foyer seemed to mock him as Sherlock walked barefoot towards the front stairwell with as much composure as his born-and-bred, blue British blood could muster. He told himself that the fact he was out of breath stemmed from spending too much time in the shock of the early morning heat and not the utter, unending frustration coursing through him on a constantly recycled circuit.
Needless to say, John did not sleep well, and at the first signs of sunrise cresting over the endless rows of tenements and brownstones John rose and may his way into work, the need to be in the studio overwhelming him.
“I got your text.”
“Because. I’m a helpless romantic and I like happy endings. Almost as much as I like seeing pretty boys kiss.” She winked, patted the pocket of her satchel where her phone sat, and pushed off the piano, striding to the front of the room to join Greg. John was left behind with a tepid cup of tea in his hands and an uneasy sense of companionship settling in his stomach. He was very much looking forward to the end the day and something stronger than tea to quell his nerves.
Returning home at half eleven, fueled by the smoky-sweet burn of his favorite Scotch still fresh on his lips, John pounded on the door of Sherlock’s room. His frustration over Sherlock’s odd behavior having melted into the tired edge of anger during his sobering walk home. They’d spent precious little time in each other’s company since their first night together due to rehearsal schedules and Sherlock’s bizarre sleeping habits, and the lack of time together in the interim days weighed heavily on John’s shoulders.
and would let nothing else in beside it.
“Okay?” He was asking permission one final time. Sherlock nodded and John didn’t hesitate, he pulled and exposed all of Sherlock to the warm, honey-thickened air of the room.
Thanks for sticking with me. Enjoy.
Sherlock watched as John greeted the other musicians with warm smiles for each. The trumpet player handed him a takeaway cup of what Sherlock assumed to be a strong brew of oolong with honey. The sight made Sherlock wince with its obvious kindness. Why hadn’t Sherlock thought of getting a cuppa for him? It was such a simple thing, such a genuine gesture of friendship. Why hadn’t he ever done that for John before?
The air felt tense in the studio. A little too tense to John considering that what had been interrupted was a fairly chaste foot massage, despite where Irene’s mind had taken the proceedings. They were all adults here and Irene had told John on more than one occasion to just ‘do it already’ in regards to Sherlock. It wasn’t as if she was against them being together.
What had he meant?
John nodded. “Yes.”
The dancers mention in this chapter are as follows:
. . . “ John repeated as he watched the studio door close behind the confounding woman. “What just happened?”
He smiled down at the impossible man and pulled off his shirt before stepping towards the bed. The familiar weight of his father’s dog tags slapped against his skin as they fell from being caught on the lip of his tee once he’d tugged it off his head. Sherlock opened his eyes just as the light glinted off the dull, aged silver. He had noticed them the night before, of course, and many times before that he’d spied the beaded chain along the back of John’s neck peeking out just above the collar of his shirt. He simply hadn’t had the time to pay attention to them before now.
John licked his lips. "Starving."
The idea to restage
A laugh puffed out against Sherlock’s hair. “What the hell are you thanking me for?”
“Your turn,” Sherlock said, voice overly eager. He smiled as he spoke the words against John’s lips, and felt John’s laughter puff out against his face in response.
“Just sometimes?”
“I ordered pizza for dinner. I do adore Brooklyn pizza. Hope you do too, John?”
Even though the air around them crackled with tension, Irene remained calm and continued to smile. “You think I’m going to tell Mycroft.” She spoke to Sherlock alone.
“No, you aren’t. Don’t forget that I was the one who helped you pick up the pieces after that disaster of a club night your friends dragged you to. Not only that, but I also have proof of your almost-
Now that Sherlock was allowing himself this moment, allowing himself to be governed by his instincts as opposed to his mind, he wanted to savour it, to process as much of the overwhelming amounts of information he could as he explored and experienced another man’s body for the first time.
No matter the catalyst, this wasn’t the first time they’d sat side by side with music on their minds and instruments at hand. Sherlock had found a joy in sharing something so essential to John’s existence over the past year, and playing with him had become a cherished routine that Sherlock now often craved.
There! That's a more hopeful ending to a chapter, right?
The man in John’s arms was all muscle and sinew and long, endless limbs of pale, white skin. It was intoxicating to have him this close, and holding on so tight after all those weeks of questioning looks and endlessly frustrating tension. John leaned in and licked a stripe along Sherlock’s collarbone, tasting the salt of his skin and breathing in the scent of him, inhaling deeply, losing himself. Sherlock’s head tipped forward, his damp hair falling over John’s forehead as Sherlock nuzzled against his ear, his lips tentative and shy against his skin.
“Bonne chance, gaitanet.”
“I feel like I’m burning.”
John’s statement fell on deaf ears as Sherlock took the man in, enjoying the unique view from the vantage point of the carpet. John's shirt was hanging open, exposing his tan torso. Sherlock licked his lips.
“So, what did you do to poor Sherlock?”
Mycroft curled his lip at his younger brother. “Quite the opposite, in fact.”
of his spine cracking, feeling listless and languid in the hazy summer heat. The breeze coming from the third-floor windows was humid and heavy and quintessentially familiar yet foreign—it couldn’t remember it ever being this hot in Britain.
John’s hands came up to rest on either side of Sherlock’s face, his thumbs running over the sharp crest of his cheekbones. “We need to stop.”
Sherlock scoffed, “human beauty is a construct, John.”
(See the end of the chapter for
"Sherlock, be kind." Siobhan took a sip of tea, her eyes sharp despite the softness of her tone. Sherlock gave her wrist a slight squeeze of affection before retiring his hands to his own lap.
“Do hurry and get to your idiotic point, brother mine. The tea is getting cold.”
GHB or Liquid Fantasy or Liquid E is a common club drug that loosens inhibitions and makes you rather randy. It's also very dangerous to mix with alcohol (what isn't?) and both Irene and Sherlock failed to factor in the amount he'd already drunk at the time she'd slipped him her little 'helping hand' pill. Thank you to Tali-Zora (who works in the medical field) for helping me with research and being on hand for all my drug-related questions. :)
Sherlock could feel the piece coming to an end, and listened as John played two chords over and over again, teasing them out into softer and softer beats, dancing between two fingers. Sherlock drifted towards the gentle sound, chasing the last vestiges of his self-control along with the dwindling music. He leaned in down over John’s back to watch his left hand play out the final notes, his arm resting over top of the piano with his free hand balled into a fist at his side to keep from touching John along the point of hair at the back of his neck like he’d done all those weeks ago. Now, he wanted to nuzzle his nose into that same spot and drag his tongue up along the back of John’s ear to taste the hidden skin, Mycroft be damned.
The audience roared with applause and Sherlock grinned, breaking away to return John's wink before turning towards his fellow dancers and rejoining their ranks. John somehow managed to keep playing a syncopated beat on the keys, maintaining a rhythm for them to move by, and the final piece played on with a new level of added intensity present in the choreography. That kiss had spurred something in the dancers, sparking a hormone-laced frenzy that ignited the movement beyond the telling of a story, to the burning of an eternal feeling of youth and love and freedom. Sherlock finally knew what Mrs H had meant; this was the feeling she’d told them to seek out. His body sung with its presence in his veins.
John turned his head towards the shared wall with the man who no longer felt it necessary to acknowledge John’s presence, the conversation from earlier in the evening notwithstanding, and he crumbled a little at the thought. The dream-memory he’d just experienced left him with a strange, unbalanced equilibrium - a feeling of being slightly off-kilter in the world. He staggered from the bed, suddenly parched and in need of a drink. He threw open the bedroom door and made his way down the stairs towards where he hoped a kitchen would be on the first floor.
They wrote each other little notes in the beginning. They couldn't communicate in any other way apart from tiny gestures and expressions. So they restricted themselves to written correspondence, either with little slips of paper or their mobiles – the latter being preferred by Sherlock.
John was quiet at first, silence stretching out between them like an unwelcome guest and then he heaved a sigh. "I do. Sherlock, God help me, I do. But I am to wed Mary, the daughter of the king here, and there is nothing I can do about it."
Eventually, Sherlock let John take control again, his arousal very visible when John let his gaze roam over him. Sherlock was shy and John didn't want him to feel uncomfortable at this next step. He kissed him on the mouth, intertwining one hand with Sherlock's while pulling his pants off and doing the same to Sherlock. Sherlock's eyes were closed and he breathed heavily into John's mouth, tugging his lips over John's without really applying pressure. He was too distracted by all the sensations pouring down on him.
“Has anyone ever told you, Mrs Hudson, that you have impeccable timing?”
. . .
It was a whisper. A confession. A plea. Spoken down to the piano’s keys, as if the caress of the word would ricochet and reach out to the man behind him.
“You’ve been successful. There’s pride in that.”
A reality in which John Watson was happy.
John’s hands ran down Sherlock’s back before teasing back up his spine and twisting tightly into his curls. He tugged, guiding Sherlock’s mouth where he wanted. “Nibble my ear,” John said, voice rough. Sherlock grinned, licking a stripe along the shell of his ear.
John shrugged and sat down.
Sherlock hummed to himself and walked further into the room, his hands clasped behind his back. Just in front of him were two five-paneled, dark wood doors on either side of a fireplace with an ornate marble mantel and carved wooden hearth surround. Sherlock picked the door on the right, pulling it open with an exaggerated flourish - being cordial was one thing, but it seemed that Sherlock Holmes could not help being a dramatic git no matter what circumstance. John moved past him with a small nod of
“Oh, really?”
“My dear boy, you naughty thing! Congratulations. I do believe I owe you a slightly larger salary now that you’re apart of the
John laughed. “Christ, I think Molly would die if you kissed her like the way you kissed me this morning.”
She looked shocked. “No. He would never.”
Sherlock hummed and picked up the tags as John played with a lock of his wild, tangled hair. The two of them were magnetized towards each other, John lying higher up on the pillow, his left arm supporting his head while Sherlock rested in the space beside him looking upwards towards the ceiling, long fingers cradling the silver tags with interest.
John nodded, satisfied that the woman was probably taking the piss a bit but her intentions seemed to be in the right place. He lapped at the condensation collecting along his glass and sipped his drink, marveling once again at the rabbit hole he must have fallen down to end up in such a place with such a landlady.
It was Molly. The second they locked eyes, he knew that words were not needed. She looked back and forth between him and John with wizened eyes and Sherlock saw the correct conclusion come to her within moments. Molly had always been smarter than Sherlock had ever given her credit for and another notch of guilt etched itself into his skin at the thought.
Mr Baynes’ left eyebrow arched elegantly into the silver hair sweeping his forehead. “You certainly have a decided opinion on the matter.”
“Kiss me,” he demanded as he crawled up John’s body, greedy and wanting.
Mycroft remained silent, Sherlock continued. "You planned all this, didn't you?"
“Itsfine,” Sherlock slurred, and reached for the car door, his fingers slipping against the handle. John stepped in close and opened the door, asking the driver if he was here to pick up a John Watson and the man nodded. John was too keyed up about Sherlock to care and turned to help him and Molly into the backseat.
“John, dear. You’re home.” She kissed him on each cheek and squeezed his elbow, tugging one of two rucksacks from his shoulder and placing it pointedly at Sherlock’s bare feet. “How was it finding the place? Not hard, I hope.”
That night proved to be more of a disaster than John originally thought, considering Sherlock’s reaction to him when the company resumed work on Tuesday. Or, his lack of reaction. The man burst into the studio with all the fury and defiance of a soldier entering enemy territory, his aristocratic nose was high in the air and his razor-edged wit sharp on his tongue. He spoke to no one that day other than to insult them, and even snapped at Mrs H for taking too long to explain an adagio sequence, to the astonishment of the entire class. Mrs H smiled at him, declared that his behavior was suspect, and told him to take a ‘fresh air’ break, to which he rolled his eyes. She clapped her hands to get his attention, held his gaze, and within five seconds Sherlock was turning on his heel and heading out the door.
And then Mr Bayens’ brilliant idea for the final piece of the production lit up the theater with its inspirational allure and all Sherlock could do was bite hard on his bottom lip to keep a cry of bitter laughter at bay. He felt Molly’s delicate hand wrap its way around his forearm, and he looked down at her as Mrs H cheered on in the background. Molly smiled up at him, the compassionate look in her eyes blatant with understanding. Sherlock tucked his chin in a tight nod of appreciation and mouthed a silent
The morning after opening night found Sherlock staring blindly at the plaster ceiling above him, eyes unfocused, thoughts racing. He had not slept, his mind never ceasing in its insistent review of the evening’s performance and the events that followed. He couldn't stop assessing where things had gone right, where they’d gone wrong, variables that couldn’t be controlled vs. the inevitable hiccups that came with the first night of any production.
Sherlock grinned back, satisfied. “Then why should I bother if you didn’t?”
“You’re serious?”
*Merde - literally means 'shit' in French. It's a tradition that all ballet dancers tell each other Merde before heading onto the stage. It's their way of wishing each other luck for the performance.
“I got your text.” He said, louder this time.
. . .
“For staying.”
“Interesting,” he said to the air, looking at the space where the boy had been. He felt bereft of an opportunity though he couldn’t fathom why since friendship had never been on Sherlock’s radar.
John snapped, throwing his hands in the air. “To fuck your life up, I guess!” and then sagged with exhaustion. “Why are you doing this?”
Sherlock swallowed, John watched the bob of his Adam’s apple descend in his throat and willed himself to not lean in and lick at the delicate skin.
Ascending the stairs with hesitant steps so as to not spill, John felt a childlike giddiness threaten to overtake him from the inside out, causing him to pause mid-way and force his face into a mask of stiff-upper-lip English calm. It didn’t last. Another two steps and he felt as if he was radiating as much light from his skin as the sun produced in the noon-day sky. He wanted to hum, to sing, to shout out towards the rooftops that Sherlock Holmes was lying in his bed, exhausted and sated thanks to John and John alone.
“Amazing,” John said, staring openly at the man.
“John,” he said, sad and small. The sound echoed softly in the room and then dissipated into the silence of the house. Sherlock had never felt more alone.
“But you can kiss,” John said, his mind latching on to the most trivial of thoughts. He knew full well that Sherlock’s tongue had talents beyond that of a novice.
Mycroft straightened his tie, his forehead boasting a sheen that hadn’t been there several minutes prior.
John Watson had never been more keyed-up in all his thirty-two years of life and he knew, without a doubt in his mind, that Sherlock Holmes was in the same exact state. No matter how Sherlock presented himself with his cool, collected nature and acerbic attitude on the surface, John had felt the simmering heat of his skin against his the other night, even if it was only through the pads of his fingertips in his sweat-slicked hair. John knew - he knew Sherlock was just as twisted up in this web of neverending frustration as he was. What he didn’t understand was, why Sherlock kept denying himself. Why was Sherlock Holmes hiding?
John blinked, refocusing. “Your feet. You mean . . . you want me to give you a foot massage?”
“What the hell are you even saying? Go!”
The name was a warning, but rather than trigger caution within him, all it did was make his skin prickle with alert attention, his heart rate spiking at the implications in the edge of John’s voice.
At the beginning of September in Sherlock’s fifth year with The Royal Ballet and third year of his tenure as their ‘Golden Boy of Ballet’, things finally fell apart. He would later associate the constant simmering anger he felt running through him with the early death of his father, but at the time, he did his best to not dwell on the pain and instead focused all of his emotion into his dancing.
When John approached him at the end of class to ask how he faired after he’d left him on Friday night, Sherlock glared at him, eyes blazing and face cool. He said nothing to John, and turned back to his bag, shoving his empty water bottle and a pair of leg warmers into its depths. John scratched at his neck, hovering awkwardly over him, wishing he’d speak.
“Hudders thought you’d want to practice your music while here,” Sherlock drawled when he saw the look of amazement on John’s face. John was so taken with the piano, he let the slightly disturbing endearment of
“Being a musician, and a traveling one at that, isn’t exactly something my father was proud of, no.”
“So this is a music room. Brilliant.”
Despite the rush of feeling Sherlock was currently riding, it did not escape his notice that John refused to look up from his pages as he played. He curved in on himself over the piano, his shoulders hunching and shifting with tension as he pounded the keys into submission. The audience must have been torn between watching the dancers dominate the stage, bringing Jerome Robbins’ choreography to life with perfect precision, and the way with which John Watson made those piano keys bend to his will. Sherlock couldn’t keep his eyes off him, which was not ideal considering he needed to concentrate.
Sherlock slumped and curled himself around John with one long leg draped over his lap and an arm thrown over his chest as if John were a very large personal Sherlock pillow. Molly couldn’t help but chuckle at the affectionate mess Sherlock had made of the two of them, and John rolled her eyes at her.
The image was doused in the heavily contrasting blues and purples of the club’s lights, the sweat on their skin glowing in the harsh colors. The bodies thrashing around them were blurred, leaving him and Sherlock the sole focus of the camera’s gaze as if they were under a spotlight illuminating every grind, every thrust, every bite of their mouths. It was a striking photo, and a damning one.
made John’s fingers twitch with excitement. Playing classical adagios every day did wear on a person, some diversity was needed, after all. At least as far as John was concerned.
“You need something to eat, dear?”
“Oh, god.” They were the only words John seemed to be able to say.
Sherlock nodded along with his fellow dancers, suspecting that her little pep-talk was aimed at him in particular. He stole a glance sideways to where John sat behind the practice piano on stage left, his true expression hidden behind a polite smile. Sherlock willed him to find his gaze, and by some miracle, John did, his storm-blue eyes locking with Sherlock’s as Mrs H urged them all to be bold and not to shy away from all those raw, messy emotions because where there's pain, there's also beauty. She ended by giving praise to Jerome Robbins himself, and the pure freedom and celebration of youth his choreography encapsulated.
Although the distance between the boat and Sherlock wasn't too large, he couldn't hear what they were saying. The clash of the waves and the screaming of the gulls nearby made it impossible to hear what they talked about.
, I mean
John kissed him again and noticed Sherlock swallowing heavily. The detective took his violin and bow into one hand and turned around without escaping John's embrace. He wrapped his arms around the doctor's shoulders and together they held each other, both overwhelmed by the rush of emotions running through them.
The moment John woke up and looked at Sherlock for the first time was probably one of the worst moments in the life of the Consulting Detective. The happiness about his blogger being more or less well again was dimmed by his frightened, almost panic-stricken look – an expression Sherlock didn't know from John. John still couldn't hear anything. And he knew it. As both doctor and former soldier, John mainly relied on his hearing. It was like eyesight for Sherlock. Hearing was a valuable bodily function that one usually took for granted, but as soon as one couldn't use it anymore, one's world was turned upsidedown.
The following smile on both sides didn't require a new hand sign.
He looks up at his flatmate who is smiling warmly, his eyes sparkling gently as he looks at his best friend. Sherlock smiles back, and after a bit of thought he adds,
It became a habit that they were texting each other all day long. While Sherlock consented to do the shopping at Tesco's and actually
“The point
They went to sleep in a tight embrace, content and happy.
Sherlock smiled, trying to ignore the pain that still took hold of his legs and walked closer to John. "I am glad to finally see you again," he admitted, taking in the beauty of the young man before him.
Relief.
Sherlock averted his gaze, saying nothing.
Sherlock, who was struggling against physical intimacy like a cat against water, whose heart was racing while holding John in his arms like this, who continuously asked himself whether he would always be of importance to the doctor.
“Don't be daft,” Sherlock scolds him, and gestures for John to join him on the sofa. “I would like to talk to you.”
John kissed Sherlock's brow, his eyelids, his nose, his cheeks, his mouth. He kissed him right below the ear, eliciting a soft moan. He kissed his jaw, let his lips trail along Sherlock's neck, nipped at his earlobe, turned to his collar bones.
He does comment on John's style of writing often, criticising that he makes the adventures sound
This realisation hit him with an unexpected force. John who usually was so strong and brave was now looking like a picture of misery – because of completely understandable reasons. Something in Sherlock told him that he wanted to soothe his friend in some way yet he didn't know how. Would John accept a touch now anyway or would he dismiss it as unwanted pity?
"He is up there," Sherlock thought, "he whom I love more than my parents and myself, he who occupies every corner of my head, and in whose hands I would willingly put my life."
I am apologising in advance for everything I am going to write. SH
John, who knew about his feelings towards Sherlock and still hated himself for being useless and deaf.
He smiled, and together they swam down to Baker Kingdom.
Sherlock started playing a piece he had composed himself – the one that John had loved so much when he played it to him for the first time. John curtly shifted behind him, an unmistakable sign that he recognised this piece. Unconsciously, John pressed closer to Sherlock to feel the music better. Sherlock's heartbeat quickened.
"Morning," he greeted him and kissed him softly on the forehead. He then crawled over him to his side and turned so they could face each other.
“Yes. Fine.
He slowly and thoughtfully climbed the stairs to John's room. As soon as he entered through the door, he'd walk across a thin rope. It would either break and destroy his friendship with John, or it would bring him into a world he had never experienced before. A world full of love and affection, full of happiness and hope.
John scoffs. “Different.
And then Sherlock's mouth was on his again, always soft but a bit more passionate this time. Sherlock almost kissed him with his whole body. Sherlock's hand that used to clutch John's hand, eased its grip and wrapped around the doctor's hips while the other wandered down to his chest and gently pushed him backwards.
Sherlock made a dismissing gesture. “I looked at my phone and it told me it was Valentine's Day but that’s not the
"Damn!" Sherlock let his fist ram onto the ground next to John's shoulder. The explosion hadn't only caused a head wound (he had stopped the bleeding with a makeshift bandage) but because of this extreme pressure, John was now … deaf. It wasn't the tinnitus an explosion usually caused, no. John couldn't understand Sherlock and he wouldn't lie to him. "You idiot," Sherlock cursed himself, tugging at his hair violently and screaming in agony. How could he have been so stupid and forget the bomb? Why hadn't he thought of this? It was his fault that John couldn't hear him anymore and he hated himself for this.
The village was still sleepy when John and Sherlock made their way to the shore where Sherlock went into the water that was shining under the sun and the waves lapped around his legs. The pain suddenly disappeared and a tail appeared where his legs used to be.
John moaned and jolted Sherlock out of his thoughts. The Consulting Detective framed John's face with his hands and gently moved the doctor's head from one side to the other.
Finally, he took Sherlock's hand and followed him to the window.
One evening on the fifteenth day, John and Sherlock were sat on the shore side by side, looking at the water in front of them.
His hands roamed over Sherlock's chest, slow and exploring, caressing him, pushing the shirt off his body. John pushed it over his shoulders, kissed the newly freed skin, every single inch. His fingers explored every dip, every muscle, every scar. Beneath him, Sherlock shivered due to all the new sensations.
