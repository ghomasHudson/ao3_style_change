It was always in the small hours of the morning that John would be stirred from his slumber by the faint smell of tobacco. The two men had fallen into a regular routine of sitting on the porch together at night to admire the stars. And of course, the blonde would always provide them with their tea. Despite the regular interruptions of John’s sleep patterns, he much preferred this to his repeated night terrors. Although he still dreamt of his sister, they were becoming less frequent these days. His constant fears were being soothed away by Sherlock’s stern yet nurturing attitude. John had been able to find some kind of solace in their partnership and it suited him just fine.
But John’s fear and doubt were both suddenly erased when the memory of Sherlock’s face came into focus in his mind. He thought of the way the taller man would look at him with such adoration and pride, the way in which he would purposefully, but discreetly brush his fingers against those of his own, the way he cared for and nurtured him with such patience. And then that look of lust in those silvery blue orbs – they felt like both a wonderful dream and a twisted nightmare.
“Sister!”, he exclaimed, raising a clenched fist to his mouth in frustration. John however was blown away. He had never breathed so much as a word about himself to anyone, not even Molly. He was about to enquire as to how the dark haired man knew so much about him when the
Sholto let out a tired sigh, rubbing the side of his face in exasperation. John giggled at this, causing the taller man to blush yet again. “I better go…”, he mumbled, reluctance dripping from every inch of him. “But I’ll see you soon?”
“Sorry?” Sherlock began to think that maybe this man wasn’t as predictable as he originally thought.
The other man in question was sat facing the opposite direction onto the street, puffing away on his
John arched his neck to see who she was talking to, but he already knew who was stood close behind him. Sherlock however had been keeping him eyes focused on the distance, as if still staring after Sholto. “I know a good
“No stop wait!”, John rushed, the blush on his face growing more by the minute. The very thought of spitting on his own erection in front of the man he had wanted for so long only served to cause his cheeks to become more red. Nevertheless, he strained his neck forwards as much as he possibly could, gathering as much saliva in his mouth as he could muster. However he faltered when he made the mistake of chancing a glimpse at the other man’s face, to which he was met with an expression of both wonder and lust. He must’ve visibly hesitated as Sherlock sulkily huffed when their eyes made contact. “For goodness sake John, am I going to have to make you spit for me?” His fingers were then immediately pressed on either side of John’s cheeks, forcing his lips into an awkward shape. The smell of his own musk on Sherlock’s fingers made him crinkle his nose and squeeze his eyes shut in embarrassment. He attempted to shake his head loose of Sherlock’s hold, but the detective was having none of it. That was until a long thick line of drool fell from John’s contorted lips and pooled his chest.
A look of minor annoyance appeared on Mycroft's face. He glanced at Anthea to which she nodded. She lifted herself from her knees to retreat backwards to the
“Hey, I said wait!” And with that, John reached out to tear away the cloth that hid his opponent’s face to reveal yet another person he swore he had met before. She threw him a blisteringly angry look of pure hatred, spitting a globule of blood at him in spite. The blonde just stared in shock and confusion. Furrowing his brow, he pondered.
, shaking the blood off of their weapon to leave a splatter directly in front of them. This time John did flinch, clenching his fists in response when his opponent lifted their sword to point directly at him.
"I'll grab my coat" And with that, he exited the room, heading for that of his own. Lestrade sighed, pinching the middle of his eyebrows in exasperation.
Anthea clenched her jaw, unsure of how to respond. The man looked haggard: he was sporting a messy stubble and his greasy dark curls had been pulled back into a bun. She then realised their visitor had been holding out his hat to which she shot a glare at the servants behind him, angrily snapping her fingers. Molly took it upon herself to be the one to step forwards, attempting to carefully balance their guest’s sack of belongings under one arm as she reached out to take their visitor’s hat. Molly made sure to bow simultaneously and avert her eyes.
that swooped around him, in and out of the room. They had all been tasked with the sole purpose of getting him ready for his performance, but the blonde’s mind was drifting elsewhere. A timid looking woman knelt in front of him to readjust the collar of his kimono, avoiding his eyes as she did so. Having failed to get her attention, he grabbed onto her sleeve. “Where is he?” He inquired with urgency, but the
The vague nature of the other man's words began to get on John's nerves. Letting out a shout of anger, he threw out a leg intended to connected with Sherlock's side. But he had acted out in rage, miscalculating his stance as the other man easily caught his leg. Pulling him forwards with twist, John fell with a yelp, throwing out his hands in a vain attempt to soften his fall as his head connected with the ground. He groaned, reaching out to grab his
“Sher-Sherlock,” he grumbled against the other man’s chest, struggling to grip onto the sleeves of his
Molly shook her head, "but at some point, they might." John frowned at the thought, concern marking his features; he worried what the consequences might be. So lost in his thoughts he was, he didn't register Molly holding out a leather pouch. He snapped himself out of his thoughts, gratefully accepting the offer and took a generous gulp of water.
This time, John woke with a start. He gasped as he shot upwards from the bed, a couple of beads of sweat appearing on his brow. Registering a dull ache in his arm, he glanced down to notice that his wound had been neatly wrapped in a bandage. Then the smell of ginger hit his nostrils.
and headed over to the pot of tea back where he was originally sat. John let out a sigh of relief, allowing his eyes to momentarily close. When he opened them again, a small cup was being offered to him, right under his nose. He nearly jumped from yet another breach of his personal space.
"Hmph". He took a long drag from his cigarette, holding his gaze with the floor. The doctor felt compelled to stay as still as possible.
into his room. “Get yourself freshened up. I’ll be outside. Ten minutes.” And with that, he disappeared.
to the garden: it was Sherlock. A pure sensation of relief poured through the blonde’s body with a small part of him wanting to touch the other man so as to reassure himself that he was definitely there, safe and sound, and in one piece. He just about registered the inquisitive look on the taller man’s face as he pushed himself off of the door frame to cross to his room next door via the porch.
fan. John eventually fixed his gaze on the stewing pot of tea that sat in the middle of the three of them, silently brewing away. He considered offering them a drink when the
Mother shot the guest a dangerous look, “This isn’t just a whore house, Sherlock. It’s more than that and you know it.” And with that he turned, “Come now, let’s get you freshened up and presentable for a change. I fear you might stink out the entire city!” Mother Mycroft began to saunter back the way he came, with his brother Sherlock following behind. Anthea was quick to follow, with Molly and the other servant behind her, struggling to carry Sherlock’s many belongings. Molly took the opportunity to steal a look at all the servants’ faces, scanning for John’s own, but he was nowhere to be seen. When they all reached the door at the opposite end of the entrance to the courtyard, Mycroft caught Anthea’s eyes and gave her a small nod. She turned and ushered Molly and the second servant away, opened the
“Keep your hand here.” Sherlock near growled into John’s ear. The blonde tried to nod; keeping his hand in place on top of the

loose, causing it to slide and fall. It landed with a loud crash on the street below, just as John had fisted Sherlock's
“Not hungry.” And with that, he placed the pipe in his mouth and began puffing away. He then took a long drag and soon after, produced a large cloud of smoke. When he turned to look at John, he noticed the
"I'm sorry, John." He near whispered, thumbing the sweat off of the smaller man's brow. "Just try to get some rest. I'll be right here."
“And who’s this pretty little blossom?” She stalked over to the blonde who was unsure of where to look. He felt as if he was prey being sized up by his predator.
It suddenly dawned on him that he had originally come downstairs to use the bathroom and that his bladder was now feeling uncomfortably full. "Don't-", John managed, before the hand was shoved into his boxers, grabbing onto John's limp member. As if snapped out of a trance, he suddenly thrashed out of Sherlock's grip, twisting away and throwing back an elbow. The dark haired man dodged the blow intended to connect with his sternum, but he wasn't fast enough to avoid it from hitting him in the side of the ribs. However he did not falter nor hesitate to land a punch into John's stomach, growling as he did so and consequently winding him in the process. John's eyes widened as he clutched at his gut, more from shock than pain. He didn't notice Sherlock take a couple of slow steps back.
John sat for a moment longer, staring at the dark figure beside him before pushing himself up to head back inside.
John was starting to lose his patience. “I mean why did she keep looking at me like that? And why did she keep looking at you like-“
John held himself for another moment longer before allowing himself to collapse. The cool stone floor against his skin made for a useful distraction from the awful stinging the bamboo had caused. He gasped the air back into his lungs before forcing himself to breathe more calmly through his nose. Shakily pushing himself off of the ground, he grunted as he stood, taking a couple of steps towards the stick he was mercilessly struck with moments before. Bending down to pick it up, he hissed as his back ached at the movement. Grabbing the stick off the harsh cold floor, he hobbled away to the wash rooms to clean the blood off the bamboo.
Sherlock cut him off. “Irene is one of the best, if not the best. Just be grateful that she is allowing you to attend tonight as a
remained perfectly still despite the indignant look on both their faces. Mycroft let out a loud sigh. The entire room had exploded in a vast array of emotion upon hearing Sherlock’s decision.
John almost jumped at the sound of Sherlock’s voice. He span around in an attempt to pinpoint the location of the other man, but it was too dark to see. That was until he both heard and saw him light a match, the dark haired man’s face framed in the brightness of the flame. Using it to smoke his
hurriedly picked his attacker from off of the floor to drag them away. “Wait!” Pushing past Sherlock, he made for the group.
John was vaguely aware a few moments later that Irene had now joined him on stage in an attempt to both thank and settle the awe struck crowd. But for the blonde, everything blended together into a sensory overload of a blur. One thing he was acutely aware of however was when his teacher rose abruptly from his chair, eyes fixed on something in the audience. He wanted to call out his name or at the very least, follow his line of sight into the crowd. Who was he looking at? What had he seen? But the blonde was already being dragged off stage by the same group of beautifully dressed
“Ok you know the drill, Watson. Out in the yard right now, robe off.”, he threw a thumb over his shoulder and John scurried away. Lestrade snapped round to Molly before seeing to John. “And you,” he pointed, “next time you catch a servant nodding off, you come find me. Understood?”
that laid at his feet. He darted his tongue out to wet his lips as a tense moment passed, the two of them holding each other eyes in an attempt to second guess the other man's next move.
“Yes please.” And with that, he turned to shout at his boisterous friends who laughed in response as they began their dissent into the night. Sholto briefly turned to steal another look at John who sweetly smiled and waved at the other man as he disappeared down the street. The apprentice let out a small happy sigh, nearly jumping when he felt a firm hand clasp onto one of his shoulders.
Sherlock blinked. “Why yes, I believe that bath is for me.” He pointed at the tub of hot water, John following his line of sight. When he turned his head back round, the man had stepped into the room and began to slide the
He couldn’t however stop himself from expressing his general annoyance. “I was beginning to think you’d sold me to Irene and left me here for good.” His lips formed a tight line as his body tensed. He could feel the other man’s eyes watching him with such burning intensity; it would’ve made him squirm.
“Your training starts tomorrow.” John looked up and was met with a stern look in Sherlock’s eyes. Fluttering his eyelashes nervously, he nodded his assent. The other man continued, “I expect you to be awake at dawn and presentable shortly after.” He set the cup down on the table and casually flopped backwards onto his bed.
“I won’t get caught”. Molly blinked rapidly, confusion flooding her face. She let out an exasperated sigh and resigned to letting John go. Before she turned to pick up her lamp to go back to her own room, she jabbed John in the arm.
“He can’t be serious!”, Lestrade continued, firmly placing his hands on his hips. He spun round to Mycroft, “Mother, you can’t allow this.” He waited for a response, but Mycroft’s eyes were closed in contemplation. “You simply can’t.” He waited again for a reply, but none came. “It’s ludicrous!”
I have ever had the pleasure of meeting.” And with that, he headed inside with John scurrying after him.
“Oof!” There was a loud crash as John’s ramen bowl was knocked from the table, hitting the floor and smashing into tiny pieces. The hooded figure had collided with full force into the two of them, nearly knocking them both off their stools.
. He raised an eyebrow at a confused looking John, which he took as permission to speak. “Who is that?”
“Yes, he’s been rather good. I was expecting less of you, brother, but it would appear I am mistaken. Your servants are rather impressive indeed.” He flashed a smile at John, eliciting an awkward squirm from him in response.
He realised he had a point. Scrambling off of the other man, he looked away to bury his head in his hands. "I'm sorry, I just thought-"
Something was wrong. John didn’t feel quite right. The room began to spin slightly and his vision was a little blurred. He frowned at the now empty cup, throwing the same look at Sherlock, but the minor movement of turning his head nearly sent him tumbling backwards. His teacher was there to catch him before he crumpled into a messy heap on the floor. “It’s okay, I’ve got you.” He spoke softly into John’s ear.
Then suddenly John was on him, nearly toppling them both off the roof. The force of the sudden movement knocked one of the many
The taller man realigned his eyes with John’s now smiling face. The blonde shook his head at the floor in disbelief, chuckling to himself, more in surprise than amusement. Sherlock frowned as he asked, “Did I get it all right?”
brought the whirlwind in the room to a halt. John spun his head around, much like everyone else. There stood in the doorway was Sherlock, casually leaning against the door frame with the string instrument cradled in his arms. He snapped his fingers at them all, causing everyone to shuffle as quickly as they could out of the room, their heads bowed as they passed the tall man in the doorway. Everyone disappeared except for John who remained perfectly still where he was knelt in front of the dressing mirror.
John was having a nightmare and this time it was double the intensity of his previous dreams. He thrashed and writhed in his bed, the sheets tangled just below his waist. Every inch of him was covered in a thin line of sweat as he mumbled and groaned. A cascade of images flooded his mind in a fast-paced flurry. His sister was stood in front of him, as she always was, but this time it was as if her entire being was being ripped away and dispersed into the ether. John tried to scream, but couldn’t. Instead he felt as if he was suffocating as panic started to brew away within him. Then he was falling and falling and falling – it never seemed to end. A series of unintelligible shouts and cries drowned his ears and surrounded his entire being. He felt consumed, frozen and terrified. The rush of wind grew louder and louder, as if he were falling faster with every second that passed. Any minute now he’d hit the ground, but just before he did he heard a faint whisper. “John…”, but it wasn’t Harry, it was-
The two had been walking through the many gardens for what felt like hours. The previous awkwardness of their initial meeting from just moments before had completely melted away and now they had found themselves strolling arm in arm at a comfortable pace, occasionally holding each others gaze. Sholto had been recounting many tales to John to his fascination, encouraging him to continue on and on. Occasionally the blonde would giggle when the taller of the two would tell him of his more amusing anecdotes. The only thing that remained from their first encounter was a shared blush.
Sherlock and Irene debated endlessly over the finer points of tea ceremonies for what felt like hours. John however was struggling to keep his eyes open. He drifted back to admiring one of the many gardens of Irene’s House. He was grateful that they had decided to leave the
“What…?” And then Sherlock sat with his legs on either side of John. The blonde nearly leapt from the unexpected physical contact, attempting to shrink his body away from that of Sherlock’s. “…are you doing?!” The smaller man almost squeaked. He froze when he felt the other man’s hands take those of his own, pushing them forwards and onto the awaiting
The blonde felt those reassuring protective arms that were wrapped around him squeeze a little tighter in response to those words. Further exchange ensued, only this time it was hushed and hissed. John’s head began doing summersaults again; tentatively he managed to clasp onto one of Sherlock’s sleeves, wanting to grab the other’s man attention, but before he could do so, he passed out.
sandals were caked in mud and his hands were wrapped in old bandages. Even Lestrade quirked an eyebrow at their unkempt visitor. There was a tense silence as everyone stood frozen on the spot. All that could be heard was the distant chirping of songbirds.
John thought. Sherlock then indicated to the lower half of the blonde’s body, “What about the rest of you then?”
, he pondered. Just as the thought had entered his mind, Sherlock turned to focus his gaze on him, almost as if he’d heard John thinking. Again, the blonde felt uncomfortable with the sudden attention, conjuring everything he could not to wriggle under the other man’s intense stare. A small smile formed on Sherlock’s lips, “Did you brew this yourself?”
The smaller man blinked before realising that Sherlock was referring to the razor. Keeping a careful eye on the ominous man in the tub, John padded softly across the room to place the razor by the mirror before sharply turning to head out the way he came. Sherlock however had been listening to his footsteps, lifting a corner of the flannel to peer at the blonde as he made for the door. He calmly placed it back on his face as he spoke, “I don’t recall mentioning that you were dismissed.”
The dark haired man opened his mouth with the intention of revealing all, keen to impress the other man with a cascade of fast paced words to form his brilliant explanation. But John wasn’t interested in the why, he was interested in the:
The blonde didn't know how to respond. He fluttered his eyelids before darting out his tongue to wet his lips.
“Uh yes um sorry.” He delicately took the cup from his teacher’s hands, their fingers brushing slightly. John bowed his head a little and took a sip.
The dark haired man fondly traced one of his thumbs over the blonde’s cheek in a sweet caress. That pull John was experiencing was growing stronger and stronger; he wanted to be as close to the other man as physically possible, but he remained put. Both of them appeared to be lost in each other, enjoying a new level of intimacy they had never explored together before. The smaller of the two nervously darted out his tongue to wet his lips whilst subconsciously flicking his eyes downwards to admire the beautifully angular curves of Sherlock’s mouth. When he realigned with gaze with the other man’s eyes, he just about caught him glancing down at John’s own mouth also. An unspoken realisation was close to descending upon the room when the door was thrown open with a loud bang causing them both to jump away from each other. Whatever spell they were under had been abruptly broken.
propped up against a nearby wall. It would have to do. Heading for the only weapon he could find, he slid up to them, grabbing them so as to swivel and jab his opponent in the gut. They gasped and coughed loudly as they stumbled back, clutching at their chest. John couldn’t help the fleeting feeling of victory bounce around inside him for having successfully winded his attacker. But his fear was almost immediately renewed upon hearing what sounded like a growl emanate from the figure in front of him. And then they were locked in battle once more with the blonde still having to duck away from the onslaught of swipes and strikes; he knew their blade was sharp enough to cut through the bamboo of his
“Brother! Where on earth have you been? For a minute, I thought you’d finally packed up and left us all behind.” Her bottom lip quivered as she spoke. John hastened to shush her, nodding his head to the room he had just left. Molly’s eyes widened as she slammed her lips firmly shut. Without a word, John pointed at the room next door, to which Molly nodded in response as they both crept over to quietly slide in, out of sight. As soon as he had closed the
"I suppose you ought to remove those then". John's head snapped up. It was the most he'd heard his flatmate say since he found him downstairs that morning. He blinked a couple of times, nervously darting out his tongue to wet his lips. There was a rage brewing deep within him that he was unsure exactly what he should do with. Sherlock let out a small
A small smirk tugged at the corner of his teacher’s lips as he twirled the bamboo stick in his palm. Approaching the thief on the floor, he pressed the end of the stick to their throat. “I believe you have something of mine.”
And before John had time enough to process his thoughts, he had thrown a punch aimed for Sherlock’s face. However, to his dismay, the dark haired man caught his fist in his hand, using the other to twist John’s arm behind his back, forcing him to the floor with a yelp. The smaller man winced when he felt the other man’s face press beside that of his own. “Another time then.” He said softly into John’s ear. He then let go of the blonde who was now crumpled in a heap on the floor. Sherlock stood, straightened his
, but even that was distant in the blonde’s distressed head. The more he thought about his sister, the more ferocity and speed he subconsciously introduced into his dance. His audience was captivated by the unconventional display, many were sat on the edge of their seats, jaws hanging open to occasionally utter another
His words seemed to have stung his companion as he briefly caught a glimpse of hurt that flashed across Sherlock’s face. However, as was always the case with his teacher, the expression was gone before he could fully register it. “Very well.” The dark haired man turned to face forwards; both his tone and facial expression were kept painfully neutral. For some reason unbeknown to him, this only served to irritate John further.
“Ah, finally you’re awake.” Sherlock was crouched near the end of the bed, midway through brewing a pot of tea. “I’ve decided that keeping my distance whilst you’re asleep is wise. Wouldn’t want to fracture those knuckles on my jaw again now, would we?”
"Yes, Sir." John shook himself, annoyed that he had unintentionally slipped back into his old servant habits. "Uh I mean yes, Sherlock."
The air was tense. Lestrade loomed over John, readying the bamboo in his hands. “You ready, Watson?” Without turning to look at him, John gave Lestrade a quick sharp nod, screwing his eyes shut. Lestrade slowly lifted the stick above his head then brought it shooting downwards to strike across John’s exposed back. John cried out, but held his stance, fisting his sore hands into the stone underneath. Lestrade repeated the action again and again, every onlooker wincing in fear. Three more strikes later and Lestrade was done. John was on his elbows at this point, large tender welts blossoming across his back. John shook in pain as Lestrade panted from the exertion. Mother always insisted that disciplining the servants was of upmost importance and must be severe in its nature. Lestrade dropped the stick, causing it to create a loud clang as it hit the cobbled floor. Every servant who had been watching jumped at the sound and spun back round to busy themselves with their chores. Lestrade straightened out his
with golden flower detailing. Quirking an eyebrow in disapproval, he crossed his arms over his chest. To say he was unimpressed was an understatement. John and Molly fidgeted awkwardly under his scrutinising gaze, “Alright, c’mon, out with it already. Which one of you was slacking?”
to the outside open; at least John had something nice to stare at in his boredom. But then something did catch his eye: a small group of beautiful
The mixture of scents, the warmth that enveloped his being and his fuzzy head did strange things to his body, not to mention the sweet smile that was spreading across the other man’s full lips alongside a twinkle in his eyes. John thought for a moment he saw something predatory in them, but shook the unnerving feeling off in favour of asking for something to quench his thirst. A cup of tea was immediately shoved right beneath his nose, the smell of ginger near burning his nostrils. The blonde was about to accept it when he hesitated. He tried to still the shake in his hands as he cast a nervous glance to his teacher who was bent forwards on his hands and knees, a little too close for comfort. John swallowed the dry lump that was uncomfortably lodged in his throat. “H-how do I know it’s not drugged?” He tried to keep his tone light, inwardly cursing himself for the nervous stammer. A stab of icy horror pierced his gut when he watched Sherlock’s previously jovial expression morph into something devious and calculating.
John’s heart was pounding in his chest as he stared into the crowd, but all he could see were the contorted shadows of the many attendees to his debut. The blonde subconsciously fiddled with his sleeve in nervous anticipation – if only the lights weren’t so bright on the stage then maybe he could actually see properly.
“Alright.” She snapped the fan close and stood abruptly. Both Sherlock and John followed suit, the smaller of the two stumbling a little from the sudden movement. “There is an
The two in discussion held each other’s eyes for a moment before the taller man spoke once more. “You may keep the money also.” Both the woman’s and the blonde’s heads snapped up at his words.

He nodded towards Sherlock, but his eyes were on Mycroft, "This really the same guy from earlier?" Mycroft nodded and Lestrade let out a scoff, eventually turning to face the other man. He was about to introduce himself when he was abruptly cut off.
in place between his teeth. Blowing out a puff of smoke from the opposite corner of his lips, he began to manipulate John’s fingers. The blonde grit his teeth then screwed his eyes shut. Then he bit his lip and fluttered his eyelashes. He was completely unused to anything like this, his arms were as stiff as stone. His teacher let out an exasperated sigh, his hold on the blonde’s hands tightening uncomfortably.
And with that, Sherlock’s grin vanished. A serious borderline threatening expression descended upon his features as he retorted, “Really, John. I don’t think you’re quite in the position to be making such demands. Do you?”
and then Sherlock’s hands were fisted in his hair, yanking him forwards. He opened his mouth in a lame attempt to try to take the dark haired man in, but the suddenness of the movement caused his cock to deflect off of the side of John's parted lips, spreading pre-cum across his cheek. John whimpered as Sherlock growled, pulling his face away from his crotch. Realigning him by the strands of blonde hair on his head, he pulled him forward again, only it was much slower this time, if not painfully slower.
Then the fog turned black as if swallowing everything within its sights as an impossibly loud roar erupted in his head. John’s eyes snapped open as his mind was brought crashing back down to reality, supplemented by the screech of Sherlock’s
The blonde was starting to grow weary of the drone of Sherlock’s voice. They had been practising his routine for hours, his wrists growing sore from the constant twists of his
before it was kicked away from him. Sherlock lowered his own sword over the back of John's neck in a sign of triumph. The blonde threw him an exasperated sigh whilst batting the opposing
Sherlock couldn’t prevent the chortle that escaped from his lips, his eyes crinkling in amusement as he broke their staring match to run a hot wet hand through his damp curls. The smaller of the two however remained perfectly still, his own eyes unmoving. Of course he knew that Sherlock was aware of his attempt to play dumb, but he refused to give the other man’s curiosity the satisfaction. Before John could begin to enjoy his brief moment of victory, Sherlock retorted:
Nothing happened. The blonde was confused. He could hardly even hear the sound of the other man breathing. Hesitantly, he opened an eye, expecting the worst. But he was met with the image of the other man staring inquisitively at John's limp member, as if it were a puzzle he was trying to solve. He had kept his hands to himself, his palms turned downwards and firmly planted a top of his thighs. John blinked in confusion.
There was a moment of silence as they held each other's gaze. In that moment, John began to admire the way in which the other man's distinct features quite nicely framed his eyes and those lips. These thoughts were being mixed together in Sherlock's scent that heavily lingered on his bed sheets. John tried to grip the sheets, blaming his overloaded senses on the delirious feeling caused by the drug. He blinked heavily in discomfort. One minute, Sherlock was at the other end of the room, the next he was right beside him, delicately stroking the blonde's damp hair.
Mycroft let out a mildly exasperated sigh, "Well how are you, is usually good place to start, is it not? Brother, I have not seen you in years, let alone heard from you. Did you not receive my letters?"
The smaller man broke their gaze to focus on the horizon again. He drew in a deep breath, closing his eyes as he did so. Slowly he opened them again as he exhaled. Sherlock was watching his every move.
It was unlike John to play the hero or chase after villains; in fact it was very much outside of his character. He was more accustomed to hiding himself away, preferring to avoid trouble rather than be at its core. However this was different. This person had done his partner wrong.
“You can’t be serious?!” Lestrade bellowed again, throwing his arms outwards in a vain attempt to vent his anger. Having dropped her notebook and pencil in shock, all colour had been completely drained from Anthea’s face. The two
“Wait! Could I um ah…”, John blushed, “Could I…hold onto you? Please? Just until I find my balance…”
hat, the guest turned to Anthea and nodded towards the two rows of servants, “Is this really necessary?”
“It’s comfortable.” The dark haired man retorted. John snapped his mouth shut as Sherlock padded his way over to sit opposite the shorter man.
"He's coming, you know." Time seemed to stand still at that very moment. "The one you seek." Sherlock clarified, but John knew exactly who he was referring to. "The man who took-"
“Perhaps,” Sherlock purred, “the drugs are in your system already.” His teacher’s icy blue eyes darted to the wound on the blonde’s arm, which John followed, blinking at the bandages in confusion. Furrowing his brow, he nervously darted out his tongue to wet his lips. A hot prickling sensation slowly began to creep up his spine – he could sense he was missing something very important, but was unable to pinpoint the reason for the growing dread that had begun to seep into his bones. Flicking his gaze back to Sherlock, he forcibly had to prevent himself from flinching at the sight: the man in question was now a mere inch away from his face and staring with such intensity, John felt as if his skin would burn from the scrutiny. That was when the apprentice realised that the look in his eyes wasn’t one of curiosity, but something else he was struggling to decipher. Suddenly, realisation came crashing down upon him:
. He’d never worn one before, let alone worn something that wasn’t plain in its appearance. He was unsure of how to respond to the comment. Thankfully the thought was forced out of his mind when the other man came to an abrupt halt. John had to tighten his grip on Sherlock’s arm to prevent himself from falling forwards.
had been discarded on its side with the blonde’s body tangled in his bedsheets. Sherlock sighed as he lifted up the bucket of water. He didn’t hesitate to throw its contents onto the sleeping man below.
John tensed, bracing himself for whatever might happen next. A thick bead of sweat rolled off of his forehead and down the side of his temple. He just about managed to grit his teeth and keep his eyes firmly shut. He waited. And waited. And waited. And...
When words finally escaped from his lips, the sound was so foreign to the previous intense silence that it caused John to flinch. "Did I wake you?"
tiles, John stared into the distance. Despite the brightness of the sun and the deep blue of the cloudless sky, the gentle breeze still managed to send a chill right through him, the hairs on his exposed arms standing on their ends. He grit his teeth, attempting to force his mind to realign his muddled thoughts. His head snapped round upon hearing the clack of the tiles. At the other end of the roof stood Sherlock, his purple
Sherlock painfully yanked John’s cock in the direction of his face and held it there. The blonde looked down from his nose at himself; each second feeling all the more crushed from the awkward position the other man had placed him in. He cautiously looked up at Sherlock, as if expecting some sort of command. He was presented with exactly that, “Spit.”, he barked.
“Beautiful, isn’t it?” John turned to look at the other man and was just about able to make out his face. That was when he realised the dark haired man was looking upwards towards the sky. He followed his line of sight to gaze at the stars with him; they were out in full force. He would’ve agreed and watched them with him were it not for the fact that there was a question niggling around in his head.
For a brief moment that barely even lasted a second, all John saw was Sherlock; those unashamed eyes of desire burning right through him. But before the blonde had time enough to react, he was thrown back into the mass of grabbing hands, which now became more feverish in their explorations. John hissed and clenched his teeth as their hold on him grew painfully tight with other hands beginning to claw at him with deep scratches. The golden strands on his head were suddenly yanked back in a sharply uncomfortable grip, leaving his neck exposed and vulnerable. The hands between his thighs grew more desperate with fingers thrusting harder and faster, as his member was pumped mercilessly without hesitation. John balled his own hands into fists as he screwed his eyes shut. Despite the insurmountable terror that coursed through his veins, he couldn’t deny the crest of an orgasm rapidly descending upon him. Arching his back as much as he could, he let out a rumbling moan as the blissful sensation of his climax washed over him. Then everything went white.
She flashed him a smile, turning to look at John who had also turned around to properly face to two of them. He blinked and then awkwardly snapped into a bow, “Ah yes thank you.” He mumbled, feeling exposed under her intense gaze.
“He said what?!” Molly squeaked, tightly clutching the small straw basket to her chest. She’d managed to slip out of the kitchen unnoticed when she saw John beckoning her from a tear in the
Both John and Molly jumped and spun around. There stood in the doorway beside them was Mother’s assistant, Lestrade. He was wearing his finest emerald green
as he spoke, only this time he held up two fingers instead of one. John somehow knew that both of them were for him.
John couldn’t stop himself from shooting a threatening look at Sherlock when he entered the room, but realised the other man had placed a damp white flannel over his eyes. He had helped himself back into the bath, his arms draped over either side of the wooden structure with his body slumped back in relaxation. For a moment, John felt almost invisible so he nearly jumped when the dark haired man addressed him without moving, “By the mirror, please.”
The detective's expression dropped a little, but the look was gone the moment it had appeared. This only served to confuse John further, but he brushed the feeling aside. Sherlock almost snapped his response.
“Shh it’s okay, I’ll look after you.” The dark haired man cooed into the smaller man’s ear, gently stroking his golden hair. Soothed by his partner’s softness, John slipped back into the dark abyss once more.
Before he had time enough to react to his conclusion, the audience erupted into a sudden array of applause, cheering and whooping. The apprentice visibility flinched from the auditory intrusion, wincing from the unprecedented approval.
He didn't notice his flatmate was behind him as he was reaching for the tea at the top of the cupboard. "Fucks sake", John whispered to himself, as he stretched upwards on his toes, his grey t-shirt riding up slightly. He almost leapt through the ceiling when he felt leather-clad hands touch the now exposed sides of his hips.
And with that, John’s focus renewed. Throwing his eyelids open, he cast his arms outwards, whipping out the ornate

. He had been watching the many passers-by with great interest. The city was out in full force, everyone wanting to make the most of the warm weather. But Sherlock’s thoughts appeared to be elsewhere – he wasn’t interested in the weather or the people or whatever else. He was focused on one thing in particular.
“I should like to see you again.” The warrior sounded very sure of himself, but the rosy shade of pink on his cheeks suggested a hint of doubt at the other man's reaction. A look a relief appeared on his features upon seeing John's wide beaming smile.
John shot him a dangerous look, “You’re going to want to shut up right about now, Sherlock.” His knuckles turning white as he gripped the edge of the kitchen counter hard.
He was about to let out a nervous chuckle of relief when he was swiftly scooped up in the other man's arms, picking him up with ease. He frantically tried to squirm. "Put me down!" He near shouted, despite his lethargic bones.
went over a sizeable bump in the road, causing them both to jolt somewhat. But the blonde was thick with exhaustion, barely able to blink himself awake. He felt rather cozy snuggled up to the body that was sat next to him, allowing himself to be lulled back to sleep when a gentle voice shushed him soothingly. He just about noticed that there was a hand placed over his as his eyes fluttered shut.
on his shoulder. "Of course and it has absolutely nothing to do with revenge." The smaller man tightened his grip on his sword at those words. His teacher noticed. "I could teach you." He offered, his voice much gentler this time, as if he were coaxing a wild animal. "Hone your skills."
causing both of them to flinch. The patrons were beginning to get a little too rowdy for Sholto’s liking. He glanced back at the garden, extending an arm to John.
, everyone's eyes were fixed on Sherlock, awaiting his approval. After less than a minutes silence, he turned away to take another sip of tea.

in her arms. Molly gave him several more nods, seemingly unable to move any other part of her body. She grew all the more tense when the dark haired man took a step towards her. John swivelled round upon hearing her take a short sharp breath, noting the lack of space between her and Sherlock. He frowned, attempting to second guess the other man’s intentions. After all, it was just the three of them alone in the wash rooms, and Sherlock was naked and looming over Molly. John grit his teeth and clenched at the newly found razor in his palm, unknowingly causing his hand to bleed. He was about to intervene when the taller man spoke, “May I have them then?”
directly in front of him. But before he could throw the door open, his head began to violently spin. Letting out a small groan, his eyes rolled into the back of his head and he fell forwards in a heap of exhausted limbs.
fans. Lining up in a row, they began to dance. John was completely transfixed; he was in awe of their grace and beauty. So rapt he was, he hadn’t noticed the other two in the room had stopped talking a while ago to watch the blonde’s fascination in amusement. Sharing a smirk, Irene addressed the smaller man, “Beautiful, aren’t they?”
John blinked several times before placing his head in his hands, letting out the air he didn't know he'd been holding in. "Fuck", he whispered. The two cups of tea were now lukewarm. John strode towards the cabinet at the other end of the room and pulled out a bottle of whiskey.
“Manners, dear boy!” Mycroft hissed. Sherlock held a hand up at his brother to shush him, his eyes still fixed on the almost quivering servant.
“Get dressed.” He near barked. And with that, he dropped to the floor to lie on his side, propping his head up with one hand. John blinked as Sherlock yawned. Upon noticing the shorter man hesitate, the taller man quirked an eyebrow, “Or perhaps you would enjoy a good beating?” His words sounded like that of a genuine question as opposed to a rhetorical threat. Regardless, John’s face immediately turned crimson as he span around to find a fresh set of clothes. Kneeling in front of an ornate chest of drawers, he pulled out a light green
. He shooed away the thought as soon as it had entered his mind, before stealing another glance at Sherlock. The embarrassment that coursed through his veins was so overwhelming; he had to forcibly will himself into moving from the doorway of the living room. Placing the two cups of tea down on the coffee table in front of the sofa, he almost collapsed into it as he sat down, letting out a loud sigh. It was then that the detective swivelled round, as if to reveal his new outfit.
"Ah, no!", John finally managed, trying to shake himself out of whatever had come over him. To be fair though, it's not every day one sees the infamous Sherlock Holmes dressed head-to-toe in leather. "Actually...", he began, but hesitated.
"Save it, I already know who you are." Lestrade spluttered as Sherlock continued, "Let's see them then."
, he considered voicing his thoughts, but decided against it when he looked down to take in the way the detective's bulge was straining against the leather that confined it. Shakily, he edged himself off the kitchen counter, Sherlock's hands guiding him as his feet touched the floor. Wobbling slightly, he eventually regained his balance and straightened out his spine. Before his body was given the chance to fully appreciate no longer being forced into an uncomfortable position, he felt a hand press downwards with a gentle force on his good shoulder, reminding him of the task ahead. He locked eyes with Sherlock and they held each other's gaze as he wordlessly lowered himself onto his knees.
“There you are! Slacking off again are we?” John tried to splutter an apology, but Lestrade waved it off. “Never mind that, I don’t have time for this now. Our guest has arrived and considering you’re already here, you can nip next door and run a bath for him. I’ll have to deal with you later.” And with that, he was gone.
He hadn't even noticed the other man appear from his room whilst John was making the tea. He'd nipped out into the hallway with the intention of gently knocking on Sherlock’s bedroom door, hoping to offer a mug as a means of placating his flatmate. Having noticed through the crack of the open door that he was no longer in his room, John made his way to the living room, where he was now struggling to find any air to fill his lungs.
Sherlock chuckled. “Irene,” he spoke softly, gently taking one of her hands in his own. “I owe you so much for helping my apprentice here perfect their skills and training. The least I can do is give you this.”
“Ah ha!”, exclaimed Sherlock triumphantly. Using his other hand, he mopped up what he could find of John’s spit and crudely used it to lube the doctor's still aching cock.
“Tell me about your battles. Your adventures. Your life.” Everything about him was suddenly dripping with confidence. He had strengthened his resolve. “I should like to hear it all.”
. “I better go get some more sleep then.” He wasn’t met with a response so the blonde took that as permission to leave. Quietly clearing away the tea, he softly crept over to the adjoining
Molly had brought him earlier, which served to bring out the light blue colour of his piercing eyes. The only dishevelled characteristic that remained was his loose dark curls. He looked almost regal.
before crossing the space between them, forcing John back into the counter again. It pressed uncomfortably against the small of his back as the dark haired man trapped him there with his hands on either side of him. He spoke again, only this time his lips were pressed against John's ear, "Or perhaps I should tear them off you instead". And with that, he took the back his head in one of his hands, gently tugging at his blonde hair so as to expose his neck. Before John had enough time to react, Sherlock placed his tongue at the space just above his collarbone and licked upwards to the edge of his jawline.
did her level best to ignore his questions, lifting herself up to busy herself with the rest of the preparations. John let out an exasperated sigh, trying to remain as calm as possible. He had never done anything like this before in his entire life and all he wanted right now was the reassurances of his teacher.
A moment passed where the taller of the two stared at the other man in disbelief. He turned to gently place both hands on either side of John’s arms, pressing reassuringly. “I’ll be there.” He near whispered, “I’ve got you.” The blonde looked up at that point, his eyes swirling with relief. A small smile peaked at the corners of Sherlock’s lips, but then he straightened his posture and gave the other man a firm pat on the shoulder. “Besides Irene’s place gets far more footfall than my brother’s. We’ll be more likely to find our guy there.”
fan nervously, a small frown marking her brow. Mother had insisted she look out for their guest, but neglected to inform her exactly who or what to look out for. Suddenly her ears picked up the somewhat foreign sound of hooves against cobble. She turned her head to be met with the image of a dark haired man in an old navy

gently push his chin upwards. Irene was angling his face to so as to inspect him. John tried to gulp as quietly as possible when he saw the sparkle in her eyes. He let out the breath he didn’t know he’d been holding in when she removed her fan, throwing it open to flutter it. Sherlock smiled fondly at her as she did so.
John almost flinched from the sudden attention; this whole time feeling like more of a fly on the wall. He managed a nod as he picked up the pot of tea and began to pour. As he did so, Lestrade let out an angry shout, “Bloody bastard!”
Sherlock's mouth felt dry to that of John's, but this only served to excite the blonde more. Feeling brave, he arched his body into Sherlock whilst cautiously reaching up to feed his shaking fingers through his hair. It felt thick with dried sweat, probably from his expedition at the club a few hours before. The shorter man tugged his head a little further forward in an attempt to deepen their kiss. This was welcomed enthusiastically, with Sherlock's tongue now forcing its way into his mouth, exploring fervently. A loud yet muffled moan escaped from John and before he knew it, Sherlock had roughly grabbed him by the waist, lifting him up and sitting him on the kitchen counter. Yanking down his soaked underwear, he tossed it behind him, causing them to create a noisy splat when they hit the floor. Under other circumstances, John would've laughed. This however was a very different set of circumstances indeed. He blushed hard and averted his eyes. The dark haired man flashed him a toothy grin, "Blushing suits you. I should make you wet yourself more often".
John’s eyes felt like they had grown wider and wider with every one of Sherlock’s words. He didn’t think to stop himself from commenting. “That was…”, he let out a breath he didn’t know he was holding in, “…amazing!”
opposite to the one Sherlock had entered from. Kneeling back down again, she slid the door open. On the opposite side were three figures. John only recognised Lestrade who casually strolled in, the other two accompanying him following swiftly behind. His relaxed demeanour erased the previous intensity of the room as he spoke.
to his room open. The blonde turned to bow, but faltered when he recognised the other man’s old navy
“Oh for goodness sake, I have no patience for such insincere gestures.” John lifted his head to throw a confused look at the man stood opposite him, a hard blush crossing his cheeks as he realised Sherlock was near naked. He was about to look away when the dark haired man spoke again, “Do get up”. John slowly rose to his feet, awkwardly shuffling on the spot, unsure of where to look. He couldn’t help but catch Sherlock’s eyes when the strange man continued to speak, “What’s your name then?”
“Character…?” An almost sadistic smile spread across Mycroft’s features. It was enough to send a chill down the smaller man’s spine, but Sherlock was undeterred.
John snapped his head round, “If it’s a whore you want then there are places for that elsewhere.” He couldn’t stop his anger from tinging his voice.
John blinked, remembering what had been asked of him. “Y-yes, Sherlock.” He quickly spun round and made for his escape.
He wished she didn’t call him that, but then again they were like family after all. He shifted out of Molly’s reach, rubbing his arm. “Yeah yeah visitor and all that. I got it.” And with that, he slid open the door, slipped out of his room and quickly disappeared down the narrow corridor, leaving behind a slightly frazzled-looking Molly.
“Ah!” Another nightmare. John’s heart raced as he instinctively gripped the bedsheets, trying to catch his breath. Screwing his eyes shut, he rubbed at the back of his neck, turning to throw an angry glare at his
The smaller man nodded numbly in agreement; his eyes were now staring at the caps of his flatmate's shiny black boots. He felt his body go a little limp.
“So tell me,” he languidly removed the flannel from his eyes to flippantly drop it on the floor. He then calmly focused his gaze on John, “What’s all this
John felt lost without any chores to do and horribly misplaced just mooching about the House. He decided to go gather his thoughts in his favourite spot.
“Muscle relaxant.” The other stated factually, repositioning them both into the way they were sat together before. “You were far too stiff earlier. This’ll make things much easier.” And with that, he placed his legs on either side of his subdued student, taking his now limp hands and manipulated them over the strings of the
He snapped his eyes wide open, remembering his dream from a few hours before. He reached his hands upwards, fisting them into his short blonde hair. He’d been experiencing these nightmares ever since he was a boy, but he could never truly recall what had happened to him and his sister. It was just nightmare after nightmare of the same thing: forever wanting to save her, but always losing her in the end. John clenched his teeth and screwed his eyes shut. Gripping his hair tighter and letting out a small shudder, he silently sobbed on the roof of the House. If only he knew what had happened to Harry…
A dark shade of crimson erupted across the smaller man's cheeks. He blinked several times before realising the other man was staring at him expectedly. John gripped at the soft material of his
Wiping his mouth, he nodded his thanks as he handed Molly back her pouch. “I need some air”, he gave her a weak smile, throwing the thin sheet off of his still sweating body. He stood up to stretch his now aching limbs. Molly winced upon hearing the crack that emanated from John’s spine. Rubbing the back of his neck, he made for the door. A gentle tug on the arm of his off-white
John hadn’t thought about that, especially given every part of him currently felt numb. He stammered his response, “I-I don’t know really.”
“But this is impossible! There’s nowhere near enough time for the training, let alone discipline. It just can’t be done!”
,” he spat out the word, to Molly’s astonishment. Sherlock’s tirade continued to roll off his tongue, “Related by blood, that is. If you must know, I am his brother and I can very easily be terrifying, if needs be. Any more questions?” John and Molly continued to look in shock, barely registering what had been said.
“I told you, I’m fine.” But his words went unheard. Sherlock snapped his head round to face Lestrade.
shot past him to manhandle the mysterious man off of the floor. “We received your message.” Finally catching his breath, he straightened to fix eyes with the man in question. “Are you alright?”
“W-Watson. John Watson, Sir”, he stammered, his blush growing as Sherlock continued to undress himself.
“I could fix it for you.” John offered, indicating to the various rips and tears in the other man’s robe.
The other man paused before responding, taking time to examine the smaller man's face. Finally he gave his response. "Human trafficker. Well connected. Very dangerous." He began to close the gap between them. "He ventures to the city every now and then for business." He stopped immediately in front of John, peering down at him from his nose. "And for pleasure also."
A nasty crack emanated from the blow, whether it came from the dark haired man's face or the blonde's fist, neither of them knew, as John had thrown himself out from under the bed sheets to leap at the other man in a fit of rage.
away to scramble back to his feet, patting the dirt and dust off of his now ruined garments. He froze upon hearing the other man's next words.
, with feet dancing hurriedly, but effortlessly, in an attempt to outwit the other. However, both managed to keep up with the other, failing to land a single blow on their opponent. Then they came to a grinding halt as their swords connected perpendicular between them both, their faces coming forwards so their noses almost touched. Sherlock's smug look remained with John's frustration still burning. "Self-taught?"
A hand was placed gingerly on his shoulder. The blonde looked up to meet the other man's attempt at a comforting smile. "And then we find your sister."
“Ah...” John was unsure what to do with himself at this point so he reverted back to what he knew. “Tea?”
“Yes, Sir. Sorry, Sir.” Molly bowed, throwing her hands in front of her and pressing her forehead to the floor. Lestrade shot a
of varying shapes, colours and sizes. The blonde desperately wanted to catch his eye before his performance was about to begin, but his teacher was seemingly focused on producing the introductory melody to John’s dance. The performer in question clenched his fists, took in a deep breath and closed his eyes. Willing away the flush spreading across his cheeks and the sweat on his brow, an almost inaudible whisper cut its way through the growing anxiety in his head:
John spun back round, a foreign feeling he couldn’t describe shot through him. He wasn’t accustomed to being referred to by his first name. “Yes, Sir?”
“Consider it more of a loan.” Sherlock smiled at her, but it came across as strained. Irene raised an eyebrow inquisitively.
His teacher threw him a confused look. "You'd rather be left immobilised on the floor?" It sounded like a genuine question as opposed to a snide remark. The blonde bit his lip in frustration and numbly shook his head. "Yes, that would be rather unwise, I should think." Sherlock crossed over to his room, kneeling softly by his bed and carefully placed the limp man down as gently as he could.
“Mmph!”, was all he could manage, with his flatmate’s hand still firmly holding his cheeks. He grumbled some more as Sherlock began to pump his throbbing member, twisting and arching himself in an effort to seek out a more comfortable position for his body. The leather of the gloves felt oddly pleasurable against his sensitive skin. He moaned loudly when the leather-clad hand encircled the sensitive head of his cock. Sherlock purred approvingly at John’s response, “I thought you might enjoy the gloves.”
The blonde faltered at the other man’s visible irritation. He shakily stood, but kept his eyes averted. “Should I go fetch you a cane?” John’s voice came out small and wobbly.
Whilst he was busy gazing into her eyes with as much sincerity as he could muster, John was kneeling beside the two of them, squirming uncomfortably from their intimacy.
The doctor's fury returned. "Fuck you", only his words were barely audible, as the detective was slowly leaning his face closer to that of John's. It was then that Sherlock softly planted a tender kiss on his lips.
He shot upwards with a blubbering shout of surprise. “Morning.” Sherlock chirped, eliciting a glare from a very disgruntled looking John. The taller man tossed the bucket aside causing it to create a loud bang as it connected with the floor. The previous look of amusement had been hastily replaced with that of disappointment, “It’s almost noon.”
John nearly leapt from the sudden attention, as a dark shade of crimson bloomed across his cheeks. He forcibly removed himself from where he was kneeling, his face a little too close to Sherlock’s crotch. He stumbled slightly as he stood. “Y-yes, Sherlock. I’ll go get that for you now.” He turned, shooting past Molly without giving her so much as a glance and approached a pile of ornate wooden boxes at the opposite end of the room. Throwing one of the many lids open, he shakily fumbled through to find their guest a razor. He had to will himself from jumping again when he heard the other man speak.
The dark haired man was about to explain his methods of deduction at greater length when John spoke again. “I won’t do it.”
Despite the blonde's aggression, the other man's face remained perfectly still. He responded calmly, "John, I travel the country training
The dark haired man blinked when he turned to look over his shoulder at the red faced blonde although this time it was a look of rage, not embarrassment. He spoke plainly, “I’m making a deal.”
“In answer to your questions, yes I believe John did see the state of me. I suppose by everyone else’s standards here, yes I am a bit of a mess. No, I am not a vagabond. Yes, I am related to
that evening. He shifted awkwardly in the seat of the man pulled rickshaw, wishing he had more space so that his side wasn’t pressed so close to that of Sherlock. The other man paid him no mind though, seemingly in favour of watching the people go by. The blonde squirmed some more. Then he cleared his throat. Then he tried to catch Sherlock’s eye. He sighed in exasperation and resigned to addressing the other man directly instead. “What was that?”
John shifted awkwardly on his knees, his palms placed flat over the tops of his thighs with his head slightly bowed. He glanced from Mycroft to Anthea and back again, expecting something to finally happen, but no one had said a word since they entered the room. All that could be heard was the scratchy scribblings of Anthea rapidly writing away in her notebook alongside the gentle wafts of air emanating from Mycroft's
. He was still at a disadvantage. A chill shot through his spine as he shivered from the thought that these moments could be his last.
. Despite the darkness, the blonde turned to look in the direction of where Sherlock might be sat outside. He fumbled with edges of his blanket for a moment, biting his lip in contemplation. He considered bringing the other man some tea, but hastily changed his mind in favour of curling up to go back to sleep. He told himself that those final moments of last night never happened.
, John had quickly poked his head back inside to find some kind of light for their evening stroll. As he turned his head, he had to stop himself from leaping in fright at the sight of Sherlock leaning casually against the opposite side of the
Had John had his wits about him, he would’ve been purposefully stubborn and pushed past him; however in his delirious state he couldn’t find the strength to act defiant. Instead, he sluggishly nodded in response, slipping out of his seat to collapse into the other man’s arms. The driver of the rickshaw turned to throw them an irritated look, which Sherlock met with venomous scowl. “That’ll be all. You may leave now.” His tone was dripping with a promise of unspoken threats and violence. The driver flinched at this, nodding quickly before speeding away down the cobbled street. The dark haired man was pulled back to his situation upon hearing a low groan emanate from the limp blonde in his arms.
“It’s a necessity, John. You’ll get used to it.” He was about to continue his stroll when he felt a tug on the sleeve of his
Then his attacker shot forwards with unbelievable speed, their sword drawn behind them with the intention of swooping forwards in a lethal blow. John swore as he rolled away from the assault. Again he was pursued in near darkness by fast paced swooshes of a deadly sharp blade. The blonde dodged and dived away from their attacks, but was unable to land a single blow. He mentally kicked himself for not having some kind of weapon on his persons when he caught sight of both his and Sherlock’s
, John." John let out a small huff of relief that was subconsciously tinged with a hint of regret. "I won't be back until the early hours of tomorrow morning. Eat something and get some sleep."
“You’re the girl from earlier.” It was clear he was talking to Molly, despite the fact that his eyes were burning a hole in the back of John’s head. Molly nodded anyway, her face pale as she began tremble all over. Sherlock finally turned to look at her, struggling to break his gaze from the man at the other end of the room. “And I suppose those are for me?” He gestured at the
A firm hand on his shoulder snapped him out of his thoughts. “John,” Sherlock’s voice was steady and sure, “Let’s go home.”
, John triumphantly thought. Puffing out his chest and straightening his posture, he responded as coolly as possible, “I don’t know what you mean”.
at the opposite end of the yard suddenly slid open with a bang, causing almost everyone to jump. The only exception was the visitor, whose eyes were still fixed on Molly. However she had since focused her gaze on the floor again and began to retreat backwards as Mother came tearing down the path.
“Hm? Oh, no of course not.” Sherlock murmured as he squeezed at the cut. “I’m checking, just in case.”
Just then, a brief flicker of light danced across the wall. When it disappeared, it was accompanied by a soft exhale. John supposed that the other man was back on the porch again smoking his
A panicked look erupted across John’s features as he scrambled out of his now soaking wet bed to bow to the other man in an attempt to beg for forgiveness. Just as he was about to voice his apology, the darker haired man cut him off. “What did I say about insincere gestures, John?”
Having heard the front door slam shut moments before, followed by hurried footsteps up the staircase and the click of Sherlock's bedroom door close, John took it upon himself to make them both a cuppa each.
“Come here.” The smaller man froze. He could feel a shiver creep up his spine, which he told himself was because of his wet clothes and nothing to do with the other man in the room burning holes in the back of his head.
John shuffled awkwardly down the cobbled street, trying his best to ignore all the staring and whispering from passersby. He wished the other man would slow down. Letting out a frustrated sigh, he conceded defeat. “Sher-Sherlock?”
That last thought was enough to shake John out of his reverie. He was suddenly painfully aware that his face was sporting a warm shade of crimson and that his trousers were feeling a lot tighter than usual.
, John thought distantly. He was suddenly snapped out of his trance upon hearing Anthea click her fingers at him. Without looking up from her book, she pointed downwards at the tea. A blush bloomed across his cheeks as he reached out to pour two cups. Neither one of the brothers broke eye contact with the other, ignoring the freshly poured tea in favour of sitting for a moment longer in complete silence. John wanted to squirm from the awkward intensity. Even Anthea had stopped writing. Mycroft finally spoke again.
. But John chose to shrug instead. It looked like more of a twitch, given his inability to properly move his own limbs.
“Very impressive.” Irene purred into his ear. John bit the bottom of his lip to prevent himself from twisting out of her grasp. Her next words were directed elsewhere. “Are you sure what you’re dealing with here is just an apprentice?”
When the finger connected with his prostate, he eyes flew open as a shock was sent through his body, causing him to inadvertently smack the back of his head against the cupboard. Sherlock chuckled, which John both heard and felt vibrate around his dick. His finger stroked his prostrate again and again with relentless repetition. An incoherent string of sounds escaped from John, eventually forming words, "Sh-Sherlock, I can't, I'm going to, ah fuck-!" And as his entrance instinctively tightened around Sherlock's finger, the dark haired man removed his mouth from John's cock in favour of pumping him mercilessly. John cried out as he came in long spurts all over his chest, a couple of drops landing on his face. He puffed as his head swam in a sea of dazed thoughts, barely registering his flatmate remove his finger from inside him. The other hand was used to gently wipe away John's own cum from the bottom of his lip followed by another on the side of one of John's cheeks. He remained slumped in a messy heap for a brief moment longer before being pulled forwards into a gentle embrace. "Your shirt...", he murmured, but Sherlock shushed him, pressing John's wet chest into that of his own. The detective held him there, softly stroking John's hair as the doctor sighed into him, relief spreading through his body as he relaxed into his flatmate's tender hold.
Also I'm going to be a dingus and only upload the one chapter this week. Life is crazy busy right now so it'll be another week until I post again. Oh the suspense...!
The blonde threw his weight forwards into the other man, causing their swords to deflect each other. They both leapt away to create some distance between them, briefly pausing to catch their breath. "I don't just sit on the roof in my spare time, you know." John tried to catch his breath whilst sounding as nonchalant as he could. "A servant needs a hobby to pass the time."
The smaller man let out a small whimper as the dark haired man gently lifted him back up again. “Sh-Sherlock, what did you…”
John couldn’t help the frustration from tinging his voice this time, “Then with all due respect, Sherlock, I should like to request that I am dismissed.”
"Gladly", John snorted, as he struggled to pull himself up from off the floor. Sherlock extended a hand, which he accepted gratefully.
On the ride back home, John suddenly realised how tired he was and had drifted to sleep. His head had unintentionally found itself leaning against Sherlock’s shoulder. He was only vaguely aware of this when the
"I need to blend in", he offered calmly, turning his face towards the mirror at the opposite end of the room to readjust the lapels of his black leather biker jacket. With his body half turned away from where John was still gawping, his eyes inadvertently flicked downwards to take in the way those leather trousers rather nicely framed Sherlock's behind.
Before he could finish his thought process, he picked up on a sudden whistling sound that was fast approaching. His assailant had thrown several
“You can take one of our rickshaw, if you want. We took two to get here.” Lestrade threw a thumb behind him in the direction of the two carriages at the end of the side street. A crowd had gathered to watch all the commotion.
The guest scoffed, breaking eye contact to observe the courtyard. “A reputation, eh? As the Mistress of a whore house? Surely you can do better, Mycroft.” Everyone was shocked by the visitor once more. Not even Lestrade or Anthea would dare speak to Mother like that.
against his shoulder, he continued with an air of disinterest. "And nothing is the answer to your question. I had rather hoped to avoid my brother's pleas for help, but I ended up relenting eventually." He sighed. "All this trafficking malarkey is bad for business. Mycroft has been sharing with me his concerns that his supposedly loyal clients are seeking their pleasures elsewhere. For cheap." He twirled his
door, silently shutting it behind her. She softly crept over and placed the lamp next to him. Kneeling beside his bed, she gave him a worried look. "Same as last time?"
John sighed. A look a determination appeared in his eyes as he turned to lock eyes with the dark haired man. "So if become a
“Shh!” John held a finger up to his mouth. The last thing he wanted was for them to be caught. She’d be beaten without hesitation for abandoning her chores.
bed, beads of sweat rolling off his tense muscles. The fear from his nightmare lingered, but he managed to blink himself back to reality, gripping the bedsheets tight. Taking a couple of slow deep breaths, he reminded himself of his surroundings in an attempt to remain calm. He nearly jumped when he heard the sound of the bedroom door slide open, wincing at the flickering light that now flooded the room. John blinked again and let out a small sigh upon recognising the figure holding the lamp: it was Molly.
“Marvellous!” The woman threw her hands upwards to accentuate her excitement. She spun around to head back into her House. “Come come, my darlings. We have much catching up to do.” She cast a wink over her shoulder at Sherlock as she made her way inside.
The blonde just about dodged the swing of the blade, nearly cutting off the tip of his nose. Snapping himself out of his reverie, his strengthened his resolve. Darting forwards, he jabbed his opponent in their upper thighs, hitting their pressure points dead on, causing them to collapse backwards from the momentary loss of sensation in their legs. John took the opportunity to violently stamp on their knee, crushing the vulnerable knee cap as a result. Their attacker let out a loud pained howl as he felt the fragile bones underneath his foot snap with an audible crack. He was about to strike a deadly hit in their throat with the intention of at least fracturing their spine when he heard shouting in the distance. Suddenly, several of the surrounding
He just about managed to stifle a squeak, but his voice was shaky. "Sherlock, what-", he was cut off by the body behind him pressing him forwards into the kitchen counter, causing the shorter man to throw his arms forward so as to prevent his face from connecting with the cupboard in front. One of the leather hands was removed from his side to push at the middle of his shoulders, leaving him pressed up against and bent over the counter. He was about to protest when he felt the press of a bulge against his arse cheeks. A loud gasp was forced from him as his face flushed a rosy shade of pink.
, he thought. Letting out a mildly exasperated sigh, he set about putting the kettle on. But what he was presented with in the living room was far beyond what he had anticipated.
“You heard me.” He began. He waited for a response, but when none came, John gulped and continued, “Just now. You heard my nightmare.”
The silver haired man momentarily furrowed his brow, his mouth then forming an amused smirk, "So he spent the evening in Soho then, did he?"
, his head was screaming at him, but John's cock had become undoubtedly hard. He'd wanted this for so long. Each day had been utter torture for him, longing for the attention of his flatmate, convincing himself over and over that it was never meant to be. Hundreds, if not thousands of indecent thoughts permeated his mind, day in day out. There were so many things he wanted to do to the man whose body was pressed up against his, but now that it was finally happening, he could only manage a whimper.
John noted the lack of genuine concern in Lestrade’s tone. “Yes, perfectly fine.” Came the taller man’s curt response. “Although John here is injured.” He turned to cast a momentarily worried glance in his direction. The blonde shuffled awkwardly from the attention.
