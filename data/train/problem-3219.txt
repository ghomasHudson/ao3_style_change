“What’d you see?” Sam interrupts. Eileen cuts her eyes at him, and he shrugs. “What? It’s a valid question.”
“What do you mean?”
Castiel lowers his sunglasses enough to glare at his friend. “You know what.”
Everyone shifts slightly, but Patrick just keeps dealing, nodding to Gabe. “Do ya mind? It may be important.”
Cas raises a brow and stares at Dean a moment before silently heading upstairs. A few minutes later, he reappears and drops a Santa hat on Dean’s head. “Now, is this a Christmas gathering?”
Making their way up the sidewalk, Sam points out the playground where he and his brother had spent so many hours after school. “There,” he tells Eileen, gesturing to the tunnel stretching between the two platforms. “That’s where we’re supposed to meet him.”
Dean’s ears flush, and now he’s the one glancing away embarrassed. Still, he clears his throat and gives Cas’s hand a gentle squeeze as the saleswoman’s heels clack back up the hall.
The Novaks’ property spans roughly eighty acres of mixed wood and farmland, and the back of the property is bisected by a wide creek. It’s there that Dean leads Cas, following the well-maintained trails until they get to a the long-forgotten path they frequented in their youth. From there, it’s another few hundred yards to the creek, and as they catch sight of the water, their pace increases.

were together at all. Like Ellen said, the only thing anyone—other than the majority of Cas’s family, but they’re a bunch of pricks anyway, so—had a problem with was the fact that they didn’t tell anyone before supposedly getting married, and that…What the hell is Dean supposed to do with that?
As difficult as it is, Dean manages to force joy he doesn’t feel onto his face, and his voice barely shakes when he says, “Me, too.”
They’d decided to meet up with Sam and Katie for a little last minute shopping, and while their respective family members had been enough to buffer their interactions before now, something had changed. Be it by fate or chance, Castiel kept finding himself chest to chest with his friend and pseudo husband. While perusing truffles at the candy shop, he turned to ask Katie if she preferred caramel or cherry stuffed chocolates only to find Dean standing there instead. Before that, as he’d attempted to pass their hot drinks around, he’d jumped and caused a bag to drop from his elbow to his wrist, and Dean’d swooped in to save the day by moving in to steady him. Now, Castiel is trying to maintain some physical distance from the man without it being obvious, but there’s only so much room in the cramped antique store’s aisles, and
Cas blinks and huffs a laugh while rolling his jacket sleeves up to his elbows, his face a shade of red that’s frankly all kinds of adorable. “Touché,” he rasps.
Meanwhile, Katie remains utterly clueless as to the context of the erupting chaos around her. She and Sam have spread her new toys around the fireplace and play quietly with the various animals included in her little farm set. They rarely speak, opting primarily to sign back and forth, and a sudden warmth blooms in Castiel’s chest as he watches a member of the family’s newest generation masterfully communicate in an inclusive manner. Hope swells up then, choking Castiel with the thought that maybe in the future, when Katie and her peers grow up and begins taking office, the world will be a little more accommodating, a little more loving, and a little more peaceful.
gonna get rid of all his suits, but he’s definitely not gonna be wearing one anytime soon.
Gripping Cas’s jacket, Dean whirls them around and crowds him against the car, but he doesn’t say anything, just flicks his eyes over every inch of Cas’s face like he’s desperately memorizing the details. “Why are you here, Dean?”
Naomi’s shrill voice shoots through the air like a dagger, and Dean tears his eyes off the blue-eyed fiend beside him. Across the table, a flustered Gabe rips his hand out of Kali’s lap while Kali makes a mad dash for her water glass with one hand and covertly smooths her skirt with the other. Naomi is staring daggers at the couple as they attempt to right themselves, and when Gabe has to lean back in order to fasten his belt buckle Dean’s not entirely sure Naomi won’t hurl her knife at her middle child’s skull. Meanwhile, Rachel and Anna are whispering at the other end of the table—Anna no doubt attempting to steer her curious child into a different topic of discussion before she’s forced to answer some difficult and really freaking awkward questions that make Dean glad he doesn’t have to endure that trial—and Michael and Chuck wear similar glares of disgust.
Six words shouldn’t be enough to bring a man to his knees, but those would have easily managed it had it not been for the wood under Castiel’s fingers. He squeezes it so hard his skin blanches and the bones of his wrist clench painfully. Through his panic, Castiel manages a weak, “Okay.”
“You granted humanity
They laugh, and Castiel nods, tracing a finger around the rim of his cup. “I’ve run into a bit of a speedbump with the main characters.” Eileen nods, urging him on, and something in him snaps. “There’s all this tension where there shouldn’t be,” he blurts. “Romance was never a part of the story, not because I don’t think gay cowboys existed in the late 1800s, but because these particular cowboys aren’t gay. One is engaged to a lovely girl back home, and the other is a widower who’s stated several times he’ll never love again.”
Dean swallows and exhales slowly—silently—through his mouth, squeezing his eyes shut, and Castiel knows how complex Dean’s feelings are regarding his father. He’d stayed up late with him many times both before and after the man’s death while Dean ranted and complained and cried over John, and he’ll never quite understand all the ins and outs of it because Castiel’s relationship with his own father has never been anything more than lukewarm at best, and that’s hard enough, but to actually love John with such ferocity as Sam and Dean have always done…No. He’ll never understand it, but he will always be there when Dean needs him. It’s the least he can do.
"Has he ever said 'Dean, I am as straight as a ruler'? If not you can't assume shit."
Mary chuckled, "Yes, it is the girl you love enough to marry. She could be a princess from another kingdom or even someone like that little girl that Castiel knows, Meg I think Chuck said."
Little 8 year old Sam always seemed to be trailing the pair, trying to be exactly like his brother and brother figure. If Dean and Cas were studying, Sam was studying. If Dean and Cas were practicing their fencing or Football skills, Sam was just itching to go join, or at least watch the pair.
28 was when Sam and Jess finally tied the knot, now the Duke and Duchess of Pierre like Dean's parent's planned. Little baby boy Charlie was the ring bearer as Cas towed the one year old ginger with the brightest green eyes and cutest freckles down to the altar to hand his uncle and aunt their rings in the cutest little white wagon. Charlie dressed in a matching baby tux to what Cas was wearing. Dean had been Sam's best man, Charlie had been Jess' maid of honour, as over the years their friendship blossomed.
"Well Castiel is the same age as Dean and they just happened to become friends," Mary explained softly. "There is simply no boys your age that have parents that work here sweetie."
25 was when they moved to Lawrence Kansas, into the cottage that his father had lived before becoming king, it was a right of passage for the future king and their consort.
Cas' cheeks and ears blushed that deep red that Dean loved. Something came over Dean and he leaned down and pressed a chaste kiss on Cas' lips, he didn't know where that sudden spurt of courage came from but when Cas didn't react he quickly moved his head away.
"Two years ago when Charlie and her father visited in August, when we went to the lake." Cas said finally breaking his silence in the matter.
"What if I want to not marry royalty? I can meet someone who is perfect for me and they don't have to come from royal blood." Dean replied setting his flowers down and subconsciously flicking the dirt off of Cas' shoulder.
The world still spun, everything was normal. Sam finally asked out Jess for real. Dean was happy for his little brother, but that just made the matchmaking his mother loved just multiply.
"I'm just saying Cas, there is no reason why you should be nervous. If all else fails I'm sure Gabe has one of his ladies that would be willing to dance with you for one dance." Cas smiled back to his friend.
"Well if you guys out us, we out little miss Charlotte over there. Eye for an eye. As for you, you tall little fucker, I'll tell Ma about the daily adventures into town to visit your sweet little Jess while she's at school. Not only going alone without anyone else, but distracting the girl from her education in the process. You know how important education is to mom."
"I'll keep that in mind Ma," Dean said opening the palace garden door for his mother and Cas, his hands secretly brushing Cas' as he passed. Anything contact that Dean could get, he would steal.
Cas came up and moved his hands away from the shirt he had somehow forgotten to button all the way up and finished the job for Dean, "So the blue one is your favourite one, I thought it would be this one since green has always made you look so handsome."
Mary remembered a young Dean maybe 8 or 9 in his Royal lessons, the only ones he had without his friend.
"I don't have cooties!" Sam said defensively. Dean started fake coughing, over exaggerating the cough while doing it.
He had always known that he was going to one day become king, the day after his father, King Bobby sadly passed away. He would take that job with honour and promise his people that he would be half the man his father was and lead them right.
"Ah well looky here, we have a couple of lovebirds on our hands. Still doesn't matter, get up and we'll talk about this at dinner. Cas, at least attempt to brush your hair and not make it a disaster." Bobby left with no other comments and Dean looked at Cas.
Mary put down her fork and looked at her eldest with shock in her eyes. Cas didn't know if this was going to be good or not. "Two whole years? Two whole years and you didn't think to inform your father or myself or even your younger brother about this. I was over here thinking you two were just too stupid to realize your feelings."
He reached the end of the walk and stood tall beside his father. Bobby clapped his hand on Dean's shoulder proudly and announced that dinner was to be served soon. The family sat down and the guests started filing towards their own seats. Dean looked out into the crowd, looking for one boy in particular and saw him sitting in between his brother Gabriel and father Chuck, he seemed to be happy at the moment but with the eyes Gabe was making at the brunette server, Cas would get annoyed quickly. He watched as the server placed a flute of champagne next to Cas and he caught the boy's eyes and raised his glass slightly as a I told you Pops wouldn't forget about you and the champagne.
Dean and Cas were 12. Even after six years of being side by side, they were as close as ever. The palace workers had taken to calling Cas Prince Castiel as he was essentially being raised like a prince. Cas and Dean laughed at the little joke and Mary smiled each and every time she heard the term of endearment.
The two of them danced to a couple more songs, still talking, " I think my favourite Avenger has to be Captain America. Man really has his priorities set with all the Bucky mojo. I understand the loyalty towards his best friend, they've been best friends since childhood, nothing can change that. Not even the failed ending of Endgame, to me Endgame does not exist." Dean said when their conversation switched from Lord of the Rings to Avengers. Charlie looked a little closer into Dean's eyes and nodded.
That got Dean's attention. Charlie laughed at the final lightbulb moment. "You're-"
It was morning, and somehow they seemed to sleep through all their alarms. They got woken up from a very frustrated Bobby already dressed in his formal clothes and had his crown on shoving both boys out of bed. " It is 10 o'clock, you both know that town hall starts at 11 right? Also, as the host of this damned thing Dean, you should arrive around 10:30? You live in the damned place this thing is being held and you'll be late, on time is late so move your arses and get ready."
"He's my gay thing, but I'm not gay. I'm bi," Dean whispered to Charlie for only the two of them to hear. "But you understand, I can't have him."
"Charlotte would make a beautiful Queen, Dean. We could strengthen the connection between the two kingdoms. And imagine the kids, little redheads with cute little freckles like yours." Mary stated as she, Dean, and Cas made their way to meet the visiting royals in the west garden. Cas snorted at Mary's statement.
The Prince placed that crown on the top of his love's head once again, but this time he was King, adjusting the emerald to be in the perfect centre, placing a small kiss to his love's forehead when it was just right. Just like he had for all the other times his King needed to wear his crown. They hoped their kids would be as lucky in finding the same bond that the two men shared and found in this castle.
They were 20, and had been dating secretly for the past two years. It wasn't like they didn't mean to tell Dean's parents, but it never seemed like a good time to sit the King and Queen and tell them that the Heir to the crown was in a gay relationship with the boy they raised as their own. They both knew it was going to be a very difficult conversation.
"And you have every right to find someone like that, but Dean you're not going meet your future wife if you spend your days moping around the castle with Cas by your side." If Mary only knew that was exactly how he met his future husband.
"Well it's nice to know you were the last two to know about your own feelings then. But I'm still upset that you didn't tell me, I have two years of consort training to get through with Castiel now and we could've started long ago."
"Me too, now if you could stop talking while you have toothpaste in your mouth that would be appreciated." Cas said moving towards the bathroom to get ready with Dean. He kissed Dean's cheek and grabbed the gel to smooth down his perpetual sex hair. Once they were both dressed and ready, Cas placed the bronze crown on his love's head, this time with the sapphire gem the one in the centre. He quickly gave Dean's forehead a kiss once the crown was properly place, just like he had been doing for the past two years.
"Well no, I haven't he's only 14. Besides, he seems completely head over heels for Jessica, has been since he was around 10. She is a nice girl and I don't want to get involved."
"Dinner's going to be ready soon Dean and I can't find Cas to tell him-" Sam said as he entered Dean's room without knocking. The pair looked up to see the extremely tall moose looking like a deer in the headlights, they probably looked the same way. "I gotta tell Charles, she's gonna be so pleased. CHARLIE COME HERE!!"
"It is quite a nice night for a walk Dean, thank you for suggesting this." Cas said still holding Dean's hand but looking out to the calm water. He only turned his head when he felt Dean's body move. He found Dean on one knee, holding a very beautiful ring in his hand, still holding Cas' hand.
"Why does Dean get a friend? I want a friend." Sam asked randomly during the dinner.
"You need to learn sooner or later, your father isn't getting any younger here Dean." Mary said as she shooed the boys away.
"Well no shit Sammy."Dean said still happy about today's events. the rest of the family congratulated the pair and they made their way to their room, excited to be engaged.
"Mary, Sam, I think tweedle dee and dumb over there have something to announce to the rest of the family." Dean could see Sams eyes on him knowingly, he just nodded to his little brother.
Prince Dean Campbell-Singer of the kingdom of South Dakota was the eldest son of the reigning king. He had grown up in a beautiful castle, with a loving family behind him in every decision he had ever made. He was well liked by the kingdom's people, very popular with the other ladies of the kingdom as well. One hoping that one day they could be queen.
"Have you asked Charlotte out yet?" She asked one day while she and Ellen started the spring garden prep, Cas and Dean had been the unlucky ones to be tasked with unloading the flowers from the delivery truck. Sometimes Dean wished his mom could be like Charlie's and not expect him to do physical labour chores. "And Cas, how has the writing to Daphne going?"
"Why is sapphire and blue your favourite?" Cas asked tilting his head slightly, something that Dean just loved.
"What's going on tall one," Charlie said finally entering the room. Dean's room started to feel a little crowded. She took one look at the boys and look back to Sam, "I see I am fifty dollars richer now, pay up mister."
The redhead nodded, "I think South Dakota is in need of a King Ed. Now are you a fan of Marvel, or Harry Potter, or anything nerdy?"
Dean's eyes went straight to were Cas was. He didn't mean it but it just happened. "Blue eyes over there huh, not bad there Dean-o."
"Dean can you pull your head out of your ass for like five seconds and see the way you guys look at each other. You guys radiate love and commitment and look like you've been married for at least 40 years." Charlie said seriously. She turned to go join the other two boys in the lake. Dean stood there for a little longer though, trying to process what Charlie had said just a couple seconds ago. Cas couldn't be in love with him, could he?
"You just have to dance one dance, man. I'm not very stoked about the dancing aspect of this either, but Pops said we can have a flute of champagne as a birthday present so that might calm you down a bit before asking a pretty girl to dance." Dean made his way next to his friend who was flopped down on his bed, he was wrinkling the duvet but Dean just ignored that.
"For the entire time." Sam cowarded in his seat, Mary wasn't a force to be reckoned with, "They made me stay quiet Mama, it hasn't been easy on me either you know." Sam was really working the youngest kid vibe with the use of mama and the puppy dog eyes that he was sporting. Dean saw Mary's reaction calm down and rolled his eyes. Cas nudged his foot in response to the eye roll. Sam was making this easier for all of them.
Dean saw the blush on Cas as he heard his mother speak. Cas never thought of himself as more than just a commoner who got completely lucky when making friends. Dean knew about his mother's plan on giving Cas a dukedom once he got married. The king could grant commoners dukedoms but it was very rare, and his mother has a point, marrying royalty would just make the process easier and made more sense as Cas had essentially been raised royal. Dean just wished He could be the second Duke of Lawrence instead of Castiel, Duke of Lincoln.
When they finally stepped into the castle and into the grand room where the rest of the family was sitting, Dean heard Jess screech. When he finally could hear again he saw the blonde girl hugging Cas tightly and Sam patting him on the back.
"Well who's saying you don't already have cooties? You have been hanging out with lil Jessie a lot. Oh no, look at Cas he looks a little flushed, and he's burning up. You might've passed the cooties on to Cas and I." Dean said playfully. Mary rolled her eyes at the antics. Bobby hid his laugh with a cough and Cas held back a smile.
"I see." Dean continued eating as the dancing was going to start soon. Charlotte was on his list of potential partners to dance with, she seemed cool.
"Oh but you made it your mission to get Cas and I to marry royalty but Sammy boy is allowed to fall in love with the first girl that waltzes into his life years ago with her little curls and giggle?" Dean was agitated, he wasn't against marrying a royal girl, hell worst comes to worst he'll court that Lady Elsia and make her a Queen, but he was in love with Cas, had been since that fateful 16th birthday when a semi-truck of emotions hit him after the conversation with Charlie. Cas had stopped dancing with Meg once he saw Dean and Charlie stop and go talk to Dorothy, joining them instead of talking to the brunette.
"What, you've discussed this already?" Cas said shocked.
"Sam," Cas said scratchily, his voice almost non existent. "Cooties spread quickly, and I don't think I have much time left, neither does Dean. Your parents are safe, they've already had their cootie shots."
"Ah come on Pops, it was harmless." Dean said to his father, clearly trying to fight his parents on apologizing.
During dinner, his mother was slyly pointing out different girls to Dean. She pointed to a pale redhead who looked carefree and exciting. "That's Princess Charlotte of the Kingdom of Arizona."
"Well look at that, my little boy is all grown up, getting married. I know Your mother is proud of you, I am as well. It's all Mary has been talking about, 'Cas is doing wonderfully in his lessons, he's such a great addition to this family.' It seems like we will have the Duke and Duke of Lawrence sooner than later." Dean could see the excitement in his father's eyes as Bobby shooed him away to get ready for the evening.
Finally it was over and Dean could get out of the uncomfortable outfit that his kingdom decided was an acceptable choice thousands of years ago.
“You aren’t from here. Your blood is not of ours,” the leader of the soldiers stepped forward.
“Maybe I should thank Sam.”
He looked down at his hands. They were a soft red and he had slight claws. He rushed to the mirror in the hall. He touched his face carefully. He was almost Hellboy red. His freckles maroon. His eyes were solid black and to top it off he had horns. Dean grinned at his reflection. He felt something move and tried to turn and see it but couldn’t. Then it flicked into view. He grabbed it. He had a tail.
“Is that why you were speed reading through medical books?” Dean grinned as he handed Cas a plate.
“I am where it counts.”
“Dean.”
to say it.”
“The city isn’t in total blackness. I’m not giving you head in a car when anyone could see us,” Cas rolled his eyes and got in the car.
“Yes. I understand,” Cas felt his face go warm.
“I do. As soon as you let me know that this was happening I did thorough research and spoke with several doctors.”
“How long is that gonna take?”
Sam cleared his throat.
“I think part of the apology is doin’ the thing with you.”
“No. This ain’t real,” Dean dropped Sam and turned and looked at the bus stop.
“Love you too.”
“Jack you’re safe,” Cas hooked the staff to his backpack and pulled Jack into a hug.
“Ready?”
“You’re internet famous,” Dean grinned.
“Arrangements have already been made. Robert Singer is your guard. He is waiting for you on the ship. We have people that will handle your affairs now that you are headed home.”
Dean was a bit of a neat freak. He hadn’t realized it until he’d moved in with his boyfriend. His clutter bug boyfriend. His boyfriend that let cereal basically come to life in a bowl on his dresser before he took it to the kitchen. His boyfriend that didn’t rinse out the shower after a day of getting covered in mud taking care of the calves at the farm he volunteered at. Dean knew he should have spoken up before he let it all get to him. He hadn’t and he exploded on Cas.
“How’d you find me?”
“I don’t even remember which song it was.”
The creature read through everything quickly by what Dean could tell. He turned and stared at Dean.
“I am in all the ways that count. We will be getting out of your hair now.”
“Yes of course. Is there anyone else that we need to call? His mother?”
“It was recess. There has been a storm so we tried to keep the kids on the blacktop and out of the grass. When the sun came out the kids were excited. There were several rainbows and the kids went to try and find the end of the rainbows, you know to get the pot of gold,” her smile twitched with sadness, “Jack kept trying to keep the kids away from the rainbow for some reason.”
“Yes, but you were…very small.”
“You don’t know that.”
“Sort of,” Castiel giggled, “once we are home and not just on our ship we can be in our true forms completely and it will be more enjoyable.”
“Sap.”
“My mind was still me.”
“I figured. I needed to distract it so that you could move into place,” Cas smiled as Sam rushed forward and grabbed the keys that had fallen from around the shifter’s neck.
“Give me my son and I’ll sign.”
“Rowena just text. They’ll be here tomorrow. Oh my god,” Sam made a face, “you really gonna eat all that?”
“That’s better. We can do more later. I just wanted to make sure that you knew that I wanted it too.”
“NOPE! None of that!” Dean pushed off from his door and went to his stash of magazines. He just needed to take the edge off. Yup that was it.
“Oh. Okay. Yes. I would like that.”
“I can’t wait until we’re ready for me. To share me fully with you.”
“Goddess be with me,” Cas squared his shoulders and walked into the rainbow.
Sam rushed off.
“I got off early.”
“Yeah come on Cas,” Dean moaned and arched under him.
Cas had found out that the politician was Lucian Davenport. Cas couldn’t go to the police when Kelly didn’t come home because Lucian had his hands on everything. He was also the head of Clan Davenport. Some of the most powerful sidhe clans that had crossed the Atlantic. The good folk were powerful even away from their homelands. They only wanted a pure bloodline and Kelly wasn’t of fae decent. Cas had to protect Jack.
“I eat when I’m anxious too,” he made himself a plate and ate next to Cas, “you know I’ve only known you a few days but I kinda feel like I’ve known you forever.”
“You are not afraid. Many times I have visited this planet and the humans were full of fear. I was assaulted on many occasions.”
After they finished in the dungeon they bathed together then went back to Dean’s room. It was different than the last time. It was soft and comforting and they took their time to find their pleasure. Cas fell asleep in his arms and for the first time in almost a decade, he didn’t worry about Jack.
Dean looked down at the tickets again. He’d had them for a few days but hadn’t figured out how to corner Cas and get him to listen to him. He shoved them in his bag and pressed the button to call the elevator.
“It’s okay. You’re safe. You came to be in a safe realm it would seem,” Cas kissed his hair as he hugged him.
Dean grunted and headed to shower. He didn’t want to talk about it. He went to bed right after to avoid Sam and his nosiness.
Cas had known that it was bound to happen. The politician hadn’t wanted the baby to be born. He’d given Kelly a large sum of money to terminate the pregnancy and to keep her quiet. She’d put the money in Cas’ name to help care for Jack.
“Oh everything is fine,” she giggled, “anesthesia affects everyone differently. Mr. Winchester is a little,” she giggled again, “enthusiastically in love with you and wanted to make sure that everyone knew it. We learned a little more about your sex life than we needed to but he is doing fine in recovery.”
Dean hadn’t thought about it. He was just ready to get to Cas. He dimmed the beam of light. It was nighttime so they needed a little light to make it through but not the full blast of the flashlight. He saw a light source as they continued through the abandoned store. They eased their way down the escalator turned stairs without power.
“It doesn’t happen often. I can sense now that you’re exhausted. I will go to another set of hunters.”
“So you want to use my son as bait? He’s a child!” Cas felt his power flare in him again.
“Yes.”
Lucian began to tremble as Dean lifted his hand and stared at him unblinking.
“Uh-huh,” is all Dean manages, and he tries to subtly shift his body so that Cas can’t tell exactly how hard he is right now, but Cas, the fucker that he is, notices, and the grin that spreads across his face does little to help things.
Dean’s hand is warm where it wraps around Castiel’s own as he pulls him back toward the house, and for a fleeting, horrifying moment, Castiel thinks he’s going to force him back inside. Fitting, he thinks, seeing as how the rest of his evening is determined to crash and burn, but no, as they near the edge of the yard, Dean skirts the far reaches of the security lights and the hubbub of the party until they’re ducking behind his beloved Impala’s fender. Both breathe heavily, crouched down and shivering from the night air, and Dean peeks over the hood for several moments before slipping back to the passenger door and easing it open. Once he’s crawled across the seat, he waves Castiel inside, and both stay hunched over and giggling—because they’re children, okay—until Dean fires up the engine. Baby comes alive with a roar, and Castiel only glimpses the surprised faces of the partygoers as they speed away from the house and into the night.
“Dean, I—I want you.” There’s a sharp inhale, and Castiel isn’t sure if it came from himself or Dean, but he plows on, fisting his hands in the front of Dean’s coat and choking on his words. “I don’t know how to do this, but I want to try. I want to try…with you.”
Gabriel’s eyes widen a fraction, but then his face lights up. “Dean-o? Really? Oh, this just keeps getting better! Kali!” He turns to where his fiancée is still seated on the far side of the table, her lips quirking at his antics. “This is Dean, Cassie’s best friend growing up and now
“Cas? Cas!”
_____________
over these freaking dinners.
He crosses the room in a few quick strides and leads Dean toward the front door by the hand, but before they can make it outside, Naomi runs into the hall and calls after them.
Dean steps back, his hands held up between them. “Look, pal, I don’t know what your deal is, but—” he holds up his left hand and points at the ring there for good measure, “—I’m married, alright? That means I’m off the market. And another thing, how could you step out on your wife, huh? I thought only douchebags did that.”
Sam glances over Dean’s shoulder before smiling again and backing away. “Whatever you say. I’m gonna go check on the girls.”
Castiel maintains the eye contact for a moment, unable to
“But I’ve got it anyway.”
Cas pads out of the room, and Dean gives in to the urge to grind against the sheet. It’s not enough though, so he gets up and quickly readies the shower, praying there’s still enough hot water for what he has in mind and that he can get it done without Cas hearing him. Luckily, the answer to both of those questions is a yes.
Naomi clears her throat and raises her chin. “I understand some of Dean’s family was taken to the hospital.”
Cas, ever his guardian angel, slides his hand down Dean’s forearm until he can lace their fingers together, and Dean grips onto the man like a lifeline while the chatter continues on around them. Mary has moved on to hug Cas while Sam slaps Dean on the shoulder and drones on about…well, Dean’s not exactly sure what his little brother is talking about. It’s all a droll buzzing in his ears at this point, but he manages to nod in all the right places—which is a fucking miracle in and of itself—until Sam squeezes his shoulder tightly and disappears into the other room with Katie on his hip and Eileen and Mary right behind them, and then it’s just him and Cas, alone in his mother’s kitchen, and how the hell did they even get here? One minute he was cooking breakfast, and the next—
“Dean?” Castiel mumbles, rolling off the couch and onto his feet. He sways slightly with the movement and blinks a few times before getting his bearings. It’s nearly dark out, the streetlights already glowing orange through the blinds, and the temperature has dropped considerably, but that can’t be right. What does the temperature have to do with—His expression switches from sleepily confused to grumpy as his gaze lands on the front door that’s standing wide open, and he stomps over to slam it shut just as one hundred and ninety pounds of Winchester comes barreling down the stairs.
It’s a gentle sort of thing, as comfortable in its familiarity as it is alarming, and Castiel closes his eyes and drowns in it, letting himself just exist in this perfect moment for as long as he is able. It’s something he doesn’t dare speak of but can feel with every breath. He’s more sure of it than anything else in this life, but he can’t bring himself to say so for fear that it’ll be snatched away, though he suspects Dean’s already put it out there, and Castiel would be lying if he said he wasn’t expecting the rain to come crashing down on them both as a result.
Be mine, be mine, yeah
Falling all in
Sing? That intelligent, gorgeous, kind and funny man could also sing? Did that man had no flaws at all..? Castiel nipped at his champagne as he watched him take a big gulp out of the bottle his brother offered him. „You really sure you want that stupid song?“ He heard Dean ask Sam while he flushed and covered his eyes with the bottle for a moment. „Yes that one. Please Dean.“ Yeah, yeah. No need for puppy eyes.“ Dean took another big gulp and started to tune the guitar as Gabriel proudly announced their first dance as a couple. The other guests stopped their conversations and gathered around the couple and Dean. Jack and Boomer came running to Castiel, the dog sat down next to him and his son climbed on his lap and snuggled into his arms. He pressed a kiss to his head and looked up again, only to see the eyes of a smiling Dean on him.
„Every time I see you baby I get lost
I can't see one thing wrong
And wow, that smile could end wars. He flushed and managed to smile back, hating himself for being shy as a teenager. Sam kissed Gabriels hand and got the smaller quirky man into a dancing position as Dean played a soft melody. They moved slowly as Dean started to sing, but Castiel was too mesmerized by his voice to really watch the dance. It was just a stupid romantic Popsong, but Deans voice was deep, and just as beautiful as the man himself.
Everything feels right since you came along“
More times than enough
Ooh, you know I've been alone for quite a while
„I know you are. Just want you to have fun, too. But we’re gonna dance in a few, thought I’d give you a warning. I bribed Dean to sing for our wedding dance, try not to drool on the tablecloth.“ He winked at him and walked over to Sam who held out a bottle of whiskey to Dean, who seemed a little less self secure while he nervously fumbled a guitar out of it’s case.
haven't I? I thought I knew it all
You are bringing out a different kind of me
Falling all in you“
Now I'm laying by your side
He hugged his son closer to his chest and tried to look normal. With every second he felt how he lost more and more of his heart to this man that he hadn’t even really ever talked to.
But since you came along“
Found love but I was wrong
There's no safety net that's underneath, I'm free
If I'm dreaming, baby, please don't wake me up
Between the both of us
Anytime, anytime
Dean ended the song by playing the soft melody for a moment longer before everyone started clapping. Castiel was still overwhelmed by his feelings and felt frozen. As usual, Jack brought him back to reality by asking very loudly; „Daddy, why are you crying?“ He looked at his son whose tiny hands started to wipe tears from his cheeks. „Sorry darling, I didn’t notice. I really liked the song.“ Jack beamed at him. „Me too! Dean is awesome, right dad?“ Castiel nodded fiercely and prayed that no one else had noticed just how much he had liked it. Jack laughed happily and jumped back to his feet to try to get Boomer to do a wedding dance with him as well.
How any guest at a wedding could actually enjoy themselves would always be unexplainable to Castiel. He sighed deeply and looked over to his left where his son Jack was happily eating a pice of cake, entertaining half of their table by how adorable he looked by doing so. He smiled at his son and removed a few crumbles from his sons dress shirt.
Castiel felt like crying. He had goosebumps all over his body and couldn’t tear his eyes away from Dean who stared at his guitar with the most beautiful blush on his cheeks.
Every night I'm with you I fall more in love

„So, I’m awesome, huh?“ Castiel almost dropped his glass when Dean appeared right in front of him and nervously scratched his neck. „Stupid song, but Sammy really likes it. This seat taken?“ He pointed at the empty seat next to Castiel who stared at Dean dumbfounded and managed to make an inviting gesture to the chair. „Cool. So, how come a gorgeous man like you is hiding all alone over here? You are Castiel, Gabs little brother, right? Shame we haven’t really met before.“ Castiel blushed even more and nodded lightly, unable to stop staring into Deans eyes. „He mentioned you’d be hot so I had to check you out...“ He grinned sheepishly. „Any chance a guy could hope to dance with you later?“ Castiels mouth dropped open. „You? With.. me?“ „Yeah, you down? I didn’t manage to find a date for the wedding, well thank god for that! Would have been awkward to dump a stranger at my brothers wedding to hit on the best man.“ He laughed nervously. „Err.. Yes. Yes I would like that.“ „Great! So you having a good time here? I heard you are a...“ Castiel accidentally interrupted him midsentence. „Do you know how breathtakingly gorgeous you are?“ He tilted his head and stared into Deans eyes. „There’s just no way you are also a nice person. You are a lawyer, so I guess you have to be pretty smart, your voice makes me cry, your face and your body are worth being sculpted into marble and you seem great with people. There can’t be a perfect human being. You have to have flaws.“ Dean looked shocked at Castiels speech, but laughed then. „No one ever described me as perfect.“ He smiled and put his hand to Castiels cheek. „But if you have to know, I’m pretty impulsive sometimes.“ Cas smiled at Dean as he moved closer, waited for a moment as they were only an inch apart and kissed him.
How could one man be this perfect? Castiel felt like he could see the depth of his glowingly beautiful soul while he sang and gave up looking normal. He thanked heaven for creating this song, the perfect moment and Dean himself.
It was the day of his favorite brothers wedding; he really should be happier... It wasn’t that he didn’t feel thrilled about the fact that his brother was finally settling down with the love of his life, it was just that it reminded him way to much of his own wedding six years ago. He had adored his wife Amelia and had been over the moon with the news of her pregnancy shortly after their wedding. It had been just like he had imagined how his life would go, until his beloved wife died two days after having their son. When he was honest with himself, he had been hiding himself with Jack and his work in his own little bubble, working at home and avoiding all kinds of human interactions besides walks to the playground and shoppingtrips. His brother Gabriel had always been by his side, especially while the first horrible year after Amelias death lasted and Castiel had been overwhelmed with grief and the novelty to care for an infant. But as a team, it had worked out. Then four years ago, Gabriel had found his groom. Of course Castiel had met the man that had stopped Gabriels endless affaires and had been pleasantly surprised by him. His brothers usual preferences were tall and gorgeous blonde women with great curves, Sam Winchester was the complete opposite. Well, he was tall and very handsome; but also very much a man. He was a lawyer from Lawrence that had opened his own law firm with his brother and their uncle shortly after graduating Stanford and they seemed to be pretty successful doing so. Gabriel had often tried to tempt Castiel to meet Sams family but Castiel had always declined. Meeting new people if he didn’t absolutely had to wasn’t exactly his favorite thing.. He tried to work on himself to get outside more, mostly for Jack because his son loved humanity, but still he avoided groups of people. But obviously there was no way of getting around his brothers wedding. It was a nice and rather intimate party of around fifty people, but it still felt overwhelming. Also it hadn’t really helped that Sam’s elder brother Dean was the most handsome man Castiel had ever laid eyes on. He tried not to stare at the gorgeous figure next to Sam who appeared to be very outspoken and open. As soon as Castiel had seen him for the first time this very morning, he had stopped wondering why Gabriel wouldn’t shut up about the Winchester’s. Obviously he loved Sam, but he also genuinely liked Dean, which seemed to be very fun to talk to and a true friend. Also he had played with Jack for a while and Castiels heart had melted faster than he would ever admit. But even though everyone seemed to love Dean, Castiel had felt absolutely intimidated by his beauty and had merely managed to say hello to him. He hated himself sometimes for being this bad around people, but he couldn’t help himself. When Amelia had been by his side, he had felt safer and his social anxiety had been quieter. But now that he was alone there was no getting around it anymore. He sighed again and watched how his brother listened in awe to a story Sam was telling the group. Gabriel deserved to be this happy. Being lost in his thoughts, Castiel hadn’t noticed that Jack had finished his cake and jumped happily to his feet. „Daddy, can I go over and play with Boomer, please?“ Castiel nodded at his son and smiled as the boy ran after Sams huge golden retriever. A hand appeared on his shoulder and he looked up to see Gabriel taking Jacks seat. „How are you doing, little bro? You seem lonely, buddy.“ Gabriel looked at him with his usual worried expression. Castiel really didn’t wanted him to be worried at his own wedding so he plastered a smile to his face. „It’s fine. I’m just not used to be surrounded by so many people. But it really is a nice Party, Gabe. I’m so happy for you guys.“
“If the timeline is correct there is another week before the next victim would turn up.”
“Stupid teenage body,” he mumbled as he balled his hands into fists to keep from touching himself.
The shapeshifter fell to the floor. Its head rolled in one direction and the body slumped in another.
It was late on the third night and Cas was restless. He’d found himself in the kitchen and eating. Dean appeared a little while later.
Dean pulled into the motel parking lot and cut the engine. He let out a deep sigh and closed his eyes.
“Are you sure that you want to do this Dean?”
"Love you too," Dean mumbled as he drifted off to sleep.
to do with the angel. It was just a warm body. A really warm body. So warm and hard against him. Cas had held him down like it was nothing.
“It was going to be a surprise. Then I thought you needed some good news. I was gonna wait until you reported to the dorms and saw me there.”
Sam slapped the collar around Lucian’s neck.
“Let’s eat before all this amazing food that Eliot helped prepare gets cold or warm depending on which foods they are.”
Cas gasped and clung to Dean’s hips as he began to grind down on him.
Dean cleaned them up then they were back in his bed cuddled together.
Cas knew that it was a possibility.
Dean chuckled and pulled him in for a kiss, “yeah you’re definitely my boyfriend.”
Dean got to the apartment and Cas was still there thankfully.
“Oh no,” Cas facepalmed, “I should’ve known. He’s always very affectionate when he gets intoxicated as well. I should’ve warned you.”
“Yes.”
Cas looked down at their hands then to Dean’s eyes and back.
“Thank me with a date to that burger place on Fifth.”
They didn’t drop their weapons. Cas was pretty sure he heard some of them charge. No bullets. It would be tougher for him to heal from a laser blast.
Cas enjoyed his time in the Winchester Campbell territory. They spent two days with preparation. The night of the second Rowena and Cas removed the warding from Jack. Nothing had happened. The third day had been more preparation and lookout.
Cas kissed him again.
“Always and forever.”
“Decapitation kills anything but you’re not going to have the chance to--”
In a flash, they were on the bed undressed. Cas kissed Dean deeply as he stroked him slowly. Dean whined into his mouth as his hips bucked up. Cas sped up his hand.
Dean hugged him. As soon as all Castiel’s arms were wrapped around him he felt home for the first time he could remember.
They sat on the porch for a little longer until the humidity got too much.
A man a little taller than Cas and extremely handsome approached them. His face was pleasantly neutral.
Cas stood over the leader with the end of his staff pressed to his throat. He could feel the blood from the others drip down his face.
Cas pulled the necklaces from under his shirt. He tapped each of them. He called forth rain. He wasn’t powerful enough for a full storm. He only needed a little rain so it didn’t matter. He touched the bracelet on his wrist and the glamour fell away. It wouldn’t matter where he was going. His periwinkle skin, sharp teeth, and pointed ears wouldn’t be out of place.
Dean explained.
“Okay. I would like to sleep. It took a lot of grace that first hour before it started to sip. Then flying the others to safety. I will need to sleep.”
. It just isn’t my thing. I remember we had a really good time. I remember that that was one of the first times I realized I might actually love you for real for real.”
Lucian fell.
Dean stood slowly and looked at the creature.
“Enough. Fix me,” Dean pouted.
The leader laughed, “do you know where you are? This is Winchester Campbell territory. We are the finest warriors of the realm. There are six of us and one of you. There is no challenge here.”
“As I’ll ever be.”
“My son is missing. Someone has taken my son and,” Cas caught himself.
“I shouldn’t have let you touch me yet. Come we must go. Your transformation is starting. Grab your things.”
“Bottom. I said I wanted to bottom since I hadn’t in a while,” Dean crawled up and got in position, “gotta make it good since I won’t be able to for a while.”
Dean’s flames grew.
To Lucian’s eyes, Dean had just slit Jack’s throat.
“But now I won’t need to anymore. I’ve got everything I need right here. Stronger. Better,” it cackled and shifted into a normal human, then a cat, a horse, Cas, and back to a human.
Once Jack was safely in bed that night be went to Dean’s chambers. They had already talked about and Cas wanted to be there. They headed down to the dungeon together.
“Feels so good Cas. Fuck.”
Dean looked Lucian in the eye, “one last chance.”
“My wee lad. Aren’t you just adorable?” Rowena grinned and pinched his cheeks.
“This is so great!”
“I’d wait a million years. Having you here is more important than that.”
Cas jumped when the gunfire started. Dean pulled him behind their armored vehicles out of the line of fire.
“You did this to yourself,” Dean said and let Cas’ body go.
“As you would have it.”
“Okay so like we can do full sex later but I really need you to get me off like right now. Please.”
“Did…did we just have sex?” Dean panted.
“Of course. Thank you.”
Cas made lunch and they settled down in front of the TV and watched one of the videos Kelly had made for them.
“Yes. There are certain spells that call for organs, the blood of children, and sacrifices that can create longer life. Using the organs of otherworldly creatures, makes the spell more powerful. It hadn’t even occurred to me as no one uses those spells any longer. No one wants to live forever anymore.”
“He needs to sleep. We won’t get up to anything.”
“Was worth a try,” Dean went around to the driver’s side.
“Good. We ain’t losin’ people this go ‘round,” Dean sat on the other side of the desk and read over the notes that Cas had left.
“Yeah okay. But that was great. I feel really good.”
Cas grabbed up his coat as soon as they let go of each other. They took the chains. Cas vaporized the remains of the shifter and they headed to the car.
Dean’s eyes went wide.
Cas sat on the opposite side so that he could look at Dean, “so.”
Dean wrinkled his nose and groaned as he smacked his lips. His eyes fluttered opened and he looked around.
“Thank you Dean.”
“The body is made up of water. A large percentage. Over half in some people.”
“Can I come back to the room?”
“I know. I miss her very much too.”
“I was wrong, okay? I should’ve spoken with you before it got outta hand.”
“I look forward to it.”
“I’m not a criminal right?” Dean started to walk through the house and put a few things in a box he had by the side door.
“Love you so much,” Dean mumbled as he drifted.
Dean nodded.
The potion was disgusting but 12 hours later he was back to middle-aged Dean. He folded way the clothes Sam and gotten him to wear over the last four days. There was a knock.
“There’s nowhere you can ever go that I won’t find you, Dean Winchester.”
“I’ve got ninety minutes then I’ll have to leave. I can’t remove my mask but I will,” he glanced at the door, “give you kisses in our special way.”
“Otherwise how are we supposed to have all that sex that you were talking about before?” Cas slapped his ass.
“Don’t go. I’m sorry,” Dean walked over to him, “I was wrong. I shouldn’t have yelled at you. I definitely shouldn’t have thrown the dirty socks at you.”
“We gonna do that a lot,” Dean mumbled as he drifted to sleep.
“I was worried you wouldn’t know to look for me.”
Cas rolled his eyes, “two things. One, you’re getting your gallbladder removed. Nothing serious. The mortality rate is so low. Secondly, I am an angel. I would bring you back.”
“You should’ve listened.”
At the car, they checked over the kids then Cas flew them home. He returned and took the werewolf home. Dean hugged him again before they got in the car.
Cas pressed his lips together and nodded.
Cas had spent more and more time with Dean throughout the time there. There was something about the prince that drew him in. He wasn’t like other fae royalty. He didn’t embrace his fae side. Because he had a mixed heritage he didn’t have powers like Cas. He could move things with his mind and control water as his element. That was it. Cas understand wanting to live a normal life so he didn’t fault Dean at all.
“None of the other kids are missing? Just Jack?” Cas asked.
“No. This is your execution.”
Dean raised his hand and waved.
“You must be the husband,” the nurse chuckled as she entered the waiting room they’d set Cas up in while Dean went through the gallbladder surgery.
They worked late into the night. Dean was about to call it a night when something caught his eye when he went back over the photos from other hunters. He jumped up.
“Oh. My package from Amazon finally came. I got my new clothes. You have been adamant that I change my look. Now that I have a place to stay I can put clothes in a dresser and not have to worry about what will happen to them.”
“I’ve sent him the relevant updates. I left out the fact that you relayed very erotic details of our lives to the recovery staff.”
“What?”
“I will return shortly.”
“I can get another room when we get back,” Sam said as they hit the road.
Dean didn’t know how long he’d hid but when he was back and calm, the sun was a lot lower in the sky. He needed to head home before his mom worried too much. Being in the woods at night was not safe.
Cas had never had a full blush in his entire existence but he was sure he was red in the face as his face warmed significantly, “understood.”
“What?” Dean sputtered and tried to move away but Cas grabbed him.
Cas dropped the fork and yanked up the tickets. He looked at Dean then back at the tickets.
Cas wasn’t sure how it happened but he was there with Dean in bed. He kissed down his chest as he slowly pushed into him.
“What?” Cas asked as he stopped next to Dean and started to rinse the dishes.
“The police are headed here. We’ve already let them know.”
“I promise I won’t harm you or Jack. Castiel I need to draw Lucian here.”
“Yes love.”
Dean felt his face warm and he stepped back and let Cas’ hand drop.
“I’ll try not to.”
“Hmm. Love you. Thank you for being here. I know Sammy wanted to.”
“I’m glad you didn’t. This is way better. We can drive up together.”
Cas smiled.
“It was the thought that you almost lost me. Your brain pumped chemicals and your mind reacted. You didn’t want to lose me without telling me you loved me. In the height of the adrenaline and fear you spoke your truth.”
“Can you shrink down? Being like eight feet tall will kinda not fit comfortably in my house,” he looked around, “and we should definitely get inside. Can you also turn your ship’s light off?”
“You, uh, like, where’s your tax accountant look?”
“So much better. Why’d you wait until the spell was over?” Dean turned over to face him as they got comfortable.
The rain cloud vanished. The early autumn sun beamed down and a rainbow jumped up. With a flick of his wrist, the staff extended to its full size.
“Oh,” Castiel looked away and his cheeks dusted purple, “I am your betrothed.”
Once they were outside of the cement tunnel and stood next to each other Dean threw his arms around Cas.
“Oh,” Sam said a few minutes later.
“And if I ever hear my mom’s voice I should run?”
“Fuck yes.”
“I kinda like you a lot too.”
Dean helped Cas sit up. He hugged him tight and let the stress melt away as the angel returned the hug tightly.
Dean recognized the engravings on the chains. They mirrored the ones on the cuffs they had. He’d be taking them with him.
“And why I had to change my name to your last name?”
“Come in,” he said without turning around.
Cas watched as Sam and Rowena edged to the side of their shields. He didn’t watch long. He didn’t want to give away their location.
He leaned and pressed a kiss to Cas’ cheek. It had taken over a decade but it was worth it to be there.
“Let’s let him sweat it out a little bit. He shouldn’t have blabbed your secret.”
Cas reach up with his other hand and cupped Dean’s face, “I love only you. No matter how many people flirt or make advances, I only have room in my heart for you. You are my one and only. You give me everything that I need. I am in a fulfilling relationship with a funny, compassionate, charming, hardheaded but loving man.”
“Twink?”
“Papa Cas!” Jack rushed to Cas.
Dean rolled over and clung to Cas afterward. After multiple orgasms, Dean turned into a cuddler. Cas snapped and they were clean.
<<<>>>
“Prince Dean needs me to reach out to dad that had lain with mom.”
Sam jerked up from where he’d slumped over on the desk, “huh?”
The signature was the same but the evidence left behind was different. There couldn’t be multiple creatures with the same habit. The only consistency was the claw marks. One scene had feathers left behind. Another some sort of scales. The humans have been working each a separate case for an animal attack.
“I’ll work on being neater.”
“I’m sorry Mr. Collins. We don’t know what happened. The authorities are on their way.”
“I cannot risk you coming for my son again,” Cas held up a scroll, “writ of execution already signed.”
Dean made a spread. Everything he loved and foods that he wanted Cas to try. He’d called Eliot to get his help with a few things. He’d shown up and helped him make them. He had had Parker take Cas out to distract him. It could be one of his last nights on earth and Dean wanted to make sure that he enjoyed it. While Eliot had finished up he’d run to take a shower. Eliot of course had gone above and beyond with presentation. He sent a prayer up to Cas and a moment later he was there.
“Heya Cas.”
Cas grinned. He got on his knees and leaned into Dean’s space.
“Oh hush. No one is gonna even know it was me.”
“Love you.”
“It’s my last supper.”
Hundreds of hands were in the air and everyone began to sing. She went to the edge of the stage and started to sing to the crowd. They had made it to the second verse of ‘Fool’, a third song, when the power returned. Nostalghia stood on the edge and waved then went back to singing when the instruments picked up.
“H-how did you know that I would be coming?”
If there hadn’t been claw marks and reports of unnaturally large shadows Dean would have thought the killings were just a human serial killer. They had been to each morgue in the area that had a victim and it was awful. Cas had done a wonderful job in getting all the details for them. The legwork had been done. They just had to do a little research to figure exactly what it was.
He heard someone call after him but it was too late. He couldn’t face them. Him. He couldn’t face
“Okay.”
“I think that I should
Cas didn’t look back. He took to the stairs. With a wave of his hand, he was clean. When he entered the building there was a redheaded woman with a glowing smile and dragonfly wings.
“Twinks not do it for you?” Dean laughed.
Dean had finally invited Cas to stay with them in the bunker officially. He wanted his entire family close. Mary came and went as she pleased but everyone else pretty much was always there if they weren’t on hunts. Between the bunker and Jody’s all the people he loved were settled down.
Dean squints at the guy in front of him and waits, but it looks like Gabe’s waiting for actual confirmation before he keeps going. “Okay?!”
It’s been steadily snowing for hours now, and where there were signs of other cars earlier in the day, there are now only white dunes piled between a black ribbon road and gently bent pines. In the silence, snowflakes continue to fall onto Baby’s windshield and melt against the glass.
They pull back and share a heavy look before Dean stutters out a, “What?”
After Castiel watches her go, his hands curl into fists, and he turns on his heel, intent on giving his older brother a piece of his mind, but he’s met with a familiar face that instantly causes his anger to fizzle out and die. “Dean.”
There’s a pregnant pause, and in the back of his mind, Castiel thinks for just a moment that Dean will take this opportunity to get out of marrying him, but then Dean’s lips lift in a miniscule smirk, and Dean clears his throat. “Well, the government is gonna have to deal with some more paperwork because I don’t care what they say. I’m marrying Cas anyway.”
He snorted and shook his head. Those two were practically joined at the hip these days, but as far as Sam knew, neither had taken that first step toward something more. Ridiculous if you asked him. Love like that was rare for anyone, but for a hunter to find someone special, someone not only willing to work through the rough patches but could also hack the life, was, well, practically impossible. Yet Dean had.
sag a bit before blinking rapidly to clear the sudden moisture from his eyes. “Yes,” he whispers, grinning like an idiot. “We’re okay.”
“Dean—”
When she’s gone, Dean rests his arm over the back of his seat and studies his friend. Cas has loosened up a ridiculous amount since their escape, and his eyes aren’t early as red as they were, but there’s still a hesitancy to his smile, and Dean presses the toe of his shoe against his shin. “How you doin’ over there, angel?”
Castiel falls into a heap on the other side of the rock wall encircling the courtyard and backs up to the stone before pulling his knees up to his chest. Stupid, he was so stupid. He really believed in—he thought that—
“Out,” came the inflectionless reply.
Unconsciously, he leans into his wife—
be what Castiel thinks it is. “Dean—”
“There’s been some reshuffling with the seating, and I felt it pertinent to confirm you’ll be coming alone before moving your placement.”
The kitchen is his favorite part of his mom’s house, and it’s not only because of the memories he has here. Dean’s always enjoyed cooking. There’s a weird sort of peace to be found in the repetitive motions of mixing or kneading or shaping various foods, and it takes less thought than fixing an engine requires. Really, it’s more instinct than—
Dean rolls his eyes and mutters something about Wendy Peppercorn under his breath before shrugging. “Uh…Oh!” He snaps his fingers and rolls his lips between his teeth, holding them there for a few moments before jumping up and striding toward Bartholomew with his nose in the air. “You’ve got a lot of nerve,” he says once the old butler’s gaze lands on him.
Dean turns the chair and straddles it, folding his arms across the back and settling his chin there as he watches Ellen go back to her game, and it’s quiet for a while, just the sounds of her cards shuffling against each other in the early morning light filtering through the front windows, but every so often, Dean catches her glancing at him, and the silence grows heavier until Dean can’t take it anymore.
“Stubborn? He’s been slipping Home Depot flyers into my purse and car since last spring. He thinks it’ll convince me to let him do the bathrooms first, but I’m not giving in just yet. When I’m ready, I’ll present my case, and I never lose. After all, I learned from the best.”
Gentler than he was with his own door—and with a subtle caress to the chrome which Castiel perceives as an apology to his beloved Baby—Dean opens the passenger side and pulls Castiel to his feet. “Ready?” he asks, a cocky grin plastered across his face.
Those three words are overwhelming, and at hearing them, Castiel
“For being Dean Winchester.”
She appears with a large smile and places two tiny boxes on the counter. Opening one, she turns it around and slides it over before moving on to the next one. “Both are fourteen carat, white gold, as promised.”
“And they say chivalry is dead.”
“Castiel,” he greets before his eyes briefly flick to Dean. “You look like you’re on a mission of some kind.”
“Nah, man, you can’t be serious.”
okay, too. He shouldn’t be nervous. Hell, it’s not like the rings actually mean anything. And, okay, maybe he spent a little more on them than he admitted to, but he figures they can either pawn them later or wear them on their other hands or something.
Cas slurs out a complaint or two when Dean pulls him upright, but he allows him to slip his arm around his waist and haul him to his feet. “Deeeeeannnnn,” he moans, gripping Dean’s jacket and throwing them dangerously off balance. Luckily, Dean is able to catch himself on the bar before Cas’s weight can throw them both to the ground and flashes his card at the bartender. “Dean, I was ‘aving funnnnn. He’s so swee’, Dean.”
him from such an attack—before Katie came along, she taught self-defense classes at the local gym, and she’s put him on his ass more times than he can count—but his instincts scream for him to cover all his bases just in case. It’s irrational, sure, and yet he can’t help but reach out and link his hand with hers, and just like that, his mind clears.
Castiel goes through his morning routine quickly, devouring a muffin in record time and washing it down with his coffee before placing a steaming mug on the table at Dean’s head and jumping in the shower. Like yesterday, when he exits the bathroom, Dean is awake, but this time he’s leaning against the headboard, sipping the coffee Castiel provided casually, his eyes only half open and hair flattened to one side.
“Better now. Come on back. I’ve got your booth saved.”
Cas’s jaw snaps shut with an audible click.
The crowd disperses quickly, a few people lingering in the rows of folding chairs but most heading out of the cold as soon as possible, so it only takes a few moments for Castiel to make his way over to Dean. They join hands as soon as they’re within reach, and Dean pulls Castiel toward him, twisting their arms together at his side.
“Hey, Ellen,” Dean sighs into her hair, hugging her back just as tightly. Few people could come so close to eliciting the same feelings in Dean as his mother, but seeing as how Ellen knows Mary better than just about anyone else on the planet—the two have been thick as thieves since second grade—there’s no one else he’d call his second mother. “How’re things?”
Slinging an arm around his friend’s shoulders, Dean pulls Cas close to his side. “You’re gonna have to quit, Gabe. I think you’re making the Mr. jealous.”
Dean stops in his tracks, gasping loudly and pointing at Cas. “You take that back.”
Cas’s low rumble drags Dean back to reality, and he surfaces amid gasps of air, blinking back tears and pressing the heel of his free hand to his chest. “I’m fine,” he mumbles, more out of reflex than anything, and judging by the way Cas’s eyebrows quirk, the dude doesn’t believe a word of it but wisely says nothing.
Hand in hand, they sneak in through the service entrance—because yes, in Castiel’s family that’s a thing—and dodge the bustling waitstaff as easily as when they were kids. While he can't do much about his family, Castiel can keep Dean from arriving at the front door. Bartholomew is at the swinging door of the kitchen scrutinizing every platter before dismissing the unacceptable and waving through those deemed fit for consumption, and it’s a wonder he hasn’t yet spotted the couple crouched behind a dozen bottles of champagne, but he’s likely too busy berating the servers for their, in his words, “despicable scraps they call uniforms.”
He’s still scared out of his freaking skull, replaying their conversation over and over in his head, and Cas is acting like he’s not sure what to do next once they’re back in the room and staring at the bed like a couple of nervous teens, so Dean takes a breath and reaches across the space between them to give Cas’s hand a gentle squeeze. Grinning, he jokes, “You a top or bottom?”
“Ooh, and we could move into the pool house ‘til the end of the holidays.”
“I’m impressed,” Castiel says once they’ve melted into the crowd.
Ellen cracks a small smile at that and kicks out the chair across from her. “Needed something to keep me busy.”
Dean swallows and nods, and Castiel has to blink away the moisture in his eyes so he can watch the myriad of emotions flit across Dean’s face. “Are you sure?” Dean rasps. “I’m not—I’m not worth it, Cas. I’m nothing.”
Gabriel hums, and the two men sit quietly until the older Novak cocks his head to peer up at the trees. “You know what, Cassie? I think today is your lucky day.”
Thoughts? Comments? Constructive criticism?
(See the end of the chapter for
“Fine,” Castiel manages, the syllable hardly escaping his lips. He’s dreamt about this moment, about the reckoning he would surely face from his childhood friend, about the judgement those soft brown eyes would surely hold if they ever met his own again, and
“Ow!”
“Yeah, yeah.” Dean rolls his eyes with a shrug. “I’m a pig with no table manners. Either sue me or shut up and eat.”
He’s jerked from his thoughts by the all too familiar squeak of the Impala’s door, and he makes his way through the thinning woods to where the grass meets the road. Dean’s standing there, one elbow on the roof of the car while the fingers of his opposite hand curl tightly around her window frame, and his face, just as painfully beautiful as it was the last time he saw it, is slack, eyes wide and lips parted, and Cas cracks.
After clinking the necks of their bottles a second time, they stretch out in their chairs and let loose mirroring sighs of contentment. For just a moment, as Castiel closes his eyes to the desert sun, letting it warm his skin and deepen his tan, he can forget the drama about to descend on his life. After all, that’s why they booked this trip, so he could relax before seeing his parents for the first time since college graduation. Here, side by side with his best friend, he can forget the judgement about to weigh heavily on his shoulders. Here, he can be at peace.
!” The breath rushes out of him as Naomi hits him with a too tight squeeze, and he gasps a little.
Mary has just enough time to appear shocked before Dean is pulling her into his arms, and as they begin to sway, Castiel drops the needle on the old record player in the corner. Zeppelin II crackles through the room, and if anyone ever asks, Castiel will blame the stove for the warmth that creeps up his neck when Mary sniffles.
“Listen, angel, she adopted you about thirty years ago, okay?” Dean cups a hand around his mouth while stage whispering, “Get used to it.”
“What kind of fight?” Sam prodded.
His near freak out comes back to him then, and Castiel blinks, caught off guard by the extreme hits his feelings have taken in the last several minutes. “I’m sorry about that. I—” Castiel sighs, running a hand through his hair in frustration, and he’s about to ignore their almost kiss like all the drunken kisses they Do Not Talk About in favor of finding a strong drink to knock back when his eyes land on a very rosy cheeked Michael making his way down the stairs with another man at his side. Immediately, Castiel’s anger is back, and he glares at his brother. “I need to have a word with Michael.”
Beside him, Dean rolls over and burrows deeper into his pillow, his brow furrowing. “Go to sleep, angel,” he murmurs. “You’re thinking too loud.”
Ellen’s wide-eyed, absorbing the details of a local shopkeeper hungrily. “What happened?”
“You were a mistake,” Naomi hisses, leaning forward. “I never wanted you, and if I could, I would’ve aborted you as soon as I realized God wouldn’t save me the trouble. The
“Oh yeah?”
“Dean.”
“You don’t,” Castiel says, unzipping his garment bag. “As I’m the one in the actual wedding party, I’ll be in a tux, but I packed your blue suit with the green tie for today.”
is what we get? You, pretending your breath is cigarette smoke?”
So, while Mary and Dean reminisce between the refrigerator and microwave, Castiel keeps an eye on the snickerdoodles and pulls them out when he’s pretty sure they’re done, and he bags the icing so it’ll be there when Dean is ready to decorate the gingerbread, and he runs a sink full of soapy water and scrubs pans until Led Zeppelin spins out and Dean appears at his side, dishtowel in hand.
Castiel gasps and uses Dean’s arms both to steady himself and to make sure that this is real, that it’s actually happening and not an elaborate daydream stemming from a particularly bad fall on a patch of ice, but he doesn’t wake up to the others staring down at him—not that waking up with Dean hovering over him would be a bad thing—and he’s not in a hospital bed, so it must be real, and if it is, well, Castiel is only human, and it feels better than anything else he’s encountered in this lifetime, so he holds on, hugging Dean to his chest and returning the kiss. Dean releases a surprised sound from the back of his throat, and Castiel greedily swallows it down as his brain short-circuits.
Sam snickered and stuffed his hands in his pockets before ambling back to his room, confident the two losers in the kitchen would be just fine.
Sam splutters around the mug of coffee Mary dropped into his hands and lays a hand on his little girl’s shoulder. “No, sweetheart. He, um, well, he…”
It’s a clear dismissal, and Castiel spears a piece of roast with a bit more force than is strictly necessary as conversation continues to be about the upcoming wedding. It’s not that he isn’t interested in the topic—the opposite, actually, as he’s thrilled Gabriel finally found someone who can match him shot for shot and keep his ego from overinflating. The issue is that between his mother actively engaging Kali and pretending that they’re best friends when everything he’s heard from Gabriel couldn’t be further from the truth and his father’s outburst, Castiel’s on edge.
Castiel can’t help but smile back as he nods. He won’t mention Dean’s ticks, and he won’t push Dean into admitting how nervous he is right now despite the curiosity gnawing insistently at his gut. Instead, he lets Dean lead him to the space between the headlights, and together they sway through a series of uncomplicated steps. Left, left, right, back, turn, again. Castiel easily catches on, and soon there’s nothing between them but music and the night as their steps take simple diversions with the occasional dip or spin that leave both men laughing, but then Dean catches Castiel’s eye and sobers suddenly. The grin on his face slips away, and they’re locked into a silent conversation, their bodies moving incrementally closer with each beat of their hearts. It’s peace and surrender, warmth and rest. Dean relaxes into him and rests their foreheads together, and it’s that simple gesture that sends Castiel soaring into the outer atmosphere.
“I’m so happy for you, Dean,” Mary whispers in his ear. Stepping back, she places a hand on his cheek, and dammit, her cheeks are wet, but she’s smiling, and that only makes his skin heat with even more shame than he initially had for lying to her. His mom winces, and she starts to say something, but the words jam up on her tongue.
Ellen showed up to the hospital not long after they'd arrived and nearly tore down the reception desk to get to them. Then, after ensuring everyone was alive and well, she gripped Mary's hand tight and told them they'd all stay with her until Sam's bunch went home and Mary got sick of her. That was... interesting to see but nothing less than what Dean's come to expect from Ellen. She'd all but adopted their bunch from birth anyway, but to think she'd offered his mom a permanent place for as long as she wanted? That went above and beyond anything he could have considered.
“Well,” Dean says, “Gabriel actually went and did it. I’m telling you, Cas, I had my doubts.”
It’s like someone dumped a bucket of ice water down Dean’s shirt.
“If you still wanna leave when I’m done,” Dean’s says when Castiel meets his eyes again, “I won’t stop you.”
It's just a kiss, and Dean’s had thousands. The stirring in his chest doesn’t mean anything because it
You all have been so wonderful with your feedback that I want to take a second to express my gratitude to you. I didn't expect half the attention this story has gotten, so it's quite literally blowing my mind to see how much you love it. From the bottom of my heart, thank you.
“Cassie?” Gabriel drops the bags he’d been carrying and approaches slowly, one hand held up and his head tilted as he gauges Castiel. “Where’s Romeo?”
Fear.
“Are you kidding? She’ll be thrilled! You know how she is.”
Castiel closed his eyes against the neon glow of the OPEN sign and braced himself on the chipped metal railing leading up the walk, his throat clicking loudly as he fought to keep his stomach contents in the correct place. Not that there’d be much to come up if he did blow chunks. Once Dean called to let him know their plans for the evening had changed, Castiel’d found himself unable to stomach even a small snack due to the wave of nerves threatening to pull him under.
been Cas. And no matter what, it’ll always
Castiel slides over and shifts until he’s practically in the man’s lap, and thanks to their earlier incident (which they still won’t discuss) he’s acutely aware of each time his fingers brush Dean’s skin. It doesn’t help, of course, that Dean keeps glancing at his face while Castiel works at the tiny button or that Dean’s lips part on a sigh once it’s done. Castiel swallows. “Got it,” he announces.
“You could say that.”
These days, marriage is all around Castiel, so much so, in fact, that he can’t
It’s stupid, but his hands are shaking a little as he goes for Cas’s ring first. “Never thought I’d be doing this,” Dean huffs jokingly. “Um, Cas, do you wanna…?”
Dean realizes a second too late he’s been caught staring at his friend as Kali is raising her eyebrows and smirking. “Sorry, what?”
“Mary’s house is on fire.”
there’s a naked body in the room because it won’t go the fuck away.
Pushing open the door, an electric bell in desperate need of a battery change buzzed loudly, and Castiel was immediately assaulted with the smells of plastic and rubber and lubricant. A bored sales associate straightening one of the shelves near the counter waved him in while her back was still turned, and Castiel caught a flash of black ink beneath her shirt before he made his way to one of the various magazine racks.
“Thanks, angel. Don’t know what I’d do without you.”
The cop glances around quickly before nodding to himself and stepping back. “You boys be careful,” he says while grabbing the radio clipped to his shoulder.
Castiel chanted in his head. “No.”
“I think that’s Lillith,” Castiel explains. “Gabriel told me she’s in charge of some of Luci’s underground dealings. He thinks it’s a sex trafficking ring, but he can’t prove it.”
“You didn’t have to do all this,” Dean murmurs thickly, swiping at his nose.
“Why didn’t you tell me?” Cas asks, his hands balling into fists as he huffs a breath.
“Squints?”
“So,” Sam says as everyone begins digging into their breakfast. The way his eyes are all lit up, Dean knows he’s about to pounce.
(See the end of the chapter for
“Dean!”
Rubbing the back of his neck, Dean nods. “You’ve had enough on your plate this week without worrying about this, too. I just wanted to help.”
“These two men are very firm in their morals, and they’d never go back on their commitments. To do so would drastically change their character arcs, and that’s nothing compared to how their own relationship would look to others.”
Castiel turns then, leaning against the doorframe so she can see his mouth better. “He’s still being stubborn?”
The conversation turns to Gabriel’s bakery then, and Dean tucks into his food while mulling over his next move, and it’s when he’s finally decided on dropping his hand to Cas’s knee that Cas runs his own hand tantalizingly down Dean’s back. Dean’s hand remains tense, almost unnaturally still, as Cas’s fingers drift down to the dip in his spine. They hesitate only a moment at the top of Dean’s pants, and then they return to his shoulder blades before making the circuit all over again.
would raise a few eyebrows from the townsfolk.”
Castiel turns Dean’s palm up and traces the lines there, marveling at the callouses and scars born of years of hard labor. So much of Dean’s life is written on his hands, and they’re just one of the many things Castiel loves about him. “You,” he continues, glancing up at Dean through his lashes, “are worth fighting for.”
The waitress lifts a skeptical eyebrow but continues on wiping down the other tables, and Dean returns to planet earth to find Cas grinning smugly. “What?” he snaps.
be what your brothers are to us,” Naomi calls as they near the front door. Dean can’t remember moving, but he must have, and now—
Running a hand through his hair, Castiel grins. “Um…slowly?”
“You ordered them already?” Cas hisses once she’s gone. He doesn’t sound angry, just confused by the new information.
Gabriel’s voice deepens here, and while the man is often a clown, he’s never once joked about his little brother’s well-being.
Just then the door is yanked open behind him, and someone pulls Cas out into the open. “Thank goodness you’re okay!” Naomi trills, wrapping her youngest in a hug. He flails slightly and then stiffens, his entire body tensing in her hold and fists clenching at his sides.
“And that was it,” Dean murmurs. He licks his lips lightly and watches as Cas tracks the movement—just like he did at the wedding, dammit—before saying, “I was a goner for him.”
“Mom?!” Sam’s already on his feet when Dean looks up, and somehow Dean finds the will not to melt onto the bumper.
“My lifestyle?!” Castiel nearly shouts. He winces and peeks into the main room, but Dean is still sprawled out and unmoving, so he gently eases the bathroom door shut. “Mother, I’m pan, not a leper. Besides, I’m the best man. I didn’t think there was ever a question as to my being there.”
Naomi’s smile falters slightly, and Kali beams behind her wine glass. “I admit, we got off to a rocky start, but—,” she covers Kali’s hand with her own, and both Kali and Gabriel stare at the woman like she’s grown a second head, “—I’ve always wanted a daughter like you.”

“Slow,” Cas breathes after Dean attempts to wriggle out of his underwear. He’s boxed in by Cas’s torso and limbs, but he’s never felt safer.
“Yep.”
Gabriel’s mouth thins, and Castiel continues, Dean’s words comparing Castiel to Naomi playing on a loop in his head. “Our friendship is over. My entire life has been turned on its head.”
Almost immediately, his phone vibrates in his palm, and he swipes across the screen.
Eventually he saw the flashing sign up ahead and blew out a slow breath while shifting the car into park. “Just a peek,” Castiel muttered, adjusting his coat. He’d gone for a layered look beneath his trusty trenchcoat in the hopes the added materials would bulk up his frame and make him appear a bit larger than the scrawny underaged teenager he was. If it came right down to it, he could always flash his fake I.D., but that was just a backup plan, a fail-safe in case he couldn’t play his part convincingly.
“You like it up the ass, kid, that’s enough information for me.”
But Dean’s not watching them or the snow anymore.
He’s just about to climb out when a hand on his arm pulls him back into the cab. “Dean,” Cas says slowly, “our rings?”
Had Castiel ruined everything?
Pulling into his usual spot, Dean presses his forehead into the steering wheel and breathes a shuddering exhale. Yeah, he’s one thousand percent aware of the friendship he gave up back there, but if it means keeping Cas safe from his family, then it was worth it, and not a damn thing will convince him otherwise. It’s better this way. Cas will move on, meet someone new that won’t hold him back the way Dean has, and he’ll forget all about him. Hell, maybe it’ll be some big-time publisher or something to catch his attention. And Dean…well, he’ll keep on keeping on.
“Uh…” Dean rubs the back of his neck and glances at Cas and then away. “Yeah. You always have.”
Dean’s expression falls, but in one swift motion, Castiel steps forward and cups Dean’s jaw, bending just enough to bring their mouths together. Dean gasps and clutches Castiel’s sleeve, and then he’s kissing back, his mouth moving firmly and purposely against Castiel’s own, and this, this is happiness. This is right and home and everything Castiel has ever wanted, and it isn’t until he tastes salt that he realizes he’s crying.
“Fuck,” Dean hisses once he pulls into the parking lot of the Roadhouse. Light is just barely seeping over the horizon, the barren fields around the bar hazy with fog, and there’s no outward appearance that makes Dean think anyone inside the building is awake.
Maybe it’s the remaining alcohol coursing hot through his system, or maybe it’s the way she says it, but something snaps inside him, and Castiel finds himself blurting, “I have a life! A good one! With my husband!”
his words, but he’s still sloshed, and it won’t be long before crying Cas makes an appearance. Pushing him onto the bed, Dean scoops Cas’s feet up and tucks the thick comforter around his body. Then he drops into a crouch and catches Cas’s wandering hand. “You’re the best man I know, Cas, and you deserve the world.”
“Dean’s getting married.”
Their laughter is interrupted by the ladder creaking, and then Dean’s head pops up through the hole in the floor. “What’re you guys doing up here?”
“Yeah, Sammy,” Dean cuts in, all but sticking his tongue out at his brother.
"What are you going to do cowboy, take away the privileges I don't actually hold? You would be lost without me." Cas said quietly in an even deeper voice than his normal one. Thankfully the other two took a hint and went back to the snacks that Mary insisted they brought with them. The voice did things to Dean, made him melt under his friend. And cowboy? Dean didn't even know that could flip a switch in his brain. Luckily, his normal flirty attitude came soaring back and he flipped Cas into the water, this time on top of him.

Cracking an eye at his older brother, Sam scoffs and shakes his head. “Fan-fucking-tastic. I’m…God, Dean. I’m just glad we’re alive.”
Dean nods once and glances over, the smile on his lips short-lived when he meets Castiel’s gaze. “Uh, thanks for the help.”
“Sammy? Hey, yeah. Yeah, man. No, I—would you shut up? I’m trying to tell you that I’m getting married.
“Did you know about this?” she asks Sam.
(See the end of the chapter for
_____________
“She’s great, uh, resting at the Roadhouse, you know?” Castiel swears he feels Dean’s entire being relax at the news, and he squeezes him tighter before Dean’s hand runs soothingly up and down Castiel’s back. “So get this,” Sam continues, “I was doing some research, and it looks like you two fall under common law marriage, so I mean, technically you wouldn’t have to go get married or anything because in the government’s eyes you already are.”
followed by a squeal and the thunder of footsteps up the stairs.
Naomi blinks, her features placid, and Castiel grinds his teeth when she stretches the pause out long enough that Dean drops his proffered hand. “And you are?”
“I had to guess on your size, and I thought if it was wrong or you didn’t like what I picked out you could choose a different one.”
“I’m aware.”
Christmas Eve, as it just so happens, is
On the rare occasions Dean’s past “relationships” lasted longer than the hour or so it took to hook up, the teasing would be a promise of things to come while they disentangled themselves from the public eye (except for the few times he managed to get freaky covertly, but that’s a whole other ballgame), but with Cas it can’t be. Sure, Dean’d been playing with him only moments before just to see if he could get a reaction out of the guy because watching him squirm in the grocery store had been all kinds of fun, but he hadn’t taken it that far and honestly hadn’t intended to do anything that wasn’t socially appropriate or whatever. It’s not like he was about to grab Cas’s di—
Longing.
The room was totally empty, the only sign of life being the characters making out on the big screen mounted to the wall. Just to be sure, Sam reached in and flipped the light. Various wrappers littered the floor around the bed, dishes were piled precariously on the side table, and it reeked of socks and sheets in desperate need of a wash, but no Dean.
“How did you guys go from friends to dating?”
Thanks for reading!
“Know who?” Mary asks, standing on her tiptoes to snag the Tupperware of cookies from the top of the fridge. She smiles around a bite and gestures over her shoulder. “Eileen gave me a break.”
“Don’t go staining my table with food coloring like you did last year!” Mary calls from the living room. She appears in the doorway, arms full of boxes, and blows a greying curl out of her eyes. “It took ages to refinish it after your impromptu food fight.”
Castiel’s stomach is too tied into knots at the moment to speak, so he just swallows thickly and nods.
Katie shrieks from her playroom upstairs right as Sam passes through the room. Catching his wife’s eye, he says, “I’ve got to run outside for a minute. Do you mind checking on Katie really quick? It sounds like she’s up to no good.”
“Get to the point,” Dean growls.
Here's hoping you all are having a good holiday season. All the best from me and mine to you and yours!
“Seriously? Mom’s on a warpath and had me clean all the food out of the pool house, Loverboy’s taken off to parts unknown, and you’re going with that?” Gabriel sighs then and loops an arm around Castiel’s shoulders, pulling him close and gentling his voice. “It doesn’t take a genius to get the gist of things, bro, but if I’m gonna help, I need to know some details, okay?”
“Yeah…”
Shaking, Dean pulls back and takes a shuddering breath before pressing a quick peck to Cas’s temple, and no one says anything—a freaking miracle, if you ask Dean—but a quick glance around the room reveals Sam casting a knowing look his way. His little brother flashes him a thumbs up to which Dean just rolls his eyes in lieu of a response.
“Dean? What do you think?”
At that, Dean cracks an eye open and glares at his brother. “Do and die,” he croaks. “Last time you took her out, you ruined her paintjob.”
“Oh, better than most.” Father Joshua leans in as if sharing a secret, and his eyes spark with mischief. “I figure the man upstairs hears enough complaints, so I try not to add to it.”
This story has been an amazing, wonderful, beautiful journey, and I'm grateful to have been able to share it with all of you. Of course, this story wouldn't even exist without my wonderful beta, Sinshine71. She's been there through all the frustration, excitement, late-night quandries, and general squeeing. Seriously, I couldn't have done it without her.
“What do you mean?”
Yeah…
Cas hums beside him, propping his chin on his fist, and smiles softly. “I wonder why she didn’t sand them down before applying fresh lacquer.”
“I don’t know…he seemed determined to break things off. He said it was never real.” Finally, Castiel meets his brother’s eyes, and he feels oddly childlike, sitting like this with Gabriel. How many times did he go to him for comfort when he was a child? How many times did he look to Gabriel for answers to life’s questions and rely on him to make everything better? Odd how, despite the changes they’ve suffered over the years, they always return to this, two brothers. “How could he say that?”
He stops midsentence, cheeks flaring as he realizes he’d just spilled everything and more to his brother. He's never told anyone about their drunken kisses, not a soul, and he's terrified of the power behind speaking about it out loud, like it'll make them mean more than they did.
“Here, as in, right beside your stinky a—” Dean flinches under Eileen’s sharp glare and quickly covers. “Ankles. Seriously, Cas, scrub ‘em once in a while, yeah? Now, get off me so I can give my sister-in-law a proper hug.”
He makes his way through the house, stepping lightly and trying not to make any noise in the predawn silence. It’s a wonder Bart isn’t waiting hand and foot on them, especially with a guest in the front room, but he figures the guy’s gotta rest some time, and it’s not like he doesn’t know this place as well as his mom’s—or used to, anyway.
_____________
Katie grows still, her face as suspicious as Sam’s when he’s onto something. Narrowing her hazel eyes, she says, “I didn’t know you take gymnastics.”
“But you just said—It’s fake, Sam! All of it!”
“Then why—”
“What are you talking about, man?” Dean grabs his phone and starts digging, and Castiel can feel the moment Dean gets it, not because of the curses he’s spewing under his breath but because of the way the air shifts, winding tight around them. “Dude, you—” Dean huffs and tries again. “You told your mom you’re
“Is this real?” Sam demands.
“Yeah, I bet he was,” Dean grunts. After he settles their tab, he steers them outside, nodding at the security team as they pass. “You gonna marry him?”
Castiel blinks, slowly taking in the seat back in front of him and the hand on his shoulder. He rolls his neck and comes face to face with a pretty flight attendant. “Sorry,” he murmurs, swiping at his mouth to clear any possible drool.
The couple shares a look, and Eileen shrugs and signs,
Cas reaches into the basket on the table—Dean’s ninety-eight percent sure it wasn’t there last night, which means someone had to have brought it over early this morning—and lobs one of the muffins to him before going back to plucking at the paper surrounding the base of his own.
Cas’s mouth drops open, and Dean takes advantage of his shock. Cupping Cas’s face in both hands, Dean leans in until their lips are almost but not quite touching and is rewarded by a shallow gasp when he swipes his thumb over Cas’s bottom lip. His breath still smells like coffee, and Dean moves closer, crowding him against the cooler and slotting their legs together. Cas is only reacting when his hands clench the back of Dean’s coat, Dean knows that, but he keeps pushing his friend until their bodies are molded to one another, and then, when Cas’s eyes flutter shut and his head tilts back, mouth searching for contact, he stops.
“No, the Muppets.” Gabriel rolls his eyes and heaves a dramatic sigh while tucking his hands into his pockets. “Yes! Kali and I set the mood and disappeared, and the two lovebirds were sucking face in no time. You’re welcome.”
“Hey babe,” Dean grinned.
“You’re willing to sit through a Nostalghia concert with me to apologize?”
“I knew it,” Dean stood on the back porch of his farmhouse giddy with excitement.
<<<>>>
“Oh you speak earth realm tongue. Much appreciated.”
“Great,” he taped the box shut and sat it down by Castiel’s feet then went to the hall closet, “I knew it was coming soon. The last few months I’d started to hear more radio frequencies and see things that were like in between worlds or something. Then the dreams started. It’s been almost a year but I was prepared,” he pulled a duffel and backpack out, “I’ll message Bobby and let him know to watch the farm.”
"Sam how do you manage that?"
"I love you too, huggybear." Dean said kissing his now fiance. They stayed at the lake just basking in their love till it got a little too chilly for their liking and made their way back to the castle, excited to share the good news.
"And that young lady with the brown hair is Lady Elisa. Her Father is Earl of Pasadena in Texas, not the one in California." Dean nodded, Elisa was good looking, he'll give her that, and she looked very kind and understanding, but he wasn't quite feeling it with her. "You know Dean, you could start looking for suitors for a relationship."
"Have you been playing Matchmaker for Sammy yet, Ma?" Dean asked as the three of them sat down awaiting the arrival of Charlie and her father.
He looked at his best friend and saw the mischievous sparkle in his eyes. "I swear to god Cas if you splash me I am disowning you and you won't be an honorary Prince anymore, got it."
"So he gets Daphne from Scooby Doo and I get Charlie?"
This is the story of the young prince and that commoner that made his way into Dean's world.
"He's already been training for Advisor, how different could it be?" Dean asked.
"I realized it much later than that, it was actually a week before my 17th birthday that I realized it." Cas replied right after Dean.
Dean saw the blue eyes roll with sass. "That's an empty threat and you know it Dean. You love me." Dean's brain shortwired right then and there and when the fog in his brain was gone he felt both wet and a pressure on his chest. He opened his eyes, which he did not know he closed, and saw the sapphire eyes looking into his emerald ones.
"Dean I am not qualified to be a King's advisor and you know that. And what girl would pick the advisor over the actual king?" Cas asked rolling his eyes at his best friend.
"I realized it the day after my 16th birthday. Charlie had been trying to get us together since then cause she apparently could 'sense the love' as she always says." Dean explained.
After the movie they moved to go help Bobby and learn the importance of town hall. Once they were done planning and setting the ballroom up and practicing the speeches they were allowed to go to bed. Just preparing for the town hall was exhausting. They passed out the moment that they fell into Dean's bed.
"I can say the same to you with blue man. What girl wouldn't want to get with the future King's advisor, second in command of the kingdom." Dean said loudly nudging Cas a little bit.
"It was like the lake had magical powers, they both fell into the water and came back nervous and when we were getting ready for dinner I couldn't find Cas and I walked in on them making out like horny teenagers, which they were-" Sam said, the last comment earned him a slap on the arm from Mary. "But I'm sure they were in love for much longer than that."
People cheered for the young couple, glad to see the young prince so happy and free to marry the one who stole his heart at such a young age. Charlie was the loudest one cheering as they walked towards the white horse drawn carriage at the end of the ceremony.
"Castiel, never in a million years did I think that scrawny kid that showed up to the castle with baggy jeans, following his father around the offices would become my best friend, well he did and I am glad he did. I am glad to have found my best friend and life companion in one, you are my everything. You've made the last 18 years of my life amazing and the last 6 years my absolute favourites and I hope to continue with you as my husband. My mom always told me that my consort was to be the person who stole my heart, and God Cas you stole it and claimed it as your own. So Cas, will you marry me?"
"Dean! The water is nice and warm, come join us!" He heard Cas say. He then heard a splash and a Charlie like shriek. Sam had pushed the princess into the water, affectively ruining the nice curls she had in her hair for the lunch today. Dean rolled up his jeans and took his flannel off, folding the blue shirt nicely up beside the towels they brought and walked towards the water.
"Can you let me finish my sentence, you overdramatic oaf." Cas said softly smacking Dean's shoulder. "I can like anyone, but I'm only attracted to people I hold a close connection with, so in layman terms, you."
And the smallest, young Jack wearing his brand new crown, with small little labradorite gems that matched his pale gray eyes that had flecks of blue and green in them. He somehow inherited Cas' perpetual messy hair with his sandy hair. The oversized crown sat crooked on his head.  He was wearing a gray tunic suit, one that matched his fathers and brother's style. He stood in front of his fathers, the only one cracking the biggest smile possible.
One time they were all at dinner, Bobby, Mary, Sam, and the boys.
"You were eight, things have changed in the past decade Dean." Sam said wisely.
"Could it be Cas?" Dean asked quietly. His eyes scared but big with curiosity. Mary gasped quietly at the question, she hadn't expected such a question. "He and I could be the greatest King and Prince consort, best friends always make the best teams, don't you agree Mama?"
After the blackmail the four walked towards the bigger dining room and had a peaceful meal. Dean and Cas slipped away after and went for a drive in the Impala around the castle grounds, listening to AC/DC and confessing their feelings. If they had that teen movie makeout session in the back of baby, who else was going to know.
"You are perfectly qualified, and who else would I rather give it to than you? And besides you are my best friend Cas, no one else I trust more than you." Dean fixed Cas' tie, straightening it a bit and stood up from his bed. "And for the girls, if Gabe can find a girl you can, you are way more respectful than your older brother is. And I think the role of second in command is hot don't you think. All that responsibility and confidence that comes with telling the king off from being stupid."
Dean was 24 when he first encountered someone disapproving of the relationship he had with Cas. It had been the King of Texas, Lady Elisa's grandfather.
"Oh and Castiel! I was talking to my good friend the Duchess of Albany, her daughter Lady Daphne is right around your age, I think she would be a wonderful girl for you." Mary said.
"Well the emerald is your favourite, so I didn't want to offend you especially since you're the only one I trust when putting that heavy thing on. Ma would just tell me how much she loved me and forget to actually place the crown on my head, Sam would drop it since his is so much lighter than mine considering his doesn't have any gems and Pops would just tell me to hurry up and 'stop being an idjit, even I place my own crown on my head boy'."
