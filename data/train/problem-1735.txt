“Because you’re in catering,” Sherlock said. “You know the event manager.”
"It gets— things— done," Sherlock protested. His breathing was ragged. He took one hand off the headboard, risking the force of John's thrusts, and wrapped it around himself, moaning at the rush of pleasure it brought. John licked his lips and spread his knees, dropping his pelvis, which changed the angle his cock was going in. Sherlock cried out, "Yes, John!"
John was already at the door, unlocking it.
“Well,” John said, admitting nothing, and made another tic mark.
"Watson—" he began, and then before I could correct him he laughed and said, "John. Do you— may I kiss you again?"
Mrs Hudson clucked her tongue and ushered John out after him.  "He's very sensitive about it," she whispered, as Sherlock did another assessing turn in the middle of the dining room and nodded to himself.  "I don’t think they took him very seriously at his last kitchen."
We were silent a moment as Mycroft took that in.
"Ta very much," John said. His hand was steady when he put the mug down on the table.
“He was taken in last night for prostitution. I need you to come in and tell the Chief Inspector he’s your assistant.”
"Because I trust you."
John stood his ground and looked up into Sherlock's face. Sherlock's lips were shaking, and his eyes were wild. "I said, don't treat it like that," he said, lowering his voice. "You want to break something, you take it outside."
Sherlock patted him on the good shoulder. "Well, you're slow, but you'll do for now."
I stroke the back of his thigh, pressing my finger deeper, and soon I can work it shallowly in and out,  fucking him as he fucks me. My mouth is stretched wide, his cock just touching the back of my throat when he thrusts in.
"Are you ready to go back to New London?" it asks, holding the door of the vehicle open for me. "Lestrade awaits."
"I'm not cooking," John said, "so I'm not getting in your way."
"You do take such good care of me." He laughed again. "What a treat, to have something so simple arise just when I needed it. How ever did you know?"
"Ah, John," he whispered.
I let my free hand wander, mirroring his caresses of me, passing my palm up his ribs and down his arm, and then back. I detoured to his breast, caressing the pectoral muscle I could feel in the crook of his underarm and then cupping the flesh that swelled above it. Holmes made an approving noise in his throat, so I gave my handful a little squeeze and kissed his mouth again.
"Like we wanted."
"You chafe like no one I've ever seen under management," John protested. "At least you do in those videos."
They spent a few more minutes clearing things up and confirming start times, and then John set everyone free. The waiters took off at a breakneck speed, and the cooks left in a pack, already jovial and comfortable with one another. Molly, though, lingered, while Lestrade talked with the waiters, and John watched her out of the corner of his eye while he tidied up the table he'd stacked all of his folders on. When Lestrade finally released his staff, he turned to Molly with a wide smile of welcome and she blushed.
He pursed his lips a little, his blush deepening.
"Holmes," it calls. "Holmes!" God, how can it do that? Its voice is so like his. When it says, "Oh, for heaven’s sake," in that way he used to, I almost smile.
I finished my breakfast and left Holmes the portion I'd expect him to eat after a successful case, but when I went over to shake him again I was met with his ashen complexion and his glassy stare.
"No, there really
Sherlock shrugged. He unlinked his fingers and slid one hand up into John's hair. He tugged John toward him; John's lips were already parted when their mouths met. His hands moved across Sherlock's back, embracing him, drawing him closer. The heat of John's palms soaked through the thin fabric of his T-shirt. John kissed with slow deliberation, as sure of this now as Sherlock was. His hair between Sherlock's fingers was soft.
It would need to be straight out of a sixth form chemistry classroom if Holmes is going to get his way. His fixation on the noughties fad of molecular gastronomy involves more than just the sous vide now familiar to most high end chefs. The kitchen at 221 is packed with machinery Holmes brags is second-hand from Bart's Hospital, including a centrifuge for separating solid particles from liquid, a freeze dryer, and buckets of agar and xantham additives. If you prefer food that tastes like a penicillin experiment, 221 can deliver.
"We can switch," Sherlock offered, breathless.
“Ugh,” he groaned, but he let me pull him off the settee. We stumbled to the bedroom and undressed with very little regard for where our clothes landed. Holmes even wiped himself clean with his shirt before discarding it. The lamp was still burning in the sitting room, so I made the monumental effort to go turn it out.
"Do you want my mouth?" I murmured in his ear.
"Where do you want us?" John asked.
"Yes, you seem to be recovering quite well, given the extent of your injuries; your hand hardly shakes at all. Is the grip strong enough for you yet, or are you still working on it?"
Mycroft went, smirking with satisfaction. He lifted his umbrella to John in a little salute on his way out the door. John locked it behind him.
"You won't be reliant on me," I protested. "You've got on just fine without me for twenty years. What do you need me for?
I thought for sure he was going to say 'impossible', but now I saw there was some room for persuasion. Frederick Jennings was a good man, and not susceptible to bribes of money, but he did like the idea of a little fame.
He reached out for the notebook and began thumbing through it, muttering to himself. His blush had intensified. I leaned down, giving him warning by breathing out gently against the back of his neck, and then kissed him there where his hair was softest. He tipped his head forward a little in welcome, so I kissed him again, letting my lips linger. He let out a little breath. His skin was warming beneath my lips, and as I dug my teeth in I felt him tilt his hips back against mine.
“Say it,” he demands, and fits our pricks together again. “You don’t need to drag me into a toilet and spill your seed on me to tell everyone I’m yours.”
My heart stuck in my throat. I tried again, knowing it would be futile, "I wish you'd come home with me."
"Tonight?"
Laughing, I bent and licked him. His exhale hissed out between his teeth and his hips jerked. I sucked his nipple into my mouth, laving it with my tongue; I massaged the swell of his breast, kneading it with my fingertips. His spine arched as he pressed himself against me, his breath coming short and sharp. I pulled back to admire my handiwork; against his pale, unblemished skin, his nipples were rosy and gleaming damp. In the cool air they were tight little peaks. Holmes was blushing down his chest, and his flat stomach heaved.
He thrusts into his hand more than he strokes us, and our mingled excitement slicks his way. My knees are weak, and I tip my head back against the door. His teeth dig into my throat, beneath my ear. His other hand works its way under my waistcoat, shirt, and vest to my skin, and his broad palm on my belly stokes the fire within me.
"I'm sorry to have worried you," he said. "I was being foolish last night."
The crowd itself looked a little thin and unintimidating; they didn’t keep the hardened criminals out in the open like this. They also looked a little annoyed I’d just called them ‘abominable.’
. Don't be upset!"
"What else have you got?"
“In those shoes?” Sherlock muttered.
I put the telegram aside and caught sight of the books once more.
I am frozen, the grief as raw as it ever was. I cannot allow the emotion to escape. I spent my emotions when I buried him.
"I'm certain not," Watson muttered.
Sherlock hadn't planned that far, but his body seemed to like the sound of that idea. He said, "Definitely bed," in a voice he knew would make John quiver, and climbed off John's lap.
"Yes. John! I said, don't let him in."
"Eat with me?"
No, he would almost certainly enjoy that.
Now convinced there was hope for me, I still didn't know how to proceed. He was grieving the loss of his wife, and at the same time admitted to being unsettled by my return. We fought; he was more raw than I'd seen him before. He almost moved out again, but I begged him to stay. I imagine that was the first time I let him see how much I needed him in my life.
Hypothesis: he wanted me in return. He'd wanted me before tonight, before this past week, before we were married. Further hypothesis, although thinking about it felt like looking into a bright light: he had wanted me for quite a while.
"MacDonald rubs me the wrong way," John said.
"I know," I said. "What can I do?"
"Good, good." He paused, chewing his lip, and then he said, "I thought perhaps we could go for a walk, if you're amenable."
I shut my mouth.
"I love this man, vicar. I want to honor him with a commitment."
The machine raises an eyebrow. “Almost everything.”
That made him laugh, but it also had the desired effect in that he knelt up between my legs and slipped his hands beneath my thighs. I lifted my heels, pulling my knees towards my ribs, and he let out a slow breath as he parted my buttocks. I almost couldn't watch his face, so naked and unguarded was his expression. He licked his lips and dug his teeth into the lower one, his eyelids heavy with desire and his aim true. He sank into me carefully, meeting little resistance, and bent over me to kiss me with not a lot of finesse. I was full of him, aching with the stretch, and I cradled his head between my hands as we kissed. When he shifted his weight, it punched a little gasping breath out of me.
Mycroft didn't look at him. He was staring intently at Sherlock, trying to communicate with him without speaking. John didn't know why he bothered; Sherlock wasn't even interested in a verbal conversation, let alone a telepathic one.
"You do tend to get involved," I laughed.
"No, I want to—"
"When you said I was brilliant," Sherlock went on, "and that you were honoured."
"Good heavens, sir, the floor!"
"There's no use in that," I said. "What's done is done, and there's no changing it."
He'd just poured the primer paint into the tray when Harry arrived.
"It'll be interesting to see what they've got in mind," MacDonald said, the wind taken out of him.
Sherlock's laugh rumbled through John's chest, and he hugged John tightly, burying his face in John's hair. When he let go, John leaned back and gazed into his eyes. Sherlock returned the gaze, his expression serious and fond at the same time.
John said nothing to that effect, however, and only gave Mycroft a tight-lipped smile as he stepped out of the doorway. Mycroft gave him another nod, raised an eyebrow significantly at Sherlock, and went out. John looked pointedly at the floor while his footsteps descended.
"The cache was found in a barn in Henborough, twenty miles north of here."
No, John took his work very seriously, and Sherlock could tell he was going to give everything he had to make the restaurant 221 a success. He was the right pick.
"We're doing it!" he declared. Then he grabbed both my hands and pulled me towards him, embracing me. With his cheek against my cheek, I heard him murmur, "You'll be stuck with me, now."
"I can't, Sherlock," John said, "I'm not up—"
He rang off, turned his head to look at John with an expression of deep dissatisfaction, and said, "This is why I prefer to text."
"Perish the thought." Sherlock turned on the stove to heat the pot. "If you cook the bacon, we'll be done twice as fast."
Watson smiled, sweet and fond, and then he kissed me on the mouth.
I rubbed his nipple with my thumb until it was stiff. Then I licked that thumb and carried on rubbing, until Holmes's hand in my hair tightened and he growled, "Just lick it, for God's sake, John."
That shut Sherlock up. He stared at John and sipped his tea thoughtfully.
"I'm managing a restaurant on the Headrow now, yeah," she said, taking a sip of her rosé. "It's a little place: Italian. Chef's a real sweetheart, and he and his wife, who actually owns they place— they're from Naples, so they're doing it right. It's a little gimmicky, big champagne bottles and bad Roman murals everywhere, but the food is good. And the pay, the pay is good."
It was like a shock of cold water. I started to sit up, but his weight kept me pinned.
Sherlock's smile, though genuine, looked painful. He shook his head, then slapped the laptop closed and put it aside. "Lay on, Macduff, but don't say I didn't warn you."
. Holmes teases me for my sentimentality, but he’s the one who has decided to learn how to bake.
Harry grabbed his empty hand, his right hand. "Don't," she begged. "She shouldn't have to come get me."
"Perfect."
"Reverend, my dear Sherlock is very private. The idea of being married in Westminster is abhorrent to him." He laced our fingers together and gazed fondly at me. Even I was almost convinced he wasn't acting. "We've wanted to be married for so long, but he won't do it where we'd have to announce it to everyone, to endure the engagement. We don't have families with whom to visit, and the expectations are quite painful. Besides, we're too well-known, you see, to do it without it becoming a spectacle."
Mrs Hudson's voice came through the heavy wood, "Mr Holmes? Inspector Richardson stopped by early this morning and left a note for you to be delivered as soon as you were awake. Normally I wouldn't bother you, of course, but..."
steal a handful of managers.”
He hauled himself up, sending another wall of water over the edge of the tub. His knees bracketing mine squeezed my thighs tight together. He was shorter than me, thank God, so his hips fit neatly to mine, his prick poking between my upper thighs, with no extra fuss. He lay himself along my spine, groaning into the back of my shoulder, and fucked me vigorously. The water surged around us; I spared a thought for the carpet, but more of my attention was focused on the man working himself to a glorious orgasm upon my willing body.
“No!” I cry. “I want Watson!”
"Nothing's on fire, John."
Crossing to hang up his coat behind the door, John said, "Is he where the money's coming from?"
Beside John, Harry was cursing under her breath. She had an immersion blender in her hand which kept getting stuck in the avocado paste that should have been guacamole by now. John suspected the avocados weren't as ripe as they ought to be—either she'd picked lousy ones, or the studio was fucking with them—but it was too late to change tack now. They were making mini tacos for this round of
"We're here now," I said, "together, and I can't wait to see what else we can do."
His cheeks flushed pink and he tipped his forehead against mine. "Yes," he said, "I want you like that." His grey eyes sparkled in the low lamplight. I stroked his cheekbones with my thumbs and kissed him again.
What was there to say? Nothing. I knew that what had transpired in that fateful room signaled the end of our friendship, but I also knew that Holmes had practically orchestrated the entire disaster. Orchestrated it to what purpose, I could not imagine.
“Yes. I recall it.” I also recalled his hot breath on my face. And his hard manhood pressing against my thigh.
“Is that really necessary?” I asked as he hung his dressing gown on the bedpost and settled in beside me. “That hidden passage is the worst kept secret in the county.”
The Irishman’s arm whipped out and held Henry in his iron grip. “And if you took a stick to me, I would take it away and break it over your witless head! Apologize to your brother now, or you will be sorrier than you have ever been in your life!” Then he released Henry, shoving him back against one of the pillars.
I admit that I had no desire to remain in London. I, too, wished to make an escape, but for my own reasons – reasons I did not share with my companion. But there were more congenial places than a remote and unfamiliar country house. And certainly more congenial methods of traveling there.
“Feel free to be bold, James,” nodded Holmes as he sipped from his glass. “Excellent blend, James. Mycroft’s liquor stock is top notch.”
“Wait a moment!” I protested. “You haven’t even begun to answer all my questions!”
It came near. Nearer...
“I know,” I said blandly. “So like a dutiful child I will be silent unless I am spoken to.”
After Final Affirmations the nurses passed out snacks. I took a packet of biscuits, but they were stale. I was going to toss them into the bin, but Arthur took them.
“No, indeed, Doctor,” said Mrs. Hudson. “They went to that nasty gaol. Cleaned out my pantry of leftovers. Mr. Holmes says Mick Wiggins and that other boy are not getting proper food. Is that right?”
“Ah!” he nodded. “Army officer. I should have guessed by the tie. Rather too formal for this lot. We do get some young Guardsmen in here, but not a lot of active duty. I thought of doing stint a few years ago before all this muck in the Middle East. Rum business.”
“No, my dear lady. I’m going away. Going... abroad. And I probably won’t be returning for a long while.” Or ever, I should have added, but I could not. The poor woman had long suffered her two odd lodgers – and now she was being left with the odder one to deal with alone.
I took a deep breath. “You mean... if I leave... him?”
“You give the poor beast no credit, Watson,” Holmes yawned. “Pack his valise – and yours! We leave early in the morning and will be there in time for supper, unless the roads are bad.” He frowned and glanced out the window. Holmes’ practical and theoretical knowledge is extensive, but weather prognostication is not one of the areas of his expertise. “It’s fair today, so I assume it will be fair tomorrow. Bright and sunny as any April day could be! Perfect for traveling.”
“I said I would do it!” Holmes barked. “And what are you doing here? You’re supposed to be sleeping in Mrs. Hudson’s parlour.”
“It’s us against them, Watson,” he maintained one evening. They were showing a film in the Recreation Area, so Holmes and I had retreated to the corner of the forlorn garden, Holmes puffing his final cigarette of the day. “We’re besieged by the mob mentality. My brother thinks I can be broken down, but he misjudges the strength of my will. Mycroft has always discounted me. It’s because I’m the younger brother.”
I had three patients in my consulting room: a man with numbness in his extremities, a woman with a nervous complaint, and a mother with a child suffering from catarrh.
“That’s a very cynical viewpoint,” said Holmes, puffing his pipe thoughtfully.
“If he is guilty, he will go to prison,” stated Holmes.
“Yes.” I followed Lovell and James next door. “I apologize to you, Lovell. I hope we won’t be a burden to the staff.”
“Sir? Oh, sir! Wait a moment!”
Little did I understand how prescient Lady Percy would prove to be. For that night at her villa on the Esquilino I met the Irishman.
But the Irishman was troubled and preoccupied. Something was happening in his empire – something ill.
“Yes,” he said. “That word is so alien to me, but it was love I wanted. Love that I desired. My tutor got into my bed and began to make love to me. But that was not what I wanted. I wanted love from the heart and the soul, not what he wished to do. I did not even know those acts existed, such was my innocence. And when I cried out and said I didn’t want to... to do that – he did it anyway.”
“Him,” Mick whispered. “Him what runs everything evil in this city. The big Boss.”
“My dog,” I interjected. Holmes was always attempting to claim a proprietary stake in Gladstone.
Yet... I found myself looking forward to the engagement. Intrigued. I’d lived too long in all-male society, first at school, then at university, then in the Army, and finally in the company of Sherlock Holmes.
“I’m afraid I don’t have the funds to pay a servant.” I paused, thinking that Holmes could well afford a manservant, but would never have one; he was far too independent. “Nor do we have room in Baker Street to keep you.”
“It was elementary detection,” he said. “When the murder of William Fisher led us to Soho and Mick Wiggins and Dilly, I knew that Moriarty was connected to it all. I was aware that Mick had been working as a renter for some time. I tried to dissuade him, but he liked the flash life, as he called it. He liked the money and he liked the sex. And he was working on and off at the assignation house in Cleveland Street, which I knew to be connected with Moriarty’s empire. Through Mick and a few of the other boys, including Dilly Mitchell and Thommie McBride, I obtained much intelligence about the Professor’s operations, which I turned over to Lestrade.”
“Where’s Mr. Holmes?” he asked guilelessly, handing me my cup. “He didn’t come home last night.”
“I believe Henry had help in his downfall,” I said. “Tell me the truth – did you orchestrate his failure? Did you drive my brother to his early death?”
“I should say.”
“Your lover?” The Irishman sneered. “Sherlock Holmes!”
“I put a hot brick wrapped in flannel at the bottom of your bed, sir,” he said. “It’s freezing in here of a night, but that’ll make it toasty as a kitchen when you get in.”
My brother, misguided fool that he was, sneered at the Irishman, which, I am convinced in retrospect, sealed his downfall. “I will judge as I will. You have made my weak-minded brother into your catamite, to his shame and mine! If I had a stick here, I would beat you with it!”
The Irishman caught me in his arms and held me. “Why did you come here? Did Holmes send you to taunt me? Because I will kill him. Perhaps not tomorrow or next week or even next year, but I will do it. His days are numbered.”
“Yes, but I can’t operate now. Not in my condition.”
His laughter echoed in my ears as I fled from the room.
Holmes’ statement on our walk had left me shaken. He’s a man who rarely expresses emotion, yet this was, for him, an emotional declaration if ever I’d heard one. I wasn’t certain how to parse it – or if I should even attempt to. Holmes is such a confounding creature at the best of times. I often hesitate to take what he says to heart. He also lives to vex me, mainly because he can. Yes, he plays me like he plays his damned violin – sometimes with such sweetness it stirs my soul, but other times with a discordance that makes me want to punch him in the jaw!
“Yes, my dear lady, and I know you will do what you can to aid us in his case. And that means seeing to the comfort of his beloved pet.” Another yowl issued from the box. “I will carry her downstairs.”
“Ever so light-headed,” he said. He touched his long yellow hair, which was tangled with filthy straw. “I must look a fright.”
I ate a piece of cake and choked down my sugary drink and then begged off, having the excuse that I needed to pack. They all sincerely wished me well and I was touched. There had been no similar send-off for Arthur, who intimidated most people with whom he came into contact, or for another man who had left the week before. I realized, to my surprise, that they had a party because they liked me. They believed me to be a success and were truly happy for me.
Something.
All the world – with two exceptions. My father and my brother could not stand the sight of me.
“But...”
“Delightful woman,” said Holmes as we roared off, the cab attempting to follow. “The hours must fly by with her in the room.”
“Of course,” said Holmes. “Anything else?”
“I don’t know,” Holmes sighed. “I wish I did know, but I don’t.”
“Florence? But we met in Rome,” I said, confused.
“Yes. An empire – of crime.” His eyes closed as he remembered. “And this thrilled me. He spoke of the world that existed underneath London – a world of money and excitement and power. He said we would be mightier than the police, more influential than the government. We would rule London, and then England – and beyond. He said nothing was beyond our grasp. And he stroked me and kissed me and drew me in more and more each day. And then... my grandfather sent word that he was returning to Sherringford from Paris. My tutor urged me to run away with him. He said he cared for me and we would hide where the old man would never find us. We would always be together. But first...”
Mrs Hudson frowned. “A message?”
“I don’t see what is so disgraceful about it,” Holmes said with confounding calm. “It is mere biology. A physical function. That society deems such deeds as either moral or immoral is a quirk of the era. The shame is that some children of the lower classes are forced into such occupations, while so-called gentlemen are obliged to pay to observe them, instead of each man being free to couple as he will – if that is his desire.”
“He refused to go to one,” Mycroft explained blandly. “He was wounded in St. James’ Park, apparently, and walked from there. By the time he reached the club, he’d lost a fair amount of blood.”
“It doesn’t,” I replied. “But it is not a pleasant memory.”
“No,” he said, gazing at me with his piercing eyes. “I am not. In the London Underworld he is known as the Professor. But I know him by his true name – James Moriarty.”
The footman nodded. “I understand. Thank you again, sir.”
I discarded the glass and proceeded into the main salon. It was packed with more poseurs, mixed in with respectably fashionable folk, drinking and attending to the paintings, which were mostly portraits. A knot of people stood in front of one particular canvas, a large portrait in a gilt frame displayed prominently in the center of the far wall.
“No,” I said. “Not Holmes.”
My heart broke right there. I could feel it crack and crumble within me. He knew. Had known all these years. Known and never breathed a single word, but pretended he knew nothing of my life, my past.
“Don’t be such a prig, Watson,” said Holmes. He was scanning the throng, looking for something – or someone. “This way.” He pulled me along with him. A tall, thin man was standing in the corner, smoking a thick cigar. “Pardon, but are you the proprietor of this establishment?”
I awoke in the morning, aching in every part, inside and out. And aching in my heart. What was my life to be from now on? Would the Irishman have his pleasure and then release me? Perhaps I could then forget it had ever happened. Perhaps my seminary would accept me back – I could repent of my sins and beg forgiveness. I could hide there, away from my shame. And not just the shame of being violated in a way no man can be and still be a man.
“If you entered that establishment, you would be shocked to see many of our finest men of letters cavorting there with common grooms, apprentices, and telegraph boys who supplement their incomes assuaging the perverse appetites of avowed sodomites.”
“So your father inherited the house, but not the title?”
“There you are, John,” he said. “I wondered where you had gotten to. You weren’t in your room or in the Recreation Area.”
“I’m sure she is,” I returned. “But I’m deuced uncomfortable with all this matchmaking by these confounded women!”
“Respect for society?” he scoffed. “What is society but a stew of hypocrisy?” The Irishman smiled at me. “Were the men you gambled with moral? Were the boys you caroused with respectful and full of good will? And what about yourself, Johnny Lad? Who are you to lecture me on the wages of sin? A young pup who is as green as the grass. A boy who believes that dressing in silk waistcoats and sleeping with dim-witted females is the be-all and end-all of life’s purpose. You should have stayed safe in your seminary. At least there you would have had a purpose and a belief, however wrongheaded it may be. Now what do you have? Nothing at all. You don’t even have a friend you could go to when you were in despair. Not even your own brother cares a groat whether you live or die. If those ruffians who threatened you yesterday had slit your throat, would a single person on this earth have truly mourned you? Tell me the truth.”
I fell in with a fast set of indolent young gentlemen. All we cared for was drinking, gambling, dressing like dandies, chasing women, and gaining entrance at the houses of our betters in order to sponge off them. I quickly became adept at all these practices. The skills I had learned on the continent served me equally well in London. I slept with a myriad of older but still extremely pleasing females, often while paying court to their daughters and playing cards with their husbands. But that was the way of the world, as Lady Percy would have said. I joined a club I could ill afford and there I gambled like a lord. I lost much, but when I won I took it as a sign that I was leading a charmed life. I ran up debts, but rarely paid them – I was young and paying my debts of honour could wait until I was older. Until I had a career and cash coming in. Or until my brother made good on them.
“You would know that as well as anyone, Doctor,” said Mrs. Jenkins. “Being his... his only real friend. I mean, that ever he’s had.”
“Holmes! What the devil?” I said, yawning.
“I know it was,” said Holmes. “An air-gun. And I know who shot it.”
“What’s the hurry?” I asked, still adjusting my cravat in the cab. “I should have let James do this.”
“No, Holmes,” I said. “You don’t understand...”
“So am I,” I offered. “The baby of the family.”
“Then, if you really do care for me, you will give me a chance to live. Not to spend the rest of my life running and fearful, a hunted thing. I want to walk freely again, while I still have the chance.”
But Holmes looked up at me and put his hand on my chest, tenderly. “John, this is not the same thing. Don’t think for a moment that it is the same. Never imagine that what we have done is anything like what my tutor forced on me that night. For I am not an innocent and haven’t been one for a very long time. But that night... I fought. I wept. And he laughed at my shame. The next day I could not leave my bed, I was in such pain. But I dared not tell anyone what had happened. I thought I was as guilty as the one who had... had...”
The carriage bounced along as the rain fell harder. And then the carriage slowed. The road was dirt and that dirt was turning to mud. And the mud mired the wheels, slowing us to a crawl. We were on a narrow lane edged by unkempt hedgerows, with ancient low-hanging trees pressing darkly and closely all around.
I felt a hand on my shoulder. “You take things too much to heart, my dear boy.”
“You?” the lad frowned. “Didn’t know it was yours, Doctor. The Guv’nor give it to me. Said I’d look a treat in it. ’Specially with me new weskit. Paid three shillings for it and worth every farthing.”
“No,” he said. “I think I shall remain here until I hear from Lestrade. But you go home and get some rest, my dear Watson. And don’t worry. I’m safer here than in Windsor Castle. Even if the Professor’s minions were to break into the Diogenes Club, they would never find their way to me through this maze of rooms. Or else they would be pitched out for the noise. The first rule of Diogenes, after all, is silence always.”
May became June and with June the summer sun beat down most pleasantly. Holmes and I took companionable walks in the garden and we even attempted a short ride in the carriage, although the bouncing made me wince.
Sherlock glared at him. Then abruptly he turned his attention on the cooks, who were listening intently to the conversation while trying to appear uninterested. "Are any of you
"I don't mean for you to change yourself."
John nodded, if dropping his head and pushing back into Sherlock's thrusts could be counted as nodding. Sherlock whined through his teeth, his fucking growing wild, and then all at once he thrust in hard and groaned, pulled back and plunged in again, and again. John shuddered, tensing all over, his own cock swelling in sympathy. Sherlock said, "Fuck," and John snorted a laugh at his earnestness.
"No. Not on purpose."
"I didn't expect you had," John said. He went to stand by the table and crossed his arms. "But unless I discovered you'd been laundering that money or running some kind of murder-for-hire racket on the side, I figured it wasn't my business."
In his jacket, his phone buzzed with an incoming text. John fished it out to look at it.
Sherlock smiled. He slid his phone back to safety and smoothed his hands down the front of his jacket. Into battle.
Watson had started to grin. “I’m sure you did,” he said, sitting down beside me. “And I imagine you had to read it, too, to make sure he hadn’t followed you back.” He took hold of the pillow and yanked it out of my hands, revealing my erection. He looked up at my face, eyebrows raised, and asked in a low voice, “How close were you?”
He fell back again, still shuddering, and Sherlock pulled away enough to swallow, then licked the last sluggish pulses from John's slit as they spilled out. John couldn't catch his breath. His legs trembled. He dragged Sherlock to his feet and kissed him, even before Sherlock had the chance to wipe his mouth again, and Sherlock groaned in desperation as John licked the taste of himself off Sherlock's tongue. Sherlock's cock felt huge where he rubbed it shamelessly against John's hip, and John worked his hand between them again to get it out.
The bathroom was full of steam and the water, when he turned it, on was still good and hot. Sherlock stripped and climbed in, slinging the curtain closed behind him. It smelled like John's shampoo. He stood for a few minutes under the water, letting it pummel the tension out of his shoulders and neck, before he set to his own quick wash. They had done it. They had opened a restaurant of his design in less than two months. They would do it again tomorrow, and the day after, and again and again until his reputation rewrote itself.
"Oh, nice," John said, spreading the notes out with a snap of the paper. "Did you just decide that? Right. Andy Dimmock you liked, Stanley Hopkins couldn't get enough of you, Emma Bradstreet can handle a knife, Toni Gregson has a brain, and Jonas Forbes didn't fuck up your caprese. There. Do you want to ring them or shall I?"
I hated this level of familiarity from men I'd only worked with once. Lestrade could get away with it because he was my friend and a regular visitor to the consulting rooms at Baker Street, but I had just met this constable.
Paul nodded shakily.
When John stepped into the room, he looked up in surprise.
"You are a very dear fellow," he said, "and it is why I love you. As a matter of fact, I was going to tell you that
"Don't mention it," Sherlock said, sticking a fork on the plate and handing it to John. "I don't know why I had it." He didn't look like he'd changed out of his shirt and trousers from the night before. They also weren't wrinkled, and John realised he might not have slept at all. However, he was barefoot, and for a moment John was distracted by the sight of his long, pale toes and the dusting of dark hair on the top of his feet.
"Go slow," John said, pushing up onto his right hand and gripping his cock tighter with the left. This worked.
good, a set of Italian wines that John didn't have a lot of experience with. One of them was £65 a bottle, which Sherlock lingered longingly over, giving John little hopeful glances. John sipped it slowly, regretting the last seventeen wines he'd tried for sullying this experience even a little. It was fruity and silky, and for a moment the noise in the room dulled a little as he met Sherlock's eyes again.
"So, what, you want to serve a chef's table all the time?
“No, I don’t,” he said, “and I’d rather not. I know he’s your assistant, but on how many occasions or in what capacity I don’t care. I also know he’s not a bad chap, and that you’re the right one to sort this out.”
"Yes, how did you know that, by the way? My injuries were kept out of the reports."
“No, really, I insist.” His grin was wolflike. He reached over and unfastened the top button on my trousers, brushing his hand deliberately along my prick.
The party was tolerable, but I always felt that way about gatherings this size. It would have been more interesting if Watson and I were not the center of attention, or if there were more strangers to observe in attendance, but it was all our acquaintances and friends and there were only a few new points of interest about anyone to pick up on. There wasn't even a crime scene to investigate. I stuck close to Watson as we were moved around the room and congratulated, and held a drink in my hand without drinking it. Occasionally Watson would find my elbow and give it a little squeeze. I suppose he thought I needed some reassurance, or perhaps it was he who needed it.
I nearly had a heart attack. "Bloody hell," I whispered. Watson's eyes were huge.
"Oh, don't be so fucking dramatic," Harry scoffed.
"John, this thing is fucked," Harry hissed at him, giving the blender one last vengeful jab into the avocado.
He'd brought the wine with him. We went across the road and sat on the wall that separated the road from the garden beyond. I swung my leg over to straddle it so I could face Watson. The cool air on my face cleared my head a little, but still I found myself admiring him quite openly. He offered me the bottle of wine, still smoking his cigarette.
"— I have misled you and entrapped you into some kind of—"
By the time he reached the downstairs hall, Sherlock was in the darkened sitting room, looking out the front windows. The line of his back was impassive and ramrod straight, until he moved and turned to look at John, and everything about him softened. He was silhouetted in the window by the street lights beyond, and John took a step into the sitting room without thinking.
"Gone."
"Fine," John said. The tea was just the way he liked it: dash of milk, no sugar. "When is that?"
Williams went off the path into the grass, and I followed. My eyes had adjusted to the dimness, a significant contrast to the gas-lit streets, and I was pacing him. He wasn’t a particularly dangerous fellow in nature, but I knew he was armed and so I needed to keep my approach strategic.
"What's going on?" he asked, closing the door behind him. Sherlock was sitting on the desk with his laptop on his knees and his feet on the chair, glaring at a spreadsheet of liquid nitrogen calculations. "You know him, don't you?"
"Fine," Sherlock said, and pulled hard, making all the snaps come undone at once. He pushed the coat off John's shoulders. "I didn't have a plan. It was pure sentiment. I didn't think you'd ever consent to cook for me."
"Oh, do shut up," Sherlock said. "If the excesses of this shower guarantee you run out earlier, so be it. I welcome it. You deserve better shampoo."
"Of course," the constable agreed. "Very sensible indeed. What was the error, may I ask?"
"Don't bin the recipe," John said, compromising on a matter he knew he was going to lose anyway.
"John," Idris Elba said, "you're not cooking to your full potential. This dish is a good example of that; you have a lot of knowledge, and a lot of inspired ideas, but you're not taking enough risks."
D'Arcy seemed to sense a certain coolness of my regard, for he stepped back and said, "Well, at any rate, gentlemen, I wanted to give you my thanks again on behalf of the village. I don't think we'd have brought you in if not for Lady Duncan–"
"It was our pleasure," I said.
John stared back. Sherlock's cheeks were red with a hectic flush, his eyes as wild as his hair. His lips were plump and wet, and he breathed heavily through his nose, nostrils flaring. John framed his face with both hands, curling his fingers behind Sherlock's ears, and pulled him in for another deep kiss. Sherlock moaned, deep and desperate, pushing John harder against the wall.
I held my breath, but he was as good as his word. He shaved them slowly, gently, until I could feel air on places that had not been exposed in a long time. I wondered if he were going to carry on until my entire body was as bare as a babe's.
He turns in surprise, his eyes filled with wonder.
"Yes, Chef," she said, gleeful, and went to check that the fryer was hot enough.
Sherlock snorted.
"Going somewhere?" it asks. The sound of its voice—his voice—tears a hole in the middle of my chest.
“A visitor? We were expecting no one.”
It was like at Maiwand. The noise and confusion. The pain and the blood, mine and that of so many others. Trying to stay awake. Stay alive.
“No!” she cried in dismay. “Don’t say that, Doctor! You can’t go and saddle me with Mr. Holmes! And that lad, and the dog and cat on my hands as well. I won’t allow it!”
I swallowed, unable to believe my luck. “Yes, I certainly would. I don’t care about the money. I only need to feel like a physician again.”
“Quick, Holmes! The box!”
“Poppycock!” said Holmes. “You may ring until your arm falls off, my dear fellow, no one will come. Lovell would sleep through a cyclone. And what if I needed you in the night? What if there were to be an emergency?”
“Kings and queens are mere figureheads these days, Johnny Lad,” he said dismissively. “The true power of the material world lies in the hands of men whose names will never be known, whose faces will never be seen. Such men do not seek notoriety. They eschew mere fame. They gain power and wealth by their very invisibility.”
“Obviously,” Holmes sniffed. “Now you’re one of them -- JOHN.” He emphasized my name like it was an obscenity.
“She’s after you,” James said bluntly. “Mr. Sherlock says so, too. She’s come to the door a number of times, but I was always able to put her off. I don’t know how she followed you to the park this time. She must have a nose like a bleeding bloodhound on the trail!”
“I see you did not bring a valet, Mr. Sherlock,” said Lovell. “Who will unpack and lay out your attire?”
I took the glass.
“I know,” he replied without irony. Then he turned to Collins. “When are Wiggins and Mitchell to be arraigned?”
“Not as confused as I am,” I confessed.
“Good Lord, Holmes!” I exclaimed. “You think I will let you run about the streets of London with that thing in your waistband? Is it loaded?”
“Good old Watson,” he said, sinking down into the deep cushions. “Tomorrow, then.”
“Ten days!” Mick moaned. “Isn’t there another way?”
“That seems rather arbitrary.”
“Can I come, too, Doctor?” James asked, meeting me on the stairs with the bag in his hand. “I’ll carry this for you!”
“Well, Johnny Lad,” he said. “You are in some trouble I see. But I think I might be of service to you – if you will be of service to me. Let’s have a little talk together, shall we?”
“I know.” I sighed and took out my watch. It was getting late and in the morning we were to get into Mycroft’s carriage and begin that long, wet journey back to London. But I did not wish to quit the library – at least not yet. This might be my only opportunity to visit Holmes’ boyhood home, my last chance to learn something of my reticent friend’s early life. “I’m sorry I did not visit the hives with you yesterday. You seem to put great stock in them.”
“I think I shall return to my room and omit dinner this evening.”
“Yes, sir,” the young man nodded. “Mrs. Jenkins says it’s been His Lordship’s room since he was boy, just as the room next door has always been Mr. Sherlock’s.”
“Laudanum?” Holmes made a disdainful face. “A nostrum for old women! Pour me a finger of whiskey and get on with your sewing, Watson. Perhaps a cross-stitch? With a lover’s knot?”
But what was still unsaid was hanging in the air between us like a poisonous smoke, and I had reason to fear that now it would never be dispelled.
“Mr. Holmes often stays out all night, especially when he is on a case,” I replied, picking up the morning ‘Times’ and unfolding it.
“Eventually,” he said. “We will get to the New World, my lad, by hook or by crook!” He laughed at his own meagre jest. “But we must off to France first. Paris in the spring is a wonder, is it not?”
“Leaving?” she said sharply. “Whatever do you mean, leaving?”
“I suppose it’ll be all right,” the warder said, looking cautiously at Holmes. He unlocked the iron door and let us in, locking it behind us. “Ten minutes and no more.”
“Yes,” I said, turning my eyes away from Holmes’ gaze. “I think I know the place. Quite gaudy, at least from the outside.”
“The bald chap – he has the winning hand. A straight flush,” he whispered in my ear.
“Of course not!” he retorted, opening his dark hazel eyes and gazing at me. “You know I eschew opiates in that crude form. This is an herb that is medicinal and utterly harmless. It has a tranquilizing effect not unlike kif. A former client sent it to me from Mexico, where it grows quite wild. Would you like to try some?” He offered me the mouthpiece.
“Holmes, I...”
“No,” I replied. “I don’t need to.” I dropped my blue dressing gown on the floor, revealing myself. There was nothing else to do.
“Mick is right as rain,” James said admiringly. “He’s just like his cat, Moggy – always lands on his feet, or so he brags.” James picked up the silver bowl and spoon from the tray. “If you would move over a trifle, Mr. Sherlock? The doctor needs to have this broth. Ma says to drink while it’s hot – that’s when the strength of it works best.”
“You were sent down?” said Holmes.
But in the quiet darkness that was for ourselves alone, we never addressed what might happen afterwards. Neither of us wished to sully what little time we had left.
I unfolded the missive with anxious hands and read, my worst fears confirmed: “Come immediately to Diogenes Club. S. wounded.”
The house was a large one, a detached dwelling set back from the road and apart from any of its neighbors. The carriage pulled up to the door and a silent servant ushered us inside. There was a chill over the place and a hush, as if warmth and speech were strangers there. I saw a sitting room where a small fire was lit and began to move towards it, but the Irishman’s iron hand gripped my shoulder like a vise.
“I am not rethinking anything. I am only concerned for the fates of those two poor souls.”
We were met by a raucous crowd, a mix of unkempt rogues, young City clerks, and expensively turned-out nobs. In this motley assembly we did not even warrant a second glance. But one thing was notable – there was not a single female to be seen in the place.
“But she didn’t do anything!” the boy cried. “It isn’t her fault! I swear.”
In the evenings we sat by the fire in the library, reading and discussing the ordinary events of the day. I once again began to make notes of some of Holmes’ cases with a view to possible publication sometime in the distant future, and Holmes enjoyed my interrogation of him about his past glories. But it was not as cozy as our sitting room in Baker Street and I began to long to be home.
“At your service, sir. Just call if you’re needing anything.” He bowed and left me alone in the dark and cavernous room.
“Yes, Mrs. Hudson. James is a footman at Mr. Mycroft’s house.”
I closed the door and sat on the bed. My hands were trembling as I tore it open and read the message.
His cheery smile faded. “’Cause it is grave, Doctor. Can’t do anything but make a joke of it. But the last laugh’ll be on me and Dilly. They got us dead to rights, Guv’nor. We was in the room with the stiff when the coppers come in and me with blood all over me hands.” The boy stretched out his fingers and inspected them. “Dead to rights. And dead for certain soon enough.” That’s when his composure crumbled utterly and he began to sob like a child.
“We have to get him into a carriage! Quickly! Where’s the nearest town?”
“Thank you for the compliment, but...”
But his words were cut off suddenly. I heard an odd noise, like a low whistle, and felt a blast of air, and then I was falling forward...
When I returned from the East, my health broken and my fortunes at a low ebb, I had expected to resume residing with my only living relative, as I had done throughout my medical studies. But upon arriving in London, I learned that my brother Henry, his law practice and business ventures in a shambles, had left for the West Indies in a frantic attempt to shore up his fortunes. Alas, he staked his future in Jamaican rum, but more rum went down his throat than was exported and that business failed as well. To my dismay, I found my brother’s house shut up and the contents, including my mother’s portrait, disbursed. I attempted to trace it, since it was the only family heirloom I cared anything for, but to no avail.
I closed my eyes and threw it forcefully into the fireplace, where it smashed into sharp white and blue fragments.
“They are beautiful,” whispered the Irishman. “And you are beautiful still, in them, John. Captured in your matchless beauty, forever in time. Forever.” And then he laughed.
“Luck!” he ejaculated. One of the players turned to glare at him, but he stared the man down. “Luck is for those who want to lose. I never rely on luck, but on my own mind. It never fails me.”
“He didn’t deserve your love or your respect,” he answered. “Don’t waste your grief on him.”
“Ah!” he cried with undisguised delight. “You have me at a loss, sir, since I do not know your name.”
Holmes. But it was impossible. I thought I saw him, but it was impossible. He was in London, in Mycroft’s rooms. That is where I had left him. He could not be here, on this muddy roadside. It was proof that I was dying – that my final wish would be granted with the sight of him, even if it was only a fantasia.
But tomorrow would be a different story.
“You and friend always together here. Rest in cubicle after massage.”
“You can decorate your room any way you wish,” said Holmes, showing me around. “If you don’t like this bed or the furniture, say the word and I’ll have it taken away.”
The door of the house opened and a tall, dour man emerged. He came down the walk and opened the gate, shouldering my trunk and picking up my valise. I took my bag and the box of books and followed him back up the walk and inside.
North London, 2009
“Society,” he replied. “And the way of the world.”
“Dr. Watson? Sir?”
Mrs. Hudson was waiting at the entrance of 221b when Holmes and I came in with the box full of cat.
“You seem to think I am a hired cab,” said the Irishman. “I remember dropping you off at another destination after we first met. Do you recall that evening?”
A strange knot clenched my stomach. “Is that... Young Wiggins coming?”
I could almost hear Mrs. Hudson counting to ten. But then she smiled sweetly and said, “I’ll bring up your tea directly, gentlemen.”
I walked back into the bedroom, clutching the pistol in my trembling hand.
“I watched you... with that boy,” he whispered hoarsely. “I... saw all.”
“We’re likely to ride to the coast in a farm wagon,” I observed.
“Doctor! I say!”
“We are fatigued by our journey, so if you’d be so good as to serve us dinner as soon as you are able we would be most grateful,” said Holmes, proceeding up the stone steps and into the entry hall as the rest of us followed in his wake. “We will also be wanting hot baths. My colleague, Dr. Watson, has a bad leg, so he will need plenty of hot water for a long soak each evening before he retires. He is also a late riser, so see that breakfast is available until 10 o’clock every morning. I will be up quite early, as is my usual habit. Coffee over tea. And I prefer a whole-grain loaf for my toast. It has more substance. Watson likes sausages with sage. And he prefers white bread, very lightly toasted. And cut on the diagonal only.”
That last night, after Final Affirmations, they had a small party for me in the Recreation Area. One of the nurses made a cake and there was Orange Squash and lemonade and it was rather jolly in a way. All the patients in my Group were there, minus Arthur, the Metallica fan, who had ‘graduated’ a few days before. But Betty, who was in long-term, was front and center, as well as Fred and the other counselors.
“And what was the brother’s name?”
“Yes,” said Holmes. “Dilly Mitchell. There isn’t much more time.”
“If they are innocent, then we must do all we can to free them,” I affirmed.
“Your leg only wants exercise,” said Holmes, dismissively. “There are some fine walks in West Sussex. Beautiful country, that. Historic.”
In my early years there I was so tender-hearted it’s a wonder I survived, but I did survive, and that regimen tempered me, like a steel blade is tempered. I was never the top pupil, but as the years ground on I felt the sting of punishment less and less. At thirteen I became aware that the Fathers had singled me out, for what I wasn’t sure. They gave me privileges, allowed me to go on special retreats reserved for the older boys, encouraged me to seek them out for guidance. And then I realized that they wanted me for one of their own. My father even mentioned it during a rare visit home. My brother had already gone into my father’s law office, so, my father said, he had thought to have me follow my maternal grandfather’s profession as a doctor, but the head of my school had spoken to him and so I was to enter the Jesuit seminary as soon as I was old enough.
“I slept...” I paused. The reason I had difficulty rising in the morning was that I often could not get to sleep, or else woke often in the night from unremembered but troubling dreams, as well he knew. “My sleeping habits are of no consequence, Holmes.”
I kept my eyes closed, not yet wishing to leave the warmth of the huge bed. No wonder King James found Sherringford Hall a pleasant place to stay – I mean, besides the presence of the First Earl. The bed was quite the most comfortable I had ever spent the night in. I could feel the chill of the room and had no wish to leave its cozy confines.
“That what?”
I would leave and never think of him again. That was my vow.
“If he is, in fact, her brother, and not another lover.” Holmes paused from his pacing to re-light his smoldering pipe. “And these letters you wrote – they were explicit?”
I rolled my eyes at him, then turned to my patient. “How are you today, young man?” I removed the bandage. The scoring was still red and angry-looking.
“I’m going to work for you two gentlemen,” James stated with assurance. “It’s not proper that two fine gentleman like yourselves should have no valet to do for them. I’m going to remedy that lack.”
“But you must have believed I was in league with him!” I insisted. “It was too much of a coincidence that I, of all men, should be presented to you as a lodging mate.”
“Dr. Watson, welcome to our home,” she said graciously. “So pleased to have you dine with us. I hope you will regale us with stories of your adventures with Mr. Sherlock Holmes. We have read of him often in the newspapers and of all his exciting doings.”
His lips came close. “Your lover. I had a desire to observe him. To see what had claimed you for so many years. I wished to see you two together. To understand your fascination.”
“And Mick? How does he fare?”
I went out of the library and started up the stairs, only to find young James dogging my steps. “Sir! I forgot to thank you.”
“I was going to bring your dog up with me,” James continued. “But the women are fussing over him down in the kitchen, feeding him scraps and making much of him. He’s eating it all up with a spoon, I must say.”
The difference was being fucked by some nameless chap in a characterless flat, with no feeling, no meaning, and no future, and making love with...
How can I express something that is beyond description?
“Such a pretty face,” said the larger man, a fellow with dead eyes and a slim stiletto that he pressed lightly against my ashen cheek. “Be a bloomin’ shame to see such beauty all bloodied and scarred, wouldn’t it, Fred?”
I closed my eyes and pictured Holmes. Imagined him there, in my arms, the way I had so often pictured him, when I was with a female or, more recently, with Mick or Thommie or even the attendant at the bathhouse.
But all was not well in London. There were pretenders to the Irishman’s empire, as well as Scotland Yard, which was breathing down the necks of many of his minions. But always the Irishman himself stayed aloof. He had made certain that it was difficult, if not impossible, to connect him to the many enterprises he surveyed. But he was restless, very restless, and that made him touchy. He sometimes lashed out at me in anger, but I could never strike back – to do so would have been too dangerous. I found that I liked my life, even if it lacked all purpose. Even if it lacked any sense of honour or decency.
"Fortunately for you, yes," she said, grinning. "I'm getting a two beers from Bulldog in right before we open. They've committed to it, and have promised me twelve kegs a week to start. Nothing in cans, though, I'm afraid. I don't think Sherlock's happy about it. The beer, I mean. This restaurant's not for 'regular blokes,' he'd say."
"I rest at home; I don't wear it it all night."
"Maybe," Sherlock said, returning the kisses and rubbing his nose against John. "I'm hideously self-important, or so the reviewers have told me."
"God, that's bloody gorgeous," John said, his thrusts rolling slow and steady, pleasure thudding up his spine. He drew back until he had almost left Sherlock's mouth, the length of his prick wet and gleaming with Sherlock's saliva, and then slid easily back into the pit of Sherlock's throat. He couldn't help starting to speed up, rocking faster and faster, until his cock was like a piston and the need to come was gathering deep in his gut. Again, Sherlock sensed his growing need; he was awfully well attuned to John's body. He pushed John back against the wall again, taking over with his hand, and began to jerk John off hard and fast. He pulled his mouth off altogether, wiping his wet face on John's pants at his hip, and stroked him while he caught his breath. John stroked his hair, hands roaming over his scalp and down his neck, rubbing his shoulders beneath his shirt, and it was only a matter of moments before Sherlock, apparently recovered, had fit his lips around John's cock head once again. He matched his hand and mouth, stroking John off while he sucked him, and wriggled his other hand into John's pants again to press John's tightening bollocks against the root of his prick.
I let go of his dressing down and slipped my hands beneath, instead, tugging his shirt out of the back of his trousers. The touch of my palms against his bare skin made him moan. I pulled him up for another deep kiss, and he began to unfasten the buttons on my shirt.
"Sorry," I said, letting go reluctantly.
“Sorry sir, no only looking allowed. You can buy it or you can move along.”
"I do not."
I blinked at him.
There was a general murmur of assent. Behind John, Sherlock was still and silent, formidable in his pristine uniform whites. John could feel the intensity of his attention without even looking at him. They had spent the wee hours of that morning putting together the mise en place, arranging all the food John had bought for their preliminary tests, and making the kitchen presentable and navigable for a parcel of new cooks. John was no longer used to working those sorts of hours. He'd gone soft.
I hesitated, understanding the importance of the question. Our man had been kicked by a horse at some point in his unsavoury youth, which resulted in an undeniably weak left leg.
Sherlock eased a third finger into him, but his patience was apparently reaching its limit for he only worked it in and out a few times before he was pulling out altogether. John heard him tear open a condom wrapper and shut the bedside table drawer, fumble for a moment, and then his right hand, the clean hand, settled on John's tailbone. The touch of his cock head against John's hole made John moan—he was so wet, so fucking eager, body clenching down on nothing and wanting quite the opposite.
“Holmes–”
Sherlock said, "I'm going to start them on the shellfish bisque, and they'll look busy in the background."
I looked over at him, prone on the bed with his head under the pillow, unconvinced. Holmes had hidden a lot of things over the years, but a yearning desire for me was unlikely.
John's laugh was forced. "He's the brains of the operation," he said. "I'm the brawn."
"That settles it," he said, shrugging into the jacket and replacing his hat upon his head. "Blakeley is dead, and we'll have to get the boats out to trawl for his body. Inspector, start your searches at the St Catherine's docks, but account for at least two days of tides, if not three. The last confirmed sighting of Blakeley alive was Thursday; they might have knocked him on the head the very same night. Watson, you and I have another mission."
Sherlock slipped his hands underneath to help. Together they freed John of the fabric, mussing his hair as they went. John's left shoulder had a little less range of motion than his right, so Sherlock was gentle. He tossed the shirt away off the bed and turned back to look.
"Of course you didn't," Sherlock said. He scraped a pile of vegetables into the pan with the eggs and folded the eggs neatly over onto themselves.
"John!" Sherlock thundered. "Get in here, now!"
“Quite,” Watson agreed. He offered me his elbow, and I took it. I indulged myself for a moment by squeezing his upper arm; despite his illness and the time he had spent back in England, his muscles were still pleasingly firm.
That stung. "Oi!” John said, and gave him a harder kick. "If you think I'm boring, you can get out of my flat."
Getting into the carriage with the Irishman was my first mistake. It would not be my last.
Soho has long had an unsavory reputation that is, in my humble opinion, well-deserved. Not only is it a den of vice and a refuge for disreputable foreigners, but an unhealthy aura hangs over its wretched streets, a remnant of the days of the infamous cholera epidemic of 1854. I well remember one of my professors at medical school relating to us the horrific scenes he had witnessed as a young doctor during that dark interlude.
“Holmes?” I said in surprise.
I shuddered at the word ‘grave.’ All I could think on was the Irishman telling me that Holmes was only alive because he did not wish to kill him – yet.
“Don’t think that way, Doctor,” she returned. “The truth is that when Mr. Holmes first wanted to lodge here, I turned him down flat. I asked for three references and he gave them to me, including the landlady of his previous set of rooms. They all told me to avoid him like the plague! They said that although he looked like a gentleman, he was loud, rude, dirty, and had habits that would drive the entire household to distraction. But when he brought you around and I saw what a fine and distinguished gentleman you were, I changed my mind. I decided that if a man like you could call Mr. Sherlock Holmes his friend, then I would take a chance on him as a lodger. But if you’re leaving – well! I don’t think I can take it! If you go, then he’ll have to go as well!”
If we hadn’t brought the dog, then we could have taken the train from Victoria Station and arrived in Chichester well before the morning was done.
“They took my key, along with my money and my comb, when I come in here,” Mick said, glaring at Collins.
“I imagine you are right,” I agreed. “Did the major offer any further information?”
I could not stop myself, but picked up his pillow and pressed it to my face. His scent, his essence filled my being.
“It’s the footman!” I said in alarm. “For the sake of heaven, Holmes! Get under the bed!”
“Not yet,” the Irishman insisted. “You have not seen the portraits in this annex. They are quite rare, by a painter not as well-known as Monsieur Vernet, but still very good. An Italian who specialized in works for gentlemen of a particular taste. These pieces are by invitation only. They were the ones I wished for your friend Mr. Holmes to see. I know he will find them intriguing.”
It was time to face my past and confront the Irishman – my former lover, Professor James Moriarty.
“Did Holmes or Mycroft ever show an affinity for drawing?” It seemed curious that neither of them had inherited the talent, with such a strong inclination on both sides.
The performers stood and bowed, Thommie gathering up his robe, while the fair-haired man awkwardly scrambled back into his breeches and shirt. The lad straightened the velvet covering and then stepped off the stage. A moment later two young females, one blonde and one redheaded, entered through the side door and began to undress one another.
“You don’t know... you can’t know the half of it, Holmes,” I blurted. “Or you would not be kissing me. You would not want to look at me, if only you knew all!”
“You are a spoiled brat,” said the Irishman. “Entranced by your own beauty and certain that you will always get your way. And, if you follow my instruction instead of that of the well-meaning but very limited Lady Percy, then you will certainly always get your way from any man and woman you desire. Except me, of course. Because I will always know what you really are.”
“I changed it myself,” said Holmes. “Quite neatly, I might add.”
Holmes stopped and looked at me strangely, his dark hazel eyes glittering. “You have no idea, my dear fellow. No idea whatsoever.”
“Bah!” Holmes said, hailing a cab. “We are in search of a box of a particular size.”
“Yet you offered me one,” I pointed out.
“A scandal?” said Holmes. “Were you involved in it?”
Would Holmes even believe me? Perhaps he would know I was lying but pretend to believe me. Then we would be able to part on equal terms, both knowing that the truth was too disturbing to support.
“Chimpanzee,” Holmes mumbled as he stirred.
Dilly Mitchell was undoubtedly doing much worse than poorly, if his condition was as bad as it had been the last time I saw him in his cell. “I must go to London immediately! Is there a physician seeing to the lad?”
The halls of these old lodging houses are unlit and their floors uneven, so we proceeded with due care. On the third floor Holmes pushed open the connecting door and I followed him through to the adjoining structure. He silently prowled the hallway, his head cocked, listening.
“Don’t lie to me, Micky,” Dilly uttered with difficulty. “I’ll never feel the sun again. But don’t cry. I’m not unhappy. This world’s too good for the likes of Dilly.”
“But that is Mr. Mycroft’s room!” exclaimed the butler, scandalized.
And the soup was brought out and set before us.
The other thing that never occurred to me to wonder about was whether I had a desire to be a priest or a vocation for such a life. That was never a question. It was assumed that I believed and that being selected was the proof. Now all I had to do was be worthy of the honour.
The other unfortunate mitigating factor was that I found him fascinating.
“I swear, John,” said Wilde – Oscar – as we sipped the sherry. “I have the strange sensation that I know you from somewhere, but I cannot recall where we might have met.”
“You heard the doctor,” said Holmes, herding the contingent to the door. “Allow him to examine the patient in peace.”
When I returned to Baker Street early the next morning I was not proud of myself. In fact, I felt mortification about what I had done – giving in to my baser instincts. But that seemed to be my fate – I meant well, but the result was always disaster. As I climbed the front steps at 221b, I could not help but wonder if going off with the Irishman would be another of these disasters. But it was too late to renege on my obligation, and in any event the Irishman would not permit me to nullify my promise.
“This pigeon is unlikely to fly very far,” I returned, leaning close to Holmes. “It’s as I feared. Galloping consumption, I would say. Dilly needs to be seen by a specialist to confirm the diagnosis. And she – he – needs treatment – immediately.”
“Well...” Holmes paused. “Yes... and no.”
“Yes, what a gift,” I said. But Wilde did not seem to catch the irony in my voice. “I fear I must go.” I stood and shook Wilde’s hand. “It was a pleasure to meet you – Oscar.”
“Men who prey on the weaknesses of their fellows are a sorry lot,” Holmes concurred. “Young Griffith is a mere lad, unused to the true evils of the world, and so he was ripe to be exploited. Unfortunately, Major Griffith is an obstinate ass and unlikely to give his son the kind of guidance he will need to avoid such contretemps in the future.”
The Irishman had settled my debts.
“Ah,” I said. I had noted a marked resemblance between the two young men – they were of an exact height and similar in coloring, which, I am told, is vital for a matched pair of footmen. It also seemed logical that in a country household many of the servants would be related, perhaps family retainers going back generations. “Your mother is a very fine cook indeed.”
I still wasn’t certain what it was these gentlemen, or the Prussian soldier for that matter, wanted to do to me. Put their pricks up my bumhole? That’s what Lady Percy said, and if that was sodomy, then I had to bow to her superior knowledge.
“Well, I am a damned conceited ass. That is part of my charm,” Holmes sniffed. “If the major does not engage my services, then I will undertake the investigation on behalf of Young Charles, forgoing my usual fee. The Griffiths are old family friends, after all. Now, go back to sleep. I’ll be deuced if I’m going to crawl through that freezing passageway at this hour of the night when this bed is so cozy and warm!”
“The idea of Mick Wiggins in a policeman’s uniform is a jarring one,” I said. “But he certainly does not lack for spirit or bravery.”
“Who, indeed?” Holmes sighed. “But that doesn’t explain why you began prostituting yourself as well.”
“I say, Holmes!” I protested, my cheeks warming in embarrassment at the thought of the ample Mycroft Holmes joining me under the bedclothes. “You go too far!”
“I say, my boy, would you hand me the hookah?”
Insufferable fellow!
“I did not know enough to talk back then,” I replied. “But I have had many years to form a few opinions of my own. I beg your pardon if they don’t square with yours.”
“You are surprised, no doubt, at the quality of the repast in such a backwater as Sherringford,” he said.
I felt his cold feet touch my calves. “Egads, man! Put them against the brick!”
“I mean,” said Stamford, pointedly. “That Sherlock Holmes is known to be a man who – how shall I put it? – is unlikely ever to marry. Ever.”
Chapter 7
“And I doubt you will see him until next Christmas,” said Holmes. “And if he arrives in the middle of the night and finds Watson in his bed, then he will have to deal with that as he will. He might actually welcome a warm body in his bed. It’s dashed cold in this place, even in April!”
“He’s a reader,” observed Holmes, indicating a stack of magazines on the bedside table. “‘The Police Gazette.’ ‘Blackwood’s.’ Even ‘The Strand.’” He picked up the topmost. “I believe this is the issue with your last story in it: ‘The Adventure of the Rajah’s Tomb.’”
I immediately unpacked and washed for dinner. I had many questions for my friend Holmes and hoped that he would be in a frame of mind to answer them.
“What you will see if you go to Naples with Freddy Brigham is the ceiling of a cheap hotel, because he will have you on your back the entire you are there – and he will then share you with all of his equally odious friends!” said Lady Percy. “I hate to be blunt, John, but you need to open your eyes! Did your father not warn you? Have you no elder brothers to guide you in avoiding such men?”
Holmes sighed. “I would be a very poor example of a detective if I had not undertaken to find out everything I could about a person with whom I would be living in such intimate quarters. How could I be certain that you were not an agent sent by my greatest enemy to spy on me, perhaps even to murder me?”
“I’m having a drink at the Criterion, sir,” he said without even a trace of shyness. “It’s just down the way. Care to join me?”
“In the woods – somewhere! He can’t have gotten far! Send your men out looking!”
“We must pack. We leave for London tomorrow on the train,” he informed me.
James made a grim face. “It was bad, Doctor, and that’s no lie. But we’ve been here every moment. Mr. Sherlock slept on the floor next to your bed – he refused the chair or the divan – in case you woke in the night and called for him. But you mainly mumbled nonsense about India and such. Lord, Doctor, you seem much better now!”
“Oh?” Thommie’s interest was piqued. “Been together a long time, have you?”
“Suit yourself,” she shrugged. “But you’ll come around. You should cheer up, young gentleman. I never saw the master take so to anyone. He’s quite besotted, he is. You could have anything you desired. He’s wealthier that you can imagine, although he don’t put on airs.”
“James!” I ejaculated. “I’m shocked by your vulgar vocabulary! You’ve been spending far too much time in the company of Mr. Wiggins and have picked up his impudent patterns of speech. That is not a very gentlemanly description of a respectable and lovely lady.”
How could I explain that I was going away with the man who had so damaged him in order to save his life?
“There is a music hall in Holborn,” said Charles. “The Red Cockerel. Well, it is not exactly a music hall, it is more like a public house with a stage in the back room. But that’s where I met her.”
“Capital!” said Holmes, going into his own room. “I will see you downstairs to dine, Watson.”
Constable Clark came into the room and seized Dilly Mitchell by the arm, but the frail boy crumpled in a dead faint.
“Here,” said Holmes, handing me the invitation card. “Why not go to the gallery? It might prove amusing and they are certain to offer free food and drink. I will meet you there after I finish my business and then we’ll have supper at the Café Royal or the dining room at the Langham. How does that sound?”
And all that while I had loved him. Desired him. Hid my hideous yearnings under the veil of friendship. And this was the ignoble result.
“But how do you know, Holmes?” I asked. The buildings in these dark streets had no numbers to distinguish them.
I filled my small trunk and valise with clothes and a few mementos, but carried the box with my papers into Holmes’ room. They were his cases, I had merely set down the particulars. Now they were truly his. I vowed never again to put pen to paper. Mr. Wilde would have to take up the slack in tales of suspense and adventure, for John H. Watson would be seen no more in the pages of ‘The Strand.’
“Yes, I understand. We will sort it all out and find him a position in a suitable household. Mr. Mycroft might know of one. After all, James was working in his house.”
“So foolish!” I muttered.
“Wait!” I whispered. “The door is open and a nurse might walk in at any moment.”
“Very well.” I set the teacup on the tray and lay back down. Holmes nestled deeply into the bed, grunting in a way that reminded me of Gladstone. I closed my eyes, praying that the dream would not return.
“Mr. Sherlock will get no dessert until he finishes his greens.” I sat back smugly. It felt good to command.
And I was in the middle of it all. I was the Irishman’s companion. His boy. His catamite. But that made little difference in the circles in which we traveled. They were used to sex and sin and drink and anything else that blocked out reality. Everyone had too much money, too many possessions, and all the time in the world to enjoy themselves. And I threw myself into that way of thinking, acting as if it would never end. Acting as if I did not care.
“Do you still believe in God?” he asked. “What a proper little Jesuit you would have made, Johnny Lad. But that would have been such a waste. You are much more suited to your new occupation. You have a composed exterior, but beneath that I perceive a restless and passionate nature. At least the females you have found pleasure with have been complimentary of your skills as a lover.”
“You had better catch him before he jumps into the water,” I advised. “If we bring him home wet and muddy, Mrs. Hudson will have all three of our heads!”
“Innocence is a relative term,” the Irishman reflected. “In the eyes of most decent people, those two are hardly innocent and deserve whatever penalty they draw.”
Mick looked up at me and grinned wickedly, which flustered me greatly. I turned my head and saw that Holmes was also staring at me with a gimlet eye.
The frightened beast hissed piteously as I reached into the depths and threw the towel over her. That’s when the cat really began to yowl and flail.
But I knew he wasn’t sleeping. For one, he wasn’t snoring. Although I’d told him he snored like a buzzsaw, he refused to believe it. “I would certainly know if I snored, my dear boy,” he sniffed. “And I don’t. So let that be the end of it.”
He ignored Fred as a lion might ignore a gnat. “Holmes. Please call me Holmes. And I’ll call you Watson, if you don’t mind.”
“I think you should go up to bed,” he said, cutting me off. “We will make an early start tomorrow and there is much work to do in London if the Griffith case is to proceed. We could tarry here another day or even a week, but what help will that be to Young Charles?”
It made me happy to contemplate my success at working the program, but at the same time I was thrown into despair at the knowledge of what I’d be leaving behind.
“He might be gone for a number of days,” I informed her. “I’m sure he will send you word if it is to be longer.”
“Robbie reads everything and knows all the writers in the city,” Wilde explained. “Many of them are here tonight, along with some of our most illustrious artists and actors. And some that are not so illustrious, of course – all incognito, naturally. But I make no distinction whatsoever. I welcome the attentions of anyone who acknowledges my genius.”
“Yes, sir,” he replied. “I didn’t want to wake you ’cause you were so peaceful, but I didn’t want you to miss your meal.”
The Irishman grabbed me by the throat like a dog holds a rabbit. “I said do not question me! Go now and do as I say.”
“If you wish.” His long fingers caressed and threatened at the same time. “But I would be a fool to come here armed.”
“Oh, Dr. Watson!” cried Mrs. Hudson, meeting me at the door. “I was praying you’d return home soon!”
The man drove a wide German car and had a posh flat in South Kensington, all mods con, as they say. He seemed well-fixed, but I couldn’t say what it was he did. The place was decorated in that clean, generic way that says nothing whatsoever about the person who inhabits it.
“No,” he said. “I have had enough of that. I want my head to be clear so I can recall every sensation. The pain is not so great – not enough to hinder me.”
I stared at the man. “You have the gall to leave me hanging with so many mysteries unexplained? For instance, the title. Mycroft is your older brother. Is he the Earl of Sherringford or is there some other relative that might spring out of a secret door and leap into my bed?”
My heart began to beat too fast. I wasn’t certain that the meaning behind the words Holmes was speaking was the same meaning that had been inside me for so long. No, they could not be!
The boy turned his huge dark eyes on me. “Who would listen, sir? And who will bother to find the truth? I’ve seen boys swing who was dead innocent. But who has the price of a mouthpiece? The judge sits in his grand chair and pronounces and who’s to say he’s wrong? It’s just one boy less on the street and one body more for Potter’s Field.”
“Oh?” I said, interested that might be a distant connection. “I saw my action in Afghanistan as a doctor attached to the Berkshires.”
“Certainly, Mr. Carson,” Holmes replied.
But those stories did not depict the substance of my life. Those stories did not delineate the essence of my soul.
“Yes, I suppose I will,” said Sherlock Holmes.
Holmes paused to light his pipe. “Can any man – or woman, for that matter – live as freely as he might wish? Only the thoroughly lawless believe themselves free, but that too is a chimera, as Moriarty undoubtedly understands now, wherever he may be hiding.”
I had been visiting Regent Street to pick up a pocket-watch that I had left at Carson’s to be repaired – the winding stem had become loose. After retrieving the timepiece, I thought I might while away an hour at the Criterion Bar; perhaps I would meet Stamford there – it is his favorite place of refreshment – and have the opportunity to apologize in person for bowing out of his dinner party of the previous week. I am not in the habit of accepting dinner engagements and then reneging upon them. That would be the height of poor manners and incivility. Unfortunately, my intimate friend, Mr. Sherlock Holmes, with whom I share a suite of rooms in Baker Street, was quite ill that evening.
Holmes was where I had left him, motionless on the sofa. The girl had removed the tea tray, but the rooms were otherwise unchanged. Mrs. Hudson’s housekeeping skills were wasted in our suite – Holmes did not allow her dustcloths and brooms to cross the doorstep.
“Listen, my good fellow, I don’t know who you are, but...”
I thought about Mrs. Jenkins’s words as I undressed and prepared for my bath. That no one had ever cared enough for Holmes, as a boy or as a man. Until I came along. But what was my responsibility to my friend? And did he understand how that caring sometimes skirted what was decent and honourable – at least in my own conflicted mind?
“Amusement? You mean we are going to the opera?”
“Thank you, James. I imagine I’d need a map to find my way back from here.”
“That you are,” I agreed, raising an eyebrow. “And an expert in all the arts and essentials of love.”
And I knew I was looking at the end of my life.
“Love?” I asked.
“Splendid!” Holmes gave the young man a dig. “James, if you would carry the tray down for Mrs. Hudson?”
“We’ll own the whole place in a year!” Mick boasted. “Then you can come over and have a visit.”
Holmes truly is the most insufferable creature! His methods are as transparent as his motives are mystifying.
“I’m sorry, James, but I can’t help you.” I handed him the wet towel and put on my nightshirt and dressing gown. Then I used the chamber pot while he tidied up around the tub.
His quarters were Spartan. A bed, unmade. A table, piled with papers, books, and pipe paraphernalia. The press, gaped open, spilling a tumble of clothes onto the floor. Perhaps we did need James to keep order here, since Holmes would never allow Mrs. Hudson to breach his defenses.
“Thank you kindly, sir. When you told me you were leaving Baker Street, Doctor Watson,” James continued. “I must confess that I sent word to Mr. Sherlock as quick as I could. But he already knew what was what.”
“Is there an illness in your family?” Anstruther asked, softening a bit.
The flat (B) at 221 Baker Street.
“Excuse me.” I brushed past the insolent pair to get to the main salon.
Holmes was where I had left him earlier that day, lying on the sofa, staring upward.
I felt his body tighten.
“Just be quiet!” I turned over, my back to him.
“Her?” said Holmes in surprise.
“No, my dear, a coal mine might improve it,” replied his friend, a slender youth in a lavender waistcoat. “They let anyone in here, it seems.”
“Really, Holmes,” I protested. “This place is... is... objectionable.”
“Yes,” I admitted, not wishing to explain in further detail. “Sometimes.”
“Sausages,” she said. “And toast. Will you be wanting any more, Doctor?”
“Ah! That is soothing,” he said, shutting his eyes. “I should sleep well, regardless of my injury.”
“Yes,” I said. “I hear you. And I understand.”
“You can invest it for me, then.”
“No,” I thought of the oppressive atmosphere of the place. “I do not.”
“Well, they’re wrong!” James pronounced.
“This is a new experience for us,” Holmes interjected. Then he looked at me sideways. “For me.”
“Raped you,” I said. “For that is what it was. And for that your... tutor should be damned to the lowest circles of Hell. You should have told so he could be punished.”
“You can see that I am quite well,” I reassured her. I puffed out my chest to prove my point. “And all in one piece.”
“They were released over a week ago, once Lestrade finally believed that they had been framed for the murder of Fisher,” Holmes informed me. “Unfortunately, Dilly is... not well.”
The Earl, Holmes’ grandfather, looked a right reprobate. He was dressed somberly, but had the flushed face of a heavy drinker and the red-rimmed, leering eyes of a practiced sinner.
“So you and Mr. Wiggins are on a first name basis?” I teased. “What would your mother say to you befriending the likes of Mick Wiggins?”
“I’m here to see the Professor,” I pronounced.
“Your passion is evident,” I said. “I’m surprised you did not pursue biology or another study that related to the natural sciences.”
“He is incarcerated, yes,” Holmes confirmed. “He and his friend, Mr. Mitchell. But we hope they will soon be released.”
I saw a shadow in the doorway and a sonorous voice called out: “Bring him in.” And then the shadow receded.
“Who?” Holmes thundered. “Who are you so afraid of, Wiggins?”
“Something like that,” I replied, praying he would not press me further.
“You’re a rare card, sir!” Thommie laughed. “Not here! I know a place we can go. Nice rooms suitable for gentlemen. And they offer champagne for an extra charge.”
“And what do you know about my brother?” inquired Holmes.
“Yes,” said the Irishman. “Or harm him.”
“Always the jokester, Mr. Holmes,” Collins chortled. “You know I would never take a bribe.”
I undressed him one item at a time. His soiled shirt I slipped off and discarded. Then I checked the dressing, making certain the bandage was secure and the wound had not reopened. But I’m a physician and know how to work around... difficulties.
In the entryway I fumbled with my key, but the Irishman seized me with an iron hand and shoved me against the rough plaster wall. I thought he was going to kiss me and I held my breath, expectantly.
Two days later Dilly Mitchell was buried in a small plot in a cemetery north of the city. Holmes paid for it all, including a fee for a priest to come and say some words over the coffin. The only mourners were Holmes and myself, James and Mick, and Inspector Lestrade, who fidgeted nervously through the short service, while Mick wept and James held him.
I stood there in an almost paralytic condition while the rascal performed upon me an act which I can scarcely bring myself to recall. But I did not stop him. And after a while I did not recoil. After a longer while I did other such things that it shames me to name, so I will not, except to say that Wiggins was a master of his profession.
“Then what?”
“Yes,” I agreed. “Gladstone has his singular attractions.” The beast’s long tongue lolled out of his mouth and he began licking his balls vigorously.
“John! Don’t run from me!” he shouted. “That has ever been my fear – that you would flee from me. That my emotions, once stripped bare, would be loathsome to you. That I would be loathsome to you.”
“Capital,” Holmes uttered with a distinct lack of enthusiasm. “Murderers, plural, did you say?”
The interior of the Salisbury was ornate in a garish way, all mirrors and gold and mahogany fittings. I could see how a lad like Wiggins might be impressed with such a show, although it was not a place in which my simpler sensibilities would ever be comfortable. But the place was quite sociable. I recognized an actor I had seen play Laertes two season ago at the Royal, as well as a tenor with the D’Oyly Carte Company.
“Yes,” said Holmes. “An excellent guess. Completely wrong, but still an excellent guess. He’s an engineer, but he does have the haircut of a suburban solicitor. However, if you observe his shirt you will note that...”
“That is why I investigated you so thoroughly,” Holmes returned. “Your family background, your brother and his business dealings, your schooling and your youthful trampings around the Continent – I looked into every aspect of your life and could find no evil in you. And then your ensnarement in Moriarty’s web. You know he intended for you to gamble and lose, do you not? Because he wanted you, and so he arranged for you to fall so that he might save you, in his corrupt and cynical way. It was neatly and carefully done.”
Wiggins sauntered into the pub as if he owned the place and was greeted by another lad in an apron, carrying a tray. “’Allo, Mick!” the boy cried.
“I will double that,” I said, also pouring myself a large glass. “Did you sleep at all last night? Because you look like you’ve been dragged through the streets by a team of horses and then left in a garbage tip. And smell like it, too.”
John finds his way to a previous haunt.
“Does he have a name, this man?” I inquired, more gently. It was obvious that Mick was terrified of the consequences of crossing this sinister blackguard.
“I would never wish to cause you distress, my boy,” he replied. “The Langham dining room is a welcoming presence. You will feel better once you have had a meal. This has been too long a day.”
We waited through the long morning and then the afternoon as Dilly sank into a listless sleep. Even Mick grew weary and he came out of the niche to relieve himself and breathe some fresh air. But I noted that his face lit up as he pulled James aside and they spoke closely together.
“Don’t be stupid,” said Lady Percy. “Sit down and drink your coffee. You won’t leave until you are ready to leave. Don’t let those perverts scare you off. Remember that the world is full of evil and you must learn to recognize it for what it is. Only then can you decide if you wish to embrace it or leave it alone. Otherwise you should turn tail and run back to your seminary where you will be safe – although from what I know of some priests, you won’t be all that safe!”
“Because I know you, John,” he interrupted. “You cannot feign an attachment. It’s not within your character. You must have felt something for him to be with him, to stay with him, for so long. Remember that I know his power and his attraction. If he were not so twisted with evil Professor James Moriarty would be one of the greatest men in the Empire. Such men are not easily dismissed. There is good reason why he inspires intense loyalty, even if it’s among thieves and murderers.”
“You’ve mentioned this house before,” I gulped, closing my eyes and crossing myself. “Could you slow down a tad?”
How much was this my fault? There was my connection with Holmes and my connection with the Irishman – I was the sole link between them. The only tie. The Irishman had sent Holmes the drawings of me, which he had never mentioned. The Irishman had set himself up as Holmes’ nemesis and rival. He told me he had been watching me – watching us – for years. Watching – but to what sinister purpose?
“You did not stumble,” Holmes stated. “That was a gunshot.”
I nodded. “Feeding prisoners a sufficient diet is not a high priority at institutions of incarceration.”
“Steady on, Watson,” he whispered. “Steady on.”
He took me. And took me again. Took me until I was begging for more. Took me on the bed and on the divan and on the floor, until we were both spent.
“Yes, that’s a good man,” I returned. “Thank you.” Then I waited for him to leave me to my ablutions.
“I’ve been meaning to write you, old chap,” I apologized. “But Holmes and I went away for a few days, to Sussex, and then I had patients, and...”
“Never fear, my dear friend,” said Holmes said. “For you are the bravest man I have ever known.”
Holmes recoiled violently at Mick Wiggins’ words. “The Professor? This is what I most feared. Curse the bastard!”
“Simple observation, my dear fellow,” said Holmes. “I am, after all, now quite an expert in matters of the heart.”
“I believe Mick Wiggins’ lodging is not far,” Holmes commented. “Somewhere between here and Covent Garden.”
James shook his head. “No, indeed. But by the time you got here, you were delirious. Mr. Sherlock sent for a doctor from London. I came down to help out. There was an infection and the doctor feared for your life. But me and Mr. Sherlock never gave up hope.”
I do not know if Charles Griffith and his dilemma was on my mind, or if it was the proximity of Holmes in my bed, or some other confluence of memories and tangibilities that brought on the dream, but it came. We have no control over our thoughts in sleep and I had no control over this. But I do know that it was as real to me as when it happened so many years ago when I was only 18.
“No,” Holmes replied. “I would only stoop to such illicit measures if all else had failed and their lives were truly in danger. We must endeavour to free them lawfully and clear their names. That is the way Justice prevails.” He paused and pulled out his pipe. “Although if I wanted to break them out, I could do it in a heartbeat.”
“Your notes? I do not remember any notes from you, Miss Morstan. I certainly would have recalled any missive penned by so lovely a hand.”
Intimate! He and that insufferable trollop! I can barely think on it without screaming!
“Wait until we take to the open road, Watson,” said Holmes as he breezed through another red light. “We can motor down to Sussex and spend a weekend at the house. Mycroft is never there, so we won’t be bothered.”
I went back to the establishment again and again in a futile attempt to find the winning streak that would make all good. But that fortunate hand never came. One afternoon a pair of men, dressed in black with their hats pulled low over their faces, visited me at my brother’s house while he was at his office and warned me that if I did not pay up, I would live to regret it.
“You’re early,” he remarked. His face was grim. “I was afraid I would have to send someone to collect you.”
Holmes and Watson take a walk and have a talk.
This was real. This was material.
“But what about your mother?” I asked. “And your brother?”
I thought of Mick, languishing in the gaol cell. And Thommie, too, with his pale body and dark eyes. So many boys, so many men.
“Ain’t this place a treat?” said Wiggins, sipping his pint. “I know most of the nobs here and say ‘Howdya do?’ to them just like that!” He snapped his fingers.
I shut my eyes. It was not Thommie’s face I was seeing. Not Thommie’s arse I was ravaging. Not Thommie into whom I was spending.
“Fancy what just came in,” drawled one languid fellow, a green scarf carelessly flung about his neck. “That suit looks like it was made for a holiday in Cardiff!”
At fifteen minutes after ten the panel in the wall slid open and Holmes crawled through.
“And it certainly worked,” I said bitterly. “Corrupt and cynical is certain. And now all is tainted! All we might have had! Ruined!”
Lovell, standing at the ready, pulled out my chair without a word and I sat.
“There is no case,” I pointed out. “Major Griffith is unlikely to hire you to find his son’s blackmailer, especially since you quarreled with him and he undoubtedly thinks you are a damned conceited ass.”
I made my way along Pall Mall. The fog was heavy and full of the promise of spring rain. I hailed a cab which took me to Baker Street.
That turned my thoughts to my engagement for dinner.
“Blast the situation!” Major Griffith’s face was red with anger. “This is none of your affair! I will handle my own son in the way I see fit!”
“M’s rooms.”
“Bedside manner!” Holmes exclaimed. “No one has ever complained about my bedside manner before!”
“I can’t leave James to do all the work around here, can I, my dear boy?” Holmes sniffed after his most recent return. “Here is a cake from Mrs. Hudson. Don’t let Cook see you eating it. Mrs. Hopkins thinks she is the only one permitted to feed you, but Mrs. Hudson begs to differ and is certain you are being starved to death in some rustic hovel.”
“Anything more I can do for you, sir?” he asked. “Turn down your bed?”
That call was to me like a trumpet to an old warhorse. I leapt from my bed. “I must get my bag!”
“I observe,” said Holmes, lifting a cunning eyebrow. “You charmed even that old dragon Mrs. Jenkins, and that is not a mean feat. She told me she wishes we would visit more often. You never did get to view the Folly, did you? Perhaps next time. The views are deucedly romantic, if one believes in such twaddle.”
“I know.” There was sadness in his voice. “But it is you I have been thinking on.”
The servant shifted uneasily, but he unlocked the gate and let me in. I followed him up the path to the front door and entered without hesitation.
“But it does matter!” I cried – and a keen pain surged through me. I sank back on the pillows, feeling weak and faint.
He sighed. “I will see what I can do. But it’s bad business to turn good servants over to Scotland Yard, especially when they have simply followed orders.”
Dilly Mitchell opened his large eyes. They were a startling shade of cornflower blue, just as Charles Griffith had said. “Have you come to take me to the hangman, sir? I’m so afraid!”
“Do you want anything for the pain?” I asked. “Perhaps some of that herb you were smoking?”
“No!” I lashed out weakly. “Don’t touch me. Don’t...” But exhaustion prevented me from further protestations.
Then John's hand was gone from Sherlock's arse, and it closed gently over Sherlock's hand on John's chest. John flattened Sherlock's palm to his body and disengaged gently from their kiss. Sherlock looked down into his eyes, trying to keep his breathing even.
"Yes," Sherlock said. His voice sounded strange; distant. "I'll be here. Obviously."
“Or,” said I, lowering my voice, “since I see that you are busy, I could just pay it now.”
In the very earliest days of our courtship, Watson and I circled one another like two boats in a whirlpool: our fate was inevitable but we fought it very hard. I remember long evenings spent silently in his presence, unable to go any nearer to him but refusing to put any distance between us. When it became clear that we both suspected the other of an inverted nature and a fondness that bordered on attraction, still we hesitated. It was illegal, then, and the idea of risking our friendship to slake our mutual lust was terrifying. When finally we managed to speak honestly about it, it still took us hours to share our first kiss. We spent that night in his bed, fully clothed, savoring the simple contact of our bodies.
"Last night was a mistake," Sherlock said.
have a choice," John said. He crossed his arms to ward off Sherlock's look of indignation. "Sherlock, I've been telling you from the start, a single menu will bring people in once for the novelty, but will not sustain a business. Your pre-fab dinners are going to be amazing, and I cannot wait for people to try them. You are a genius at food." Sherlock blushed and looked away. "But you asked me to come on to turn that genius into a profit, and we are going to need an à la carte menu as well. I've been working on it."
"I'm not much of a catch," John said. He curled his fingers in Sherlock's hair once more.
"You always know where
"Thank God we didn't have to."
He led me into his bedroom, which was clean
John peered at the list around Sherlock's arm. "I'm sure they'll be fine, Sherlock," he said. "They've chosen to come, haven't they?"
"Chef Watson," Mycroft said. "I presume my brother— Ah, indeed, he is here."
Sherlock grinned. "No, she'll be fine. I'll make her cry twice, possibly three times, but not more than that."
"Chips," Sherlock repeated, aghast.
of criticism, the accusation that he was callous or unfeeling or insane, but then at least the slurs were more general and not directly related to his cooking. He also only did it to superiors or equals, never to anyone beneath him. In the videos John had seen, Sherlock would berate the commis chefs working at his station, but it was only ever about the food. Waiters, too, never got a dressing down, only a sharp word if they made an obvious mistake. The head chef, however, or the back of house manager, or the occasional entitled customer, took both barrels in the face.
that you were on, you know."
"Yes indeed," I agreed, my arms around his shoulders. He smelled of wine and smoke and the faint impression of his soap, applied so many hours ago. We'd worked hard these past few days, and the stubble of his facial hair scratched at my neck. I felt the sensation all over my body.
"Sherlock—"
The street was empty. Either he'd gotten into a cab or ducked into a doorway to avoid being seen.
Downstairs, Holmes had picked up his violin and was playing soft warm-up scales. As I listened and drifted, he began playing a Bach Air that I recognized. It was one of my favorites. If this was a change due to our matrimony, that he would refrain from his strange experimental non-music, I was not disappointed.
John trailed after him, sipping on command. Sherlock held the wines in his mouth for a long time, long enough that John's jaw started to ache watching him, and then dutifully spit them out in the receptacles. John swallowed. They picked six white wines out of the ten on offer, arguing over sweet and dry, and making the staff serving them visibly nervous. By the time they'd reached the first of the reds it was after seven, the great hall had filled up with other tasters, Greg and Molly had caught up again, and John was definitely on his way to tipsy.
“Ah,” the sommelier said, “John Watson, such a pleasure to meet you!” She had an English accent, and her hand was warm when John shook it. “I saw you on the telly last year.”
John."
"Portland Street or UCL?" the man asked, checking the temperature of the goo in front of him.
. Harry's host mum had been a hell of a cook, and Harry had used her rag-tag chef training to bring some of her authentic recipes to their peak potential–for British palates, at least.
“No, Mr. Sherlock, but...”
True, I fancy myself an author and have accepted payment for fictional works that purport to stimulate the senses of readers with scenes of mystery and intrigue.
Holmes’ hazel eyes were on me, unblinking. “I think you do, Doctor. You have faced down evil. And so have I.” He tossed his head, as if shaking that evil off his shoulder. “But no matter. I will take your case, Charles. You are now my client and I will not rest until you have justice.”
Holmes’ face changed. I can’t explain what I read there. Dismay? Anger? Disgust? I could not tell precisely, but it was something unsettling.
Stamford’s house was a tidy domicile on Christchurch Street, not far from the old Royal Hospital. Chelsea is a pretty area, remote from the city proper, yet accessible – perfect for a young doctor and newlywed making a name for himself. Stamford was a few years my junior, yet he was settled and well on his way to a successful career, while I... well, I did not want to contemplate my own bleak future.
If only I has been able to do the same.
“Simply making conversation,” I answered. “Unless you wish for me to remain completely silent for the rest of my natural life?”
“A cat!” she cried.
Why was I drawn to this infernal place? Perhaps it was my nature to seek out others of my own ilk, others who must, in their waking life, hide what they truly were.
“You might as well have let that monkey do it!” I snapped.
Holmes laughed. “Oh, he wanted to. I had to hide it and play in the barn or in the house only when the old man was away. Luckily that was often. I was quite downhearted for a time. And then a new tutor came to Sherringford Hall. A Mathematics fellow at Trinity. He was a friend of Mycroft’s and was in need of money, so he agreed to teach me the higher fundamentals.”
“Isn’t Mr. Holmes back yet?” she asked, setting down the tray.
“You need not worry, my dear,” I said. “Mick will surely find his way.”
"Then I propose we don't look too carefully," I said, wrapping him tightly in my arms. "And perhaps try to replicate it some time."
competition last year, is a well-liked if unimaginative sort of cook, who gained his fame through reliable recipes and his classically British stiff upper lip, as well as the presence of his loose-cannon sister and former business partner, Harry Watson. Holmes, on the other hand, is famous on YouTube for his vicious if amusing verbal assaults on fellow cooks, and his website is filled with assertions that molecular gastronomy, a fad the food business gave up on five years ago, is the way of the future. What brings them together, then? Holmes can't keep a job, and Watson's burned to the ground.
He huddled into his coat, wishing he'd brought a scarf. The back of his neck tingled. Sherlock's dark blue scarf was a soft and luxurious merino. John coveted it. He could just imagine the warmth and prickle of the wool against his skin, and the lingering scent of hair product and Sherlock's skin.
and you are…”
Sherlock lifted his head to look into John's face. "As a business partner or as a lover?"
"Dr John H. Holmes," I chortled.
John reached for the shampoo on the rack behind him and squeezed a little too much into his hands. As soon as Sherlock lifted his head John turned them around, positioning himself under the spray. He dug both hands into Sherlock's hair, lathering. Sherlock's knees wobbled and he slapped a hand against the tile wall to steady himself. The purr that rumbled out of his chest made John swear to try and repeat this experience more often. As the water sluiced down his back, washing away the layer of sweat from the kitchen, he washed Sherlock's hair with a gentle sort of vigour, keeping the soap out of Sherlock's eyes, but being sure to give his hair a few firm tugs to keep him pliant. Sherlock's cock stood up proudly out of the thick, black curls of hair at his groin. Its rosy head was peeking out of its foreskin, gleaming.
Ah, that put a few things in place. Sherlock had been very free with the cheques he wrote, assuring John he had nothing to worry about and to please, in fact, stop bothering him, but he’d been cagey about the source. John had never suspected it was coming from somewhere illegal or inappropriate, and he had begun to think Sherlock hadn’t even heard the word ‘credit’ before in his life, but now Sherlock’s reticence fit the pattern.
"Got bored," John said. "Is this for the
"Did I wake you?" Sherlock turned to see his answer.
John stooped to pick up the paint roller again. "Bloody magnificent," he said. "I'm calling Clara."
Sherlock stared down at him. John stared back, his smile fading into serious contemplation. Then Sherlock said, "That one's true."
"I'm not risking our food hygiene rating to get off with you here when there's a dozen perfectly good, food-irrelevant surfaces upstairs."
His collar still sat on the dressing table, and his top two shirt buttons were undone, so I pushed my hand down the back of it and squeezed the muscle in his shoulder. He kissed me deeper, his tongue pressing between my lips, and I could taste the soap at the corners of his mouth. It was sharp and bitter; I pulled him closer.
Young women do not threaten me. Watson, though he still has eyes for the occasional fair-haired beauty, shows no lasting interest in women. He has had his fill, I suppose. Perhaps the memory of his wife is precious enough to sustain him. Perhaps the looming presence of a hawk-nosed, meddlesome detective deters him.
"Oh, god yes," he says, a little too loud. "Your mouth."
He ached in all the best ways. His shoulder was sore from holding the weight of his body up over Sherlock's. His knees felt lightly burned from the friction of the sheets. The muscles in his backside and thighs protested when he bent down to pick up a stray piece of paper from the floor. He had a bite mark below his collarbone: small, round, and perfectly identifiable. And there was the all-over sensation of satisfaction, the release of tension that came from nothing else but an orgasm in the presence— in the arse, John's mind supplied helpfully— of another person.
Holmes was silent for an agonising minute, staring at me. I bit my lip against my own impulse to hide my face or get out of bed. Then he laughed, short and sharp, and took hold of my chin to make me look into his eyes.
Greg and Molly were having a furious, whispered conversation in each other’s ears, their eyes fixed on Sherlock and John, but Sherlock made the decision for them and strode away across the room, leaving John and the sommelier in his wake.
"A couple of biscuits, too," she said, indicating them.  "Sherlock, dear, your kitchen's an absolute wreck, and I don't think I need to remind you—"
I pushed myself to my feet again and fetched another water glass and the empty china wash basin from the dressing table. When he heard them clank on the floor beneath him, he reached out and grabbed whatever he could of me–my elbow–and squeezed it in gratitude. "God bless you, Doctor Watson," he said into the pillow.
"Your bedroom?"
"Well, it's tempting, honestly, but I'm staying on at the Dove until they decide which shift manager they're going to promote."
Sherlock sucked in a breath, hips jerking forward into John's grip. John flashed him a grin, all teeth, and brushed his thumb over the head of Sherlock's prick where it distended the fabric. Sherlock's mouth fell open and his shoulders hunched, all against his will. John's cock was nestled between the cheeks of his arse, the fabric of their briefs a devastating barrier.
"It's mutual," John admitted. "She doesn't pick up when I ring, but then I don't ring. I get an email once in awhile from Clara, carbon-copied to the whole family, letting us know how she's doing, but… I'm not really keeping tabs, honestly."
I turned over onto my side and punched my pillow a few times. It didn't help.
The smell of coffee reached him finally, and he let the curtain drop and turned back to the kitchen. Sherlock appeared at the other doorway, wearing nothing but a dressing gown, and he gave a little start when he saw John wearing the other one. He grinned, soft and amused, as John pushed the sleeves up.
“Do you want--” I gasped, “Can I--?”
Sherlock snorted. "You were wondering."
"Shh," he says, stroking my arms and back, "Holmes, it's all right. It's just me."
"Do you suppose it matters?" he teased, his dark eyes shining at me in the moonlight. I kissed him again, and this time he sank back into my pillows and I leaned over him, supported on my elbow, my other hand running down his long flank.
Holmes leaned over and bit my lip, as if promising nothing of the sort, and as we kissed he rolled so that he was entirely on top of me. His body was a comfortable, welcome weight all along my chest and belly; I relaxed into the sensation of being... not captive, exactly, but captivated. He rolled his hips against mine, driving our pricks together, and our kisses faltered and became more frantic. We rocked slowly together, the heat building, until he stopped all at once and pushed up on his elbows to look down into my face.
“While Dr Watson accused the gentleman of being a thief. I’m sure you can guess which of those charges the constable took more seriously.”
I left Baker Street and went to my brother's. Not directly, of course. Upon my escape from the house, I went immediately around the corner and down the Marylebone Road. I thought I heard Watson calling my name behind me; I ignored it. The street was still crowded, for it was just after midnight on a Friday, and I lost myself in the arms of humanity as I thought and overthought.
"You didn't have to." John went over and laid the files down on the desk, and then pulled the chair out. Other than the bed, it was the only place in the room to sit. Sherlock ignored him and crossed to the bed instead, toeing off his shoes and climbing to sit cross-legged on top of the duvet. He pulled his notebook out of his trouser pocket and a pen from his shirt.
"Sounds like her." Mary sighed. "I should ring her. Catch up a bit."
"You're a menace to society," I tell him, sliding down the bed a little. Feeling with my hands and my mouth, I find my way to his left nipple and begin to give it its due attention. His hand comes down on the back of my head, fingers in my hair, and his breathing gets slow and deep as he arches up into my caresses. I lick and suck until the nipple under my lips is stiff and tender; meanwhile I worry the other between finger and thumb. Holmes is squirming, biting back his whimpers, and when I switch hand and mouth he groans aloud.
Mrs Hudson answered, and I knew it was the constable come to take my statement. I tucked my head under the blankets, wishing for a few more minutes of peace. My cock was hard again, and I stank of sweat and misery.
By the time I reach a familiar intersection, I am sweating and footsore and deep into a downtown that bustles with activity and noise, flying cars and weird fashion. In my plain shirt and trousers I am practically invisible. The village green looks nothing like I remember it: the grass has been half-paved over and a metal sculpture installed in the middle is swarming with children. But beyond the green is the church, exactly as I knew it. It is old and carefully kept, like a piece of cloth that has been washed again and again until it is translucent. The churchyard that surrounds it is intact, too. My heart sticks in my throat.
"I should get back," John said, pushing away from the little table. "Sherlock's been going a bit mental about the menu and he'll need me to talk him out of turning everything into foam."
"To the new year," said he, lifting his glass and handing me mine. We touched rims and sipped, and I smiled at the pink flush of heat rising in his face.
Sherlock Holmes was too interesting to ignore.
I told him about the cab, glossed over the fact that I'd been in Watson's lap for a glorious few minutes, and explained what Watson had told me.
“I need you to–” he began, and cut himself off with an annoyed huff.
"What do you want, Harry? Why'd you come here?"
. With more focus on the narrator and his cock, I couldn’t help but picture my own and the gentle, generous mouth of my good Doctor. He was warm and sweet and always took his time.
"Sorry, Chef," they muttered.
"About getting the wrong impression?"
"These are men's rings," he said. He tried to put one on and it got stuck just below his second knuckle.
"This is ridiculous," he said, tossing the whisk down. "We're done."
The shower shut off, and John heard Sherlock move from the washroom to the bedroom and bang around in there for a bit. When Sherlock emerged a few minutes later, impeccable in a slim-cut navy suit and stark white shirt, buttoning the cuff of his shirt, he stopped dead at the sight of John at the window.
"And, Sherlock," Jim went on, "you must be so proud to finally have found someone who will put up with you, is that right?"
John pointed a finger in his direction. "Not helpful," he said.
"Would— Would you like to talk about it?" Sherlock offered. It sounded like it pained him.
Something in his face changed very subtly, something about his eyebrows twitched, and he said, "I suppose not," almost as if he didn't believe me. He smiled, though, and said, "The next train as it twenty past three. Do you think you could stand it?"
John didn’t seem the type to initiate something so ridiculous, but he would have gone along with it for a laugh.
"All right," John said, "I went to the loo and then I talked to Sarah about how's she's getting on with the bar. It took about six minutes, so don't try that intimidation stuff with me. Are they done in there already?"
“Very well,” I agreed, as my own stomach began to rumble. “I can’t argue with that.”
"I do enjoy watching," I admitted. "I don't know."
"John, please."
His hips were moving in little circles, pushing into my hand.
"You're the judge of character."
I thought about my first wedding: the details were still sharp and clear in my mind. I pictured Mary's shy smile as our eyes met at either end of the aisle; I could almost smell her perfume as I approached; I remembered the lace on the sleeves of her dress and the little silk flowers on the gossamer veil that covered her hair. She'd been the most beautiful woman I'd ever seen on that day. After she'd died I'd kept that memory locked up tight, but it wasn't as painful as I'd expected to take it out again and examine it. It was a shame my second wedding couldn't even be pieced together enough to form a coherent whole.
"Ready?" he asked. "Holmes, I… I will be very careful, but if you want me to stop at any point, just… please say so."
