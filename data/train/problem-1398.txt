“Hey, Greg.  Yeah, I’m feeling fine, thanks.  Had a great rest in the old family pile.  Even managed to get his lordship here to take it easy for a while, though he’s raring to go again now.”
“I’d like to taste you.  Will you let me?”
It was by this time in his deductions that Greg and John arrived back.  John came straight over to Sherlock to find out what had been happening.  Sherlock could see that he was obviously worried that they had done something wrong when hanging the light yesterday, so he drew John off to one side, away from the others, and started straight in.
Sherlock laughed.  “I know, but I promise I’ll make it worth your while.”
Sherlock watched Oliver as he played the scene and noticed that his eyes kept flicking over to Natalie, who was playing Miss Casewell, to see if she was watching him.  She did glance at him, and smiled when she did it, which seemed to perk him up so he obviously had an interest in her.  Sherlock could tell, though, that Natalie was also watching Jasmine and Freddie as well as Oliver; Freddie with a look of wanting and Jasmine with a strong sense of dislike.  That instantly told him a lot about their particular dynamics.  He would have to tell John about it later to get it confirmed, and to impress John with his observations, as he had found there was nothing better than that look of admiration in John’s eyes.
"Me, take things too far - have you met you?"
“That would be really nice actually.  I’d like to hear about some of your other cases.  How did you know it was my army mates I was supposed to be meeting?”
Sherlock knocked his heels into Mystery and he was off.  John was very close behind and, much to Sherlock’s surprise, he seemed to stay there easily, not losing any ground as Sherlock sensed him right beside him.  When Sherlock took a moment to look across, he saw that John was poised up on his toes, knees tucked in, bottom out of the saddle and leaning hunched forward over King, perfectly balanced.  John had been keeping secrets from him it seemed.  He spurred Mystery on, trying to keep ahead of John, but the other boy matched him length for length.  When they finally approached the copse, and had to slow down, it was a dead heat.
“Me too, John.  I hated doing all that without you.  We’re a team and we work so much better together.  It was like I was missing a limb not having you there.”
The Best Day Of My Life
“I wish I could, John, believe me.  It was important that we got the three snipers out of the way before we could make a move.  Mrs Hudson’s was easy – it was the handyman doing repairs in the flat and he packed up and left when he got the all-clear.  It was easy for me to pick him up after he left.  DI Lestrade’s took a little longer.  Sherlock worked his way through the personnel records of the entire department and found out that one of the recent transferees had got himself into a heap of trouble and been blackmailed into helping Moriarty or have his indiscretions revealed.  I soon had him transferred out again and dealt with so the Inspector is safe.”
John cleared their table, taking the tray back to the counter, only to be hustled away by Mrs Hudson.
Sherlock laughed and then he lifted the hip on top and pushed back so that John’s cock slid in between the gap, and then he lowered his hip back down to trap it there.  John groaned at the tight feeling and instinctively pushed his pelvis forward in a rocking movement.  It made his cock rub against the base of Sherlock’s sac on each pass which started Sherlock moaning as well.  John loved the warmth of feeling himself between Sherlock’s thighs.  All of a sudden, Sherlock pulled forward, stretching John’s cock with him for a moment before it sprang back, whilst Sherlock jumped out of bed.  He turned to look at John and had to laugh at the bereft, kicked-puppy look on John’s face.
Oh, no!  It must be someone who didn’t know Sherlock was …   He stopped there, he didn’t even like to think that word.  He wondered why they were texting Sherlock on this old phone and not his own.  Well, it wouldn’t hurt now; he might as well see from whom they originated.  Maybe he could at least pass on the message to them about what had happened.
“It’s quite alright, John.  I’m sure the rumour mills have been working overtime.”
“What, Sherlock?  We already decided we weren’t going to try that yet.”
John spoke the first words he had uttered since he’d arrived home.  “Best day of my life!”
“I’m sure there is a vehicle around here that could be commandeered into service.  Where?”
“You can take me up or down.”
Sherlock could see that John needed some time to absorb what he had just learned so he stepped aside and allowed John to sidle past him.
The Holmes brothers had attended tonight as Mycroft’s informant had suspected that the wife was the liaison for the General himself.  After only a few moments watching her confident manner, Sherlock realised that this woman was no mere liaison, she was the instigator of the plot herself.  Mycroft had told Sherlock that the General had been working with Whitehall on some top secret military plans and they had thought that he was secretly trying to pass the details on to a foreign power.  Sherlock could tell that was not the case.
“What’s this all about, Mycroft?  Sherlock is waiting for me.”
“’Mazing.  There’s no-one like you, you’re brilliant, you are.”
“It definitely looked a bit more authentic in the scenes where we had some props added.  So if you could get everything sorted ready for the later scenes as well, Sherlock, that would be great, and I think it would help to pull the performances together.”  Sherlock nodded, already planning exactly how he wanted things properly set up ready for the next session.
John cut in before he could get any further.  “He’s alive, Mycroft.  I know he’s alive.  Now, tell me where the hell he is so I can go and help him before he gets hurt.”
Sherlock hummed but didn’t push John for a further answer.
“Didn’ tell ‘em anythin’.  Never betray Sh’r…”
Sherlock sealed his puncture wound and licked all of John’s release, pressing kisses to his lower stomach as he went.  John took a little longer to finish; even though he could make himself stop on command now, he loved the special contact it allowed him with Sherlock so much that he was often loath to let it go.  He eventually pulled out and cleaned Sherlock up too.  He swung himself round and rested his head on Sherlock’s chest, cuddling up to the man who had come to mean everything to him.
They followed the course of the stream and soon found themselves gravitating towards each other as they had been doing all week.  Sherlock reached out to hold John’s hand, tentatively at first, until he saw the broad answering grin on John’s face, then more boldly, squeezing the fingers in his own.  John nudged him with his shoulder and grinned as he held on tight to stop Sherlock stumbling in surprise.
“There is a reason, and I can see quite clearly by looking at you that it isn’t your reason.  It’s that pompous arse, Mycroft, isn’t it?”
The nurse nodded gratefully to Sherlock and followed the doctor out of the room.  She sat down at the desk outside the observation window so she would be able to keep an eye on John and her other patients whilst still leaving John and Sherlock some privacy.
He could still remember that day.  It had been Sherlock’s sixteenth birthday and John had just received his acceptance letter for the army.  He’d come to Sherlock’s party to tell him his news and let him know that now that Sherlock was of age, he wanted them to be together and that he would wait for Sherlock until he was ready.  He had thought that his time away in the army would allow Sherlock to mature and decide if John was the person with whom he wanted to spend his life.  John already knew, for certain, that Sherlock was the only man for him and now he was prepared to wait for Sherlock to make his own decision.
“Hello Mummy.  This is John.  His dad works here now and we’re going to examine the soil samples we just collected in the park.”
“Delicate?  I can barely open my eyes.”
The final dress rehearsal went badly, but everyone assured each other that a bad dress rehearsal was a good thing, as that meant the performance, itself, was sure to be a hit.  It had just been lots of silly things.  Freddie had completely dried and forgotten his lines when he had been talking to John just after he had arrived.  Luckily, John had taken it in his stride and, after including part of Freddie’s line in with his own, Freddie had recovered enough to carry on.  One of the props they’d needed hadn’t been put back in the right place at the end of the previous session, and Anderson had told Sherlock off, in supposed mutters, backstage.  This had been clearly heard front of house and put Oliver off his speech.  Needless to say, Sherlock had clearly pointed out that it had been Anderson who had moved the prop, when he had been mooning over Sally before they’d left the night before, and, of course, he was proved correct.  Anderson had sloped off in a sulk, knocking into the back of one of the doors on stage.  That had forced it open so that it nearly trapped the hand of Natalie, who had been standing behind it at the time.  Matthew had dropped his skis as he’d arrived, and he and Freddie had banged heads as they’d both bent down at the same time to pick them up.  They’d both been fine afterwards, but it was another hold-up to the show which they obviously hoped wouldn’t happen on the night.
John’s hand flew to his neck to check his pulse but he couldn’t feel anything there.  He tried his wrist and put his hand over his heart, but still nothing.  He held his breath but it had no effect on him; he didn’t go blue in the face or end up gasping.  He looked at Sherlock, stunned, not able to accept the evidence that was in front of his own eyes.  He shook his head and scrambled back ‘til he was pressed up against the headboard.
Sherlock shooed John away, but the gesture was softened by a slight lifting of the corner of his mouth, and John knew that Sherlock had acknowledged his concern.  John went to wait behind the door for his entry and Sherlock stood behind the prop table, running the performance through his head again; trying to think what had put him on alert.
“Well, am I doing something wrong?”
John was feeling a bit hungry now without breakfast so he helped himself.
Matthew was leaning against one of the tables and his hand twitched, reflexively, towards his leg; the wound had healed, but it was still red and ached on occasion.
“Come on then.  Let’s blow this joint.  I have an amazing dream I would like to re-enact and I’d like to be fully awake enough to remember it this time.”
“No, I want to stay here.”
He wanted to leave a message of his own for John.  It was the least he could do.  He wanted John to hear him admit his own feelings, but he also wanted to be there to hear it.  What could he do?  He would leave a message on Sunday morning, just in case John tried to retrieve his messages remotely before Sherlock got there.  He smiled to himself thinking that didn’t seem likely, though, if John still had the same issues with technology that Sherlock remembered.  Then he would go over to Baker Street and wait for John to get back from Harry’s.  When John played back the message Sherlock would be right there and he could hear John’s reaction.  Yes, that’s what he would do.
(Part 2 of Do You Want To Know A Secret)
“Greg laughed semi-hysterically as he got up.  “Tell anyone – are you crazy?  No-one would believe it – hell, even I don’t believe it and I’ve seen it.
“Cut the bullshit, Mycroft.  You know exactly why I’m here.”
“You heard about that?”
“I have done it a few times when I’ve been injured.  I have also done it during sexual intercourse.  As I believe I mentioned it can heighten the pleasure both for the other person and for myself.  The taste of human blood from the source, as it were, is simply delicious; some incredibly more so than others."
“If she was, I can’t believe that she would put it into a drink she was having at a party.  She would be more likely to take it privately in her room if that was necessary.  Plus I would have seen if she did that as she was sitting right next to you and she didn’t touch her cup until she gave it to you.  If she had known it contained her medication then she wouldn’t have passed it on to anyone else, would she?”
Mrs Hudson got out a flat cardboard cake box which she gave to Sherlock to fold out into a usable container within which to send the cakes to John.  He inserted the correct tabs into the right slots and he soon had a sturdy box ready.  It had special inserts to hold the cupcakes so he put the three he had set aside for John into place and it left him room for one more thing to add so he decided to do something special with the pastry.
John laughed, “Well, I’m glad I could entertain.”
“Okay, in that case, the game is on.”
“That’s certainly true in Anderson’s case, but that wasn’t what I was referring to.  John, I…  There’s something I need to tell you.  It’s something I’ve never told anyone before and I need you to not freak out.”
"If you insist on making ridiculous pop culture references you know I will have no idea to what you are referring or to what you could possibly think I have to learn either for that matter."
“Nothing.”  John was bright red now, his head hanging low as he avoided Sherlock’s eye.
“Who controls your body, Sherlock?”
John was the first aider for the production so he carefully pulled up the material to expose Matthew's leg, and saw a long cut down the back of his calf.  Fortunately, it was only a superficial skin wound and it didn't appear to go too deeply into the muscles below.  John took a pad and a bandage from the first aid box, which was kept in the corner of the room, and wrapped his leg for him.  Greg was standing right by them so John got him to hold crossed arms with him, and Anderson helped Matthew to stand up and put his arms around their necks.  He sat on their joined hands and they carried him out and across to the Nurse's Office for him to have his leg examined properly.
“I won’t be able to endure the holidays if I don’t have some way to get in touch with you, at least.”
Sherlock smiled shyly.  He’d been hoping that he could play for John tonight.  He had written something special in all his extra ‘alone’ time and he wanted John to hear it and know what he thought; to see, in fact, if he would recognise that the piece Sherlock had composed was about them.
“Sherlock, is there something I can help you with?”
Unfortunately, near the drinks table, stood Sherlock's cousins.  He'd already had a barrage of teasing from the two who had been staying with them, but now they were reinforced by the others, too, so Sherlock knew he would be in for a fresh assault.
“He was talking to one of the girls in class on Thursday about what she was going to wear to the dance and he gave her some helpful suggestions about how to wrap the dress around in a different way that belied a knowledge he wouldn’t have had simply from observation.”
Mary smiled at him, smirking slightly as she added, “I’ve always thought so,” with a little wink.
“It was a pleasure.  It’s nice to see people so enthusiastic and using their skills to achieve their objectives.  I can’t wait to come and see the play now and admire your handiwork on stage.”
“I was very nicely warm when I woke up and I certainly don’t drop off in that manner on a normal occasion so what you say might be true.  I’m sure your girlfriends don’t usually complain.”
“No, we couldn’t!  We’d never get away with that.  I suppose we could check with the Nurse to see if she has anything missing from her supplies, or if anyone has been prescribed any such pills?”
“Forever, John.  You won’t be able to get rid of me.”
“Do you remember anything about yesterday at all?”
He had to make the most of Tuesday nights.  His parents always went away on Tuesdays and, since they’d first started school, Sherlock had arranged for John to sleep over at his house on a Tuesday night and they went to school together on Wednesday morning.  Mycroft had been in the house when they were younger but, luckily for them, when he’d gone away to university they had been allowed to continue as Sherlock’s parents said that John was a good influence.  There was also a housekeeper around so it wasn’t as if they were totally abandoned or John’s parents might not have been so keen to allow two boys in a house on their own, but it had always worked out.
“Your wish is my command.  Shall I relieve you of these?  Delightful as that silk feels, I’m sure what’s underneath will be even better.”
"Okay, okay, I'm joking.  You're going to love this.  He was genuinely, distantly related to the great Scottish doctor and inventor of penicillin, Alexander Fleming and he was actually named after his illustrious relative."
“It’s ok, John, as you say, it’s our little secret.”
“Now, we’ll see what you have to say for yourself.”
“I dare you to ring Mycroft and tell him he’s the bestest big brother in the whole wide world and you looooovvve him,” John pursed his lips and made some kissy faces at Sherlock.
“What’s the big rush?”
"I'll get it this time," Sherlock offered.
Sherlock had set up a prop table, just as he wanted, and it was laid out with sectioned squares and every prop in its place so it was easily accessible, as required, for each scene.  The costumes were altered and ready and everyone had tried them on.  They hadn't had a dress rehearsal yet, they were waiting to do that in the next week or so as opening night was rapidly approaching.
"Well, aren't you a handsome fellow."
Do u want this address or not?  I’ll be in my usual place for the next few days unless I get moved on again. Billy.
He obviously counted John and himself out of the suspicions, along with Greg and Matthew.  Greg was too invested in the production to sabotage it, or its stars, in any way, and Matthew had looked genuinely surprised and reacted instantaneously when he'd heard the noise.  Which left him with Sally and Anderson to consider?  Sally was looking annoyed at the disturbance and had quickly come over to check the damage to their props.  She’d been ignoring Jasmine's hysterics as much as possible.  Anderson appeared harassed and was chasing around after her, trying to help, but mainly just getting in the way.
“I will assist you, John, of course.”
“I’ll get back to you on that.  Keep in touch, Billy.”
John got off the bus when they reached the stop nearest to the Baker Street tube.  He was physically shivering now as the cold wind blew against his wet clothing.  He was finding it hard to get his legs to cooperate and start walking the half mile home; his psychosomatic limp had even decided to make a surprise appearance, too, just to finish him off.  He eventually managed to instigate a sort of shuffling hobble back home which took him twice as long as his regular pace.
Mycroft made a quick phone call to get everything set up then John followed him down to the basement level to a surveillance centre and armoury.
John smiled back shyly and gestured to Sherlock’s neck.  “Sorry about that.  I don’t know quite how I managed that.”
“Sure, John, we’ll come out for a stroll, won’t we, Mols?”
Your John
Stop it!  The thoughts kept spiralling round and round in his head.  Sherlock had obviously thought he was alone in what he was facing and that nobody believed him but that wasn’t true.  John had always believed him, and believed in him.  He had known that Moriarty was real – he’d felt the semtex strapped to his body, for God’s sake; heard that evil voice hissing in his ear.  That was no fake actor; that was a true madman.
“Fine, Mr Politically Correct.  You need to have your cravings under control before we venture forth amongst those upstanding members of the human race who inhabit our fair city.  Is that better?”
"That's really not necessary, John.  The skull that I have already received was excellent, and will suffice for both occasions."
"That will entirely depend on how well you do, won't it, so why don't you give it your best shot and we'll see how we go."
“You’re not that bad, Sherlock.  You shouldn’t listen to all those people like Anderson; they’re just idiots.”
John put his coat on and heading out.  He managed a grateful smile to the receptionist when she told him that Sarah had rung in to say she was feeling better and would be back tomorrow so he didn’t have to come in again until his next scheduled shift on Friday.  It was the first pleasant thing that had happened all day.  Maybe things were finally looking up.
“Well thank you for telling me everything.  I’m still a bit gobsmacked by the whole thing, if I’m honest; I don’t think I’ve taken it all in fully.”
John allowed it for a while, knowing how thorough Sherlock liked to be, and then he wanted to taste for himself, so he followed Sherlock’s tongue back into his own mouth.  Sherlock found he liked that just as much and sucked on the tip of John’s tongue, wanting to keep it there and see if the taste differed in his own mouth.  They eventually pulled apart to properly catch their breaths.
“I’ll be right back, John, just hang on a minute.”
"It only seems to be where you're concerned; I don't think anyone else would say that."
John walked off; his head spinning with the news that Sherlock was actually alive.  He thought about it all for a moment.  Now that he knew what was going on, he needed to find a way to get to Sherlock to help him in whatever he was doing.  He wouldn’t let his friend do this alone.  John was the one with all the army training; the one who was a crack shot.  It should be him out there, not Sherlock.  That had always been his role; Sherlock was the brains and he was the brawn.  Well, he considered himself a little higher than brawn but certainly he was the one who was prepared to do the dirty jobs; to get things done.
That was all it took.  Sherlock slowly pulled out and then, holding tightly to John's hips, he pushed back in in one hard stroke and they both moaned deep in their throats to feel the pressure.  Sherlock couldn't hold back and was soon thrusting into John, alternating a few long, deep passes with several short, hard pulses and they were both sweating and panting and desperate to come.
“You need to get me in there, Mycroft.  He must have been captured and they’ve been searching his room to see if they can find out about him.”
"What about you?  Don't think I didn't notice you biting your knuckle at one point to try and muffle the noise."
"I'm ready, John.  I've been ready since the beginning.  I may not have done this before, but I'm not a total innocent.  I looked it up on the internet and I want it all; I want do everything - with you."
The last three months of school did that weird thing where, even though each day seemed to be the longest thing imaginable, when you looked back at it the time seemed to have passed without them realising it had gone.  They’d had all their final exams now and the only thing left was the Leaver’s Ball this evening.
He realised exactly where he’d be going for his next port of call.  There was only one person that would have the kind of power to make him ‘Almighty’ and John knew Sherlock didn’t mean God.
“Your favourite?  You mean, it’s not your only house, then?”
With any luck I should be getting some leave next month as I haven’t had any time off yet.  Would you be up to meeting up at all whilst I’m off? It would be nice to properly put a face to your most treasured name.  As I’ll only be over for a few days, I’ll probably have to stay with my sister but I’m sure that, if previous occasions are any indication, I will be more than happy to escape at every opportunity, so I could see you whenever you happened to be free.
"Oh, my young Padawan; you have much to learn."
Sherlock drew out the last note and remained still for a long moment, his arms held steady as the echo faded.  He finally opened his eyes and looked down at John and was stunned to see that John had tears in his eyes.
“How would it work then?”
They discussed options and decided to just leave one person to keep a watch on the office building and the rest of that team would rendezvous with John’s group and they could divide the search of the warehouses between them.  The teams split in two to get the work done faster and John’s team went over to the first warehouse to investigate.
Jasmine gasped at this point.  “Me?”
“Well done, John, you did it, and on your first day, too.”
“I doubt that seeing me again would finish John off – he’s made of sterner stuff.”  Sherlock smiled wryly, “whether my face will survive the encounter intact, however, is another matter.”
When had this happened?  How had this happened?  Why had this happened when he wasn’t there?  Had it only happened because he wasn’t there?  Was it only posthumous pondering or current fact?  Why didn’t he have any of these answers?  Why wasn’t he in front of John right now so that he could deduce the answers to all of these questions?  Although, that might not be possible even if John was here; personal emotions had always been a problem for him to deduce, especially if they involved John.  Ask him what John had eaten for breakfast, if he had a date, whether he’d slept badly – anything like that and he could tell you in an instant without even having to think about it.  Ask him if he ever thought John would love him and he’d have stared at you blankly wondering what you’d taken.
When John woke up the next morning Sherlock was already awake and watching him.  He smiled at Sherlock and enjoyed the soft crinkling of the eyes as Sherlock smiled back.  As he stretched he realised that the tentative touch from the night before had now progressed to complete hand holding.  Knowing that Sherlock would have had ample opportunity to move his hand before John awoke and had obviously decided not to, John decided to take his courage with both hands and find out why.
"Oh I'm sure I could manage whatever you have.  Something that could keep up with Mystery, maybe; I'm sure you like to give him a good run."
“I have plenty to do, thank you very much.  I don’t need you around to do what I want.”
John looked intrigued as he thought about it.  When he had come back to himself after Sherlock had pinched his neck he had loved the feeling of the warm blood going down his throat and was only sorry that he hadn’t been more aware when the bite was actually happening.  Did he want to mess up what he had with Sherlock, though?  He was happier now than he had ever been and he didn’t want to spoil anything.
As Sherlock spun them round he saw that John was quite correct.  Jenkins was kissing the lady’s hand and bowing as the piece of music came to an end.  Rather than head back to the table towards the group to whom he had attached himself for the evening to gain entry, he was making his way over towards the exit.
Sherlock spun round.  John only called him an idiot when he was exasperated but still impressed despite himself, never when he was angry.  He wasn’t going to leave him.  Sherlock made as if to come towards John but John stopped him, pointing at his chair.
“I find myself in complete agreement with that statement.”
John winked at Sherlock, knowing that only the two of them knew how literal that actually was.  Sherlock smirked back at him then turned to Greg.
"That was astounding.  You got all that from a quick view of my wallet and a few spoken words?  The town I grew up in is Shrewsbury, by the way, which is about 10 miles from the Welsh border so you got it spot on.  Lots of my friends here have never heard of it, and do think I sound Welsh.  My rugby mates, especially, like to ask me if I'm fond of shagging sheep."
by Joolz
“That is rather limiting me, John.  Experimentation can be used in so many different ways, are you sure you wouldn’t like to experience some of them?”
“Yes, that would be brilliant.  I want to try it with you inside me next time.”
Jasmine sat listening and then mimed turning off the radio and she sat thinking for a moment.  Freddie, who was playing her husband, Giles, came into the room through what would be the door into the hall and they started in with their conversation.  As the first guests to their newly opened guest house were arriving today, they were both a bit nervous as to how it would go, and they both played the emotions quite well, for a first attempt.
Two of Mycroft’s team led Moran out, shouting and complaining all the way.
A week passed and Sherlock and John had very little time alone together.  They managed to sneak off occasionally to what they now thought of as their little alcove where they could snatch a few kisses between lessons but their timetable was fairly well filled and John did several extra-curricular activities too which took up time in his evenings.  He tried to get Sherlock involved in some of them but there was absolutely no way Sherlock was playing rugby.   The only one he could possibly see himself getting involved in, if he had to, was the drama club.  He certainly had a flair for the dramatic and learning lines would be child’s play.  Did he want to put in the effort to join in group activities though?  If the result got him more time with John than he supposed his only answer would have to be an eventual yes.
I’ll look forward to hearing from you again next year. (It always sounds so weird when you say that, doesn’t it, when you know [or certainly hope] you’ll be hearing from someone soon).  Never mind me; just being silly.
“Idiot”, John said fondly, as he couldn’t help laughing as well.  “Seriously, though, can I ask you what’s changed?”
“What does this mean for Jasmine then?  Was it just a silly prank or was someone trying to hurt her?  Who would have access to those sorts of pills?”
“I’d put that squash ball under my arm and used the pressure to stop the pulse temporarily when you checked it.  It was so hard feeling you so close and not being able to react, John, but it had to be convincing for the sniper trained on you.”
“You were right; it was from what I heard you playing before.  A recurring phrase just caught my fancy so I was messing around with it.  It wasn’t something I had heard before.  Who was the composer?”
“This is John Watson leaving a message for Sherlock Holmes.  I have to believe you are out there in the Universe somewhere.  The world couldn’t exist without you in some form.  I know I can’t.  I just…  Why didn’t you let me help you if you were struggling?  Nobody would truly believe that shit Moriarty spewed out – we could have fought it.  I could have done something…  Anyway, one of these steps I’m supposed to follow tells me to ask forgiveness and to reach out to people I’ve wronged so I just wanted to say I’m sorry that I couldn’t do more and give you what you needed.  I really miss you, Sherlock.”
Sherlock shook his head.  “Does it bother you that I haven’t?”
Sherlock brought him his drink just as the bell rang downstairs.  John watched as Sherlock went downstairs – voluntarily - and came back up carrying takeaway from their favourite Chinese restaurant.  He plated up their meals and sat down next to John and proceeded to actually eat most of his meal with John looking on, blinking bemusedly.  When they were done Sherlock took out their plates, made them each a cup of tea and put on a James Bond movie as he sat back down next to John and pulled John’s head down to rest on his shoulder.
He could feel the softness of Sherlock’s hair against his upper arm and smell the expensive shampoo so close to his nose.  He’d love to run his fingers through that hair.  He could picture Sherlock lying on the sofa with his head in John’s lap, John running his fingers through it in a way that would relax them both.  So many things he wanted to do but he daren’t ever let Sherlock know how he felt.  He would rather spend his time quietly pining about Sherlock in the flat than to risk giving everything away and be forever without him.
"In a few moments she will notice the policeman I saw further up the street four minutes ago who should be just about to come round that corner any time now and then she will call him over.  At which point our friend across the way is going to move even more rapidly to the right and lose himself in that crowd around the uni-cyclist.  He will consider that a safe enough distance at which to start a fast-paced walk to make his exit down an alley halfway along that street with his ill-gotten gains."
“Hmmm, we shall see.  Why don’t you lie down now and sleep this off.  Hopefully when you wake up you’ll be feeling more normal.”
“My second cup was blue, but I didn’t drink it because it got spilt, and I ended up with that cup that Jasmine gave me, do you remember?”
It didn’t take long 'til both of them were nearing their climax.  Sherlock wanted John to come first as this was all about him so he tightened his inner muscles, squeezing John on each thrust.  That was enough to set John off and he cried out as he emptied himself inside Sherlock.  Sherlock kept pumping his hips feverishly, rubbing his cock against John’s body.  When John was recovered enough to open his eyes he looked up at Sherlock and smiled his special smile that showed Sherlock that he was the most important person in John’s life.  That smile meant more to Sherlock than anything and it was all he needed to tip him over and he was coming all over John’s stomach.
He sent men in undercover to infiltrate the region to look for you and they got word that there were a unit of rebels who had a white doctor with them, treating some of their soldiers.  He managed to find out that you were captured by the people who shot you down and were being held as a hostage whilst they waited to see if you lived or died.  When you partially recovered from your own injury you were press-ganged into helping their soldiers as and when they got injured.
"Are you kidding me?  You are absolutely gorgeous, Sherlock, how can you have gone this long without anyone wanting to kiss you?"
"Well, that nicely filled a gap," John smiled, "Would you like another drink after all that?"
Sherlock did the same with all of John’s fingers then he sucked at the skin between the thumb and first finger, slipping his tongue between them and biting down on the adjoining skin.  His tongue circled the palm, flicking up occasionally to taste one of the other inter-spaces between John’s fingers before sliding back down again.  He bit into the skin at the base of John’s thumb and sucked a love bite on to the surface, soothing the skin again as John gasped.
They left it overnight and then went back the next day to give it a second coat.  It really was looking really good now and, when it was completely dry tomorrow, they could fix in the light and dial which had arrived on Saturday morning and it would be finished.
"Really, John?  Royalty and weddings - does that sound like something I would like?"
“Good morning.  Did you sleep well?  How are you feeling?”
“Oh, thank you; that’s really nice of you.  Are you sure?”
“You were watching me?”
John was soon set up at a poker table with a large pile of chips which he only succeeded in increasing as the evening progressed.  He had been there about an hour when he got word through his earpiece that Moran had been spotted approaching the casino.  John had sat himself so that he was side-on to the entrance.  He never liked to have his back to the door but he didn’t want to be tempted to look for Moran; he wanted the man to spot him and make the approach.
The boys grinned at him.  They had ordered an old radio dial from an internet parts supply store which should be arriving this weekend.  They weren’t bothered that it didn’t work they just wanted it to make their radio look good.  They had drilled two holes in it already for a little orange light bulb that Mr Johnson had had lying around.  They had rigged it up with an on/off switch to make it light up, so Sherlock would be able to see when the light came on from where he would be standing in the wings, and know to start his broadcast announcement.
“I suppose so.”
Mycroft smirked at him, “As if you would.”  He reached into his drawer and pulled out a memory stick which he held out.  As Sherlock grabbed it, Mycroft held on for a moment longer.
Dear John
Sherlock joined John at lunch too, sitting with a group of John’s friends.  He didn’t interact with them much, content to just spend his time with John.  He didn’t eat much except when John looked at him as if in query and then he’d take a bite.  John smiled, seeming to be happy to have him there but not pushing him into more than he was ready for and also not insisting that he deduce everyone as had been done to him at other places where it had almost felt as if he was being pimped out for their amusement.
“I wish you could come with me, John.  I hate having to spend so much time with my family.  I always thought Mycroft was bad enough, but even he pales into insignificance in comparison to the rest of them.”
John,
“You do what you need to do and I’ll go and get your pyjamas for you.”
“Sure.”
“It seems that even Moriarty was aware of your value to my brother.”
By the time they had gone through all the shelves, they had amassed quite a collection of props and nearly filled the whole list.  Sherlock put a couple of things back which weren’t quite what he was looking for, but luckily there were alternatives that they could use instead.  The only other things missing now, aside from the radio, were a pistol and a set of skis.  Mike had an idea about one of those.
“There we are Sir, all shipshape and ready to go.  If you’ll excuse me, I’ll just be off to check the next officer now.  Thank you, goodbye.”  With that, he spun round on his heels and was back out through the door before anyone could say anything; leaving them with dropped jaws and shocked expressions.
“Eurghhhhh.”
“You seem chilled as well as being in shock, John; take my coat as we don’t seem to have any of those lovely orange blankets to hand.”
The day of their last performance was finally upon them and everyone was very excited.
Sherlock was groaning freely and John was enjoying the way his head was straining back against the pillow as he tried to allow John as much access as possible.  When John had finished one side he moved across to the other and did the same thing all over again; admiring the pretty pattern he was making.  He was happy to see the possessive marks, wanting everyone to know that Sherlock was his; but he knew, realistically, that Sherlock would have to make full usage of his coat collar and scarf if they had a case in the next couple of days.
He darted his tongue out so it touched the tented material covering the hard shaft in front of him.  There was a small wet dot just at the top, where John’s cock was already leaking as if in anticipation and Sherlock could taste it.  He needed to move those pyjama pants out of the way; he needed to feel the real thing in his mouth – right now!  If he was going to feel guilt for an imagined transgression against John’s assumed wishes then he was going to make it worthwhile.  He pulled the soft cotton down and pressed his tongue into the little slit and groaned low in his throat as the small droplet washed over his taste buds.  It was divine.  The aroma was strong and concentrated so close to the body.   It was John, but more so.  Sherlock circled around the top and then slid his tongue down one side, around the base and up the other, repeating the movements as he felt John pushing against him.  This was bliss.
“Come on, John.”
“No, I stand by what I said.”  So saying, he raised his arms above his head and John fastened his wrists together, looping the tie around the headboard to keep Sherlock securely in place.
“I’m making some Valentine cakes and some jam tarts.”
Sherlock nodded.  "Yes, I'd like that."
He finally found it within the inner lining of the left cuff.  There was a smooth fold of material which looked natural from a distance but when John tugged it gently a tiny strip of Velcro pulled apart.  Inside was a folded piece of paper which, when John opened it, revealed a page of their secret code in Sherlock’s own handwriting.  John screwed his eyes tightly shut to stop anything leaking out – honestly what was the matter with him today?
"Stupid, of course, sorry, John.  I have some blood bags here for you."
It answered on the second ring.
That couldn’t be right, could it?  He must have mistranslated it.  He went back again and looked at what he had written and the code word that he had used and made sure he had transposed the letters correctly.  It was all there.  He hadn’t made a mistake.  He read the letter through once more.
“What?  How do you know that?  Did you see me?”
“But, John…  I need more.”
John escorted their families over to the seats they had reserved, at this point, and left the two mothers getting better acquainted.  He and Sherlock went backstage to get ready for the performance.  Sherlock squeezed John’s shoulders as they went behind the curtains and grinned down at him; it had all worked out perfectly, and they would get to be together again very soon.
“Not here.  Would we be able to get some from the office?”
“I suppose I’d better see if I can stand on my own today and make it over to the bathroom.”  He started to push himself up off the bed but winced when the movement put pressure on his ribs.
He had made sure to capture John’s attention before they’d started their walks just to prove that he could; that it wasn’t just the night that had drawn John in.  He had shown John what he was capable of and enjoyed the unreserved enthusiasm John had for his deductions which provided its own extra joy to him as people rarely, if ever, reacted positively towards his observations.  It didn’t seem to matter whether the deductions were personal details about John or an in depth analysis of the latest crime scene, John was just awed by Sherlock’s skill and didn’t hesitate to tell him so.  John had been living with him long enough to also know all his bad habits and nothing seemed to scare him away; not even the head in the fridge had garnered more than resigned exasperation.  Now he was just waiting for John to make his move.
Sherlock laughed.  "I'm sure your skills are multitudinous, Doctor Watson.  I certainly look forward to finding out."
“What do they usually say?”
"Indeed.  I can't remember when I've looked forward to an evening more."
“Well, I don’t know about you, but I think I deserve to see what those incredible lips taste like.”
“I really should, shouldn’t I.”  He smiled and took another sip.  “Thank you, Sherlock.  This is lovely.  Just what I needed.”
“So you pull away because you like me too much not because you don’t like me enough?”
“No, nothing else.  Bye, Mycroft.”
“Sherlock.  I have to admit the truth to myself and accept my feelings.  So here goes…  The truth is… I love you.  I think I’ve always loved you in some way, right from the first day when you stood in the lab and deduced everything about me.  You said that first night at Angelo’s that you were married to your work so I was too scared to say anything and spoil what we had, but I should have done.  Even to have the chance with you would have been worth it.  I know it’s too late now, but I just wanted to let you know so that the truth is out there.  I love you, Sherlock Holmes.”
On the next question, John was still reeling from the sensations of that kiss and wasn't concentrating properly and he got it wrong.  Sherlock looked at John and raised his eyebrow, shaking his head slowly.  He bent towards John's neck and John thought he was still going to get a kiss out of it but instead, all he felt was hot breath on his skin.  Sherlock hovered over his neck but didn't get close enough to touch.  John shivered at the breath and tried lifting his shoulder to reach Sherlock's mouth but Sherlock pulled his head back and kept it at the same distance to John's skin the whole time, teasing but not touching.
“Best apology ever.”
“Wait a minute; you’re *that* Holmes!”
“I really do, Little Brother.”
John Watson lay in his hospital bed thinking that his life was pretty much over.  All his hopes and dreams lay as shattered as the bone and muscle in his stupid shoulder.  He had been alone for about an hour now, since the doctor had told him the prognosis and left.  All he could do was wallow in his despair, thinking of what he had hoped to achieve on his return, all of which would no longer be possible.
“I will put out some feelers regarding the situation with Sherlock immediately but I don’t want to just send you charging in and mess up his operation unnecessarily if he is merely undercover; you know how he would take that.  Let me handle this one for now, John, until we have a better understanding of what is happening.  If you wish to be of assistance, perhaps we can follow up on this information that you have received from Sherlock’s associate.  Do I assume you have an address where we might locate Moran, if it is he?”
“I think somebody around here is a little overdressed.”
Sherlock ran his hands up and down John’s thighs, scratching lightly at the skin as he went.  He slipped his hands round the back of John’s legs and did it again, causing John to flinch when he touched behind his knees.  He did it again as it was obviously a sensitive spot.  He slid his hands back up and this time he went as high as the bottom of John’s pants and trailed along the skin at the edge of the material with his thumb.  John shuddered above him and his cock bobbed at the attention.
Moran dumped a wad of cash on the table and the croupier gave him a pile of chips.  He took a spare chair which had conveniently opened up across from John and they settled in to play.
When the actors played out this scene, Sherlock was watching closely as he sat beside John, who was busy looking over his script as his first scene was coming next.  Greg didn’t seem happy about the way it was coming across but couldn’t seem to see why, so he had them do it a few times more.  It was quite obvious to Sherlock, however, that the reason it wasn’t working was that Oliver didn’t like Jasmine.  He was trying his best to flirt with her, but it really wasn’t reaching his eyes at all and, consequently, it didn’t seem genuine.
The section John was in had a lot of phones, but they were all from the wrong era.  He laughed when he saw a huge brick-like mobile phone from the 1980’s and tried to imagine having to lug that around, unlike the tiny pocket mobiles used today.  He was lucky in that, at the very back, he found an older phone which looked like it would fit for the era they were aiming for.  He pulled it out and took it to show Sherlock.
Sherlock smiled wolfishly down at him.  “Mmm, Dr Watson, I like where your mind is going.”
“Yes, do you think you only managed the level of little girl squeals or did you make it all the way up to proper squealing piglet?  I think you made it, if you ask me; I was very impressed.”
“If it involves you doing ‘pleasant’ things to my body then yes, please.”
“How are we going on the scenery and costumes?  Do you need any help to get things finished or are both teams on schedule?”
After everything he had been through and everywhere he had been, he was finally home.
“Really, because I brought this one with me and have it wrapped up in my pocket for you right now.”
“I’m hardly worth showing off, Sherlock.”
John was feeling about as miserable as it was possible to be when trying to look happy.  He had been picked up by Mary in the limousine from the embassy and, after roundly praising her beauty, had sat in his own seat quietly looking out of the window until they had reached the party.  They had arranged to meet all their friends there but there was only one person that John could think of and he was fairly sure that he wouldn’t even be there if it could be helped.
Finally, John pulled back, cupping his hands round Sherlock’s face, thumbs brushing against those cheekbones.
“On the night of my sixteenth birthday, I knew what you were going to ask and I’d been waiting for it.  I’d seen your face over those last months and I knew how you felt about me.  I would have come to you before but I could tell your morals wouldn’t have allowed you to do anything illegal so I waited for that day.  When you eventually came to me, I was so disappointed when I saw the look on your face.  I knew something had happened but I couldn’t tell specifically what that was and, as I said before, I couldn’t ask you without giving everything away.”
“I thought a slight interruption might be better than having to deal with the death of a cast member.”
“I don’t now that you’re here.  You’re the one who makes everything seem right.”
Thank you for the photo.  You look great, very handsome, and the Keffiyeh is most fitting.  I was right, that dark shade of red does suit your colouring perfectly.  I’m sure that it will work out well for you as a disguise if you should ever need it.
"That's correct.  Best friends, in fact."  Sherlock blushed at this; John had never actually said that before.  John gave another short smile at Simon, which didn't reach his eyes, and Sherlock knew that look was trouble.  He was secretly gleeful that John was on his side and might actually stand up for him, if he was lucky.  He had no need to worry on that score, as John had very quickly ascertained what sort of people they were, even if he hadn't already had advance warning from Sherlock.
Sherlock grinned at him, even more pleased than he had anticipated that John liked it.  “Come through and see the rest properly.”
“Good morning, John.”
"Sherlock, darling, you're looking well, and you, John.  I was talking with the Headmistress when we arrived and she said the shows had been very impressive so far; are you looking forward to the performance this evening?"
They grinned at each other and returned to some serious kissing before they headed back to halls to meet up with Mike and Molly.  They were all going into the town as there was no rugby match scheduled for that afternoon.  They had decided to make the most of their time and go to the cinema.  Sherlock wasn't overly keen to see a film, not having been to the cinema, but John had told him it would be worth his while.
Sherlock rubbed his thumb over John’s lower chest, enjoying the feel of the small patch of skin which had been revealed as John had stretched his arms around Sherlock.
Sherlock nodded at Billy and John followed him as they made their way through the fairly quiet casino.  There was only one blackjack table running and a foursome playing poker at one side.  John figured they must be special customers to be here out of hours; either hardened gamblers or people with money enough to pay for the privilege.  He followed Sherlock to a discretely hidden door near the bar and they went upstairs and into one of the offices.
“Yes, but this was your father, Sherlock.  I didn’t want to put you at odds with him.”
“I don’t care what he was saying.  You’re all twice his age and you should know better.  Now, unless you want me to go and get that policeman over there, you should get out of here and never bother him again.”
John was slowly woken up about two hours later by soft kisses on his stomach.  His hand tightened in Sherlock’s hair and, when Sherlock looked up at him, he beckoned him up higher.  Sherlock crawled up his body and they lay on their sides facing each other.  John leant in for a kiss then rested his forehead on Sherlock’s and looked into his eyes.
“No, thank you.”
“I do have some tablets I can give you, though my stores are running low this close to the end of term.  I won’t get my new supply through until next term now.”
Dearest Sherlock
This was just heart-breaking.  He really had had no idea of the depth of John’s feelings, but then, maybe John hadn’t either.  It seemed they had both used this time apart to clarify and solidify their feelings for each other.  It was also true that John may not have been ready to say anything before Sherlock had left anyway and he could understand that as he, too, had been loath to rock the boat at that time.  Let’s hope they could both be brave now.
When they got up the stairs, John pulled Sherlock into his room, slamming the door shut behind them and pressing Sherlock up against it, his lips quickly finding Sherlock’s own and taking possession.  John’s hands pushed inside Sherlock’s coat and he slid them up and down Sherlock’s sides a few times, pulling his shirt out of his trousers a bit further on each pass.  When it finally came loose, John slipped his hands underneath and revelled in his first touch of that soft skin below his fingertips.  It wasn’t enough; he had a feeling it would never be enough, but he had to see that skin, feel more of it with his fingers and his lips.  He needed to taste it all, to see if it was as delicious as Sherlock’s neck.
“Which part?”
John laughed and ran to the edge and leapt as far as he could, grabbing hold of his knees and dive bombing right next to Sherlock.  When he came up, Sherlock was wiping his face from all the splash back.  They horsed about for a few minutes, splashing everywhere and trying to push each other under the water.  They set themselves up for a race down the length and back, and after Sherlock counted them in, they powered off down the pool.  Sherlock had a long, smooth stroke with his extra length helping him cut quickly through the water.  John had all the power in his body from his rugby playing, and he had been doing a lot more exercise with that than Sherlock had recently.  It was close, but he just managed to edge to victory with a last powerful kick.  He insisted that he needed a victory kiss to celebrate his win, so they indulged in that for a while, until John pushed down with his arms, which were around Sherlock’s neck, and ducked him before swimming away, laughing.
Sherlock spent the majority of the next two weeks at the hospital with John.  He encouraged him when he was feeling low and pushed him to his limits when he had his physiotherapy, determined that John should get back as much movement as possible in his arm.
“Not like you haven’t seen bodies before.  You beat them with whips, ‘member?”  This set John off again as he thought about the day he had met Sherlock.
“I suppose I’ll have to stay here for a little while if you’re going to force me.”
“Don’t seem so down, it’ll give us something to focus on next term. Plus, we break up in a couple of days and then we have Christmas to look forward to and we’ll see each other right after so that’ll be brilliant.”
“Yes, you’ve done really well with that.  You don’t have to worry about going without for anywhere near as long as I do; I am so much older and more experienced after all.  It’ll just make it easier if you’re ever kidnapped again for you to know that you can hold out, though the chances of that happening should be greatly reduced now with your extra strength.”
“A medical man?”
Sherlock shook his head to try and clear it and eventually asked another question.  John took a little longer to focus enough to answer, but he did get it right.  He trailed his finger down the centre of Sherlock’s chest, circling the belly button and then following down the thin line of hair to stop at the waistband of Sherlock’s boxers.  Sherlock nodded and John kissed in the centre of Sherlock’s chest and traced the line his finger had just made with his tongue and lips, alternating each and peppering in little kisses and bites on his way down.
Sherlock had obviously finished his mental sorting as he climbed on the bed and pushed Greg down to lie on his back.  He kissed him firmly on the lips then leaned up to look him in the face, a fiendish grin on his face.
Sherlock slid out of bed and went round to help John.  John stood still for a moment when he was up, getting his balance and gathering his breath back.  He found walking a bit easier today, though he was still stiff and his bruised body ached.  Sherlock still accompanied him across the room and that warm hand was there against his back again.
"Hush, I'm deducing," John grinned at him.  “I would have to say it is this perfectly formed, five point, crystalline star which is in pride of place here in the centre of the tree."
“As if they could be trusted where you are concerned.”
“Yes, John.”
By the time they’d finished Sherlock had filled several pages of his notebook and John was happy that he’d outlined his role and he was keen to start memorising his lines.  Sherlock left him to it at that stage and John fell asleep with his script drooping in his hand, going over lines in his head.
John blushed.  It was true that he still felt reluctant to let Sherlock out of his sight and it seemed Sherlock felt exactly the same.  There had been more and more of these types of comments between them and it was clear that John was not alone in his new-found feelings.  He wanted to take things slow though to allow them both to process what was happening and to allow Sherlock time to recover, as John’s medical side was still on high alert and determined to see his friend back to full health in all things.
“That.  Being all tempting and gorgeous.  I just can’t resist you.”
“Well, I think us swashbucklers ought to stay together, so if you aren’t bothered either way then I’ll take the pirate please.”
“Sherlock, I… I don’t know what to say.  Thank you.  I want you more than anything too.  I just feel so lucky and honoured that I am the one you’re sharing yourself with.”
“And, if it isn’t?”
Thank you for your letter.  I do find myself immeasurably looking forward to receiving every word from you.  Even though I have an eidetic memory, and know your letters by heart, I still like to re-read them; it allows me to reassure myself that someone actually feels this way about me of all people.
John and Greg had a rugby match on the Saturday afternoon which Sherlock went down to watch.  Mike and Molly came over to stand with him as they hadn’t seen much of him and John this week with all the practise they’d been doing.  Sherlock was getting better at filtering their wittering so that he could concentrate on watching John but still maintain an underlying awareness of their conversation, so that he would know when they were addressing him specifically.  The boys won their game and the foursome spent the evening in the common room watching some trashy reality chat show on TV.  It was enhanced by listening to Sherlock’s sarcastic comments and revelations about the participants which were always proved correct when the truth came out at the end of the episode.
John was trying, unsuccessfully, to pull at the buttons of his shirt but he hadn’t seemed to realise he was now wearing a hospital gown so he didn’t have much luck.
John smiled when he saw the present in Sherlock's hand; he hadn't been sure if Sherlock did gifts.  He'd brushed it aside when John had asked about his birthday.  John had gone ahead and got him something anyway.  He hadn't been able to resist when he'd seen it in the little curio shop in the local village, when he'd gone out for a walk with his grandfather the morning after they arrived.  John had ended up explaining all about his friend and his grandfather had enjoyed hearing John's enthusiasm and seeing it just light up his face as he talked.  Hamish had seen a lot of the world from being in the army and was not as small minded about such things as others of his generation might have been.  He was just glad that John was happy.
“Ahh, no teeth!”
John joined Sherlock in a soft chuckle, knowing that there was nothing Sherlock liked more than something which captured his attention in such an all-encompassing manner.  He was more than happy to provide a focus for Sherlock’s interest, in fact, he could think of nothing better than to have the force of that mighty brain pointed directly at him.
It was John’s turn to look a little embarrassed.  “Well, I… I write songs and that tune just spoke to me and I weaved it into a whole song.”
Just as he was considering dashing down to drag Moran back up again to act as a blood donor he heard Lestrade shout as he came up the stairs.  There was nothing for it, he would have to use him and then glamour him to forget it afterwards.
“Piss off.”
There was no way Sherlock was winning the challenge or getting out of this unscathed.  John was determined to drive him out of that massive brain of his, until he was just a ball of reactions and sensations.
10th April
Mummy gave Sherlock a hug.  “Thank you, darling, you were wonderful.”  Sherlock blushed, but looked pleased.  John was smiling proudly at him, and was soon engulfed in his own hug and a whispered ‘thank you’ in his ear.
“It would seem that I have little choice in the matter.  We need intel as quickly as possible and I think you are perfectly suited to be able to provide insight into Sherlock’s movements prior to his suspected capture and help to secure a possible location.”
When they got to the hospital Sherlock was asked to wait outside whilst they took John into the Casualty Unit.  He paced up and down in the corridor, his thoughts whirling as he thought over what John had said.  Did John really love him?  He had certainly noticed that John had stopped going out on those worthless dates but he had just enjoyed having John’s undivided attention without considering the wider consequences of why it had happened and what that could mean to John.  Had he stopped seeing those women because he was now interested in someone else – in Sherlock himself?
“John.  Don’t you dare die on me.”  Sherlock pulled at his hair despairingly as he heard John’s heart beat slowing.  “We haven’t had a chance to have the talk.  I don’t know what you want me to do, John.  Do you want me to bite you?  Do you want to become a vampire?  I can’t let you die, John, I just can’t.”
If you’re worried about Mycroft interfering then I can only apologise for him and I’ll try to keep him away from you as much possible.  Just ignore everything he said to you.  I can always set Mummy on him if I need to; though that might be like jumping from the frying pan into the fire as she would be so excited and want to know the ins and outs of our every move.  I would do it for you though.
“So, where are the girls?  Are we meeting them there?”
“You are a spoilsport, Dr Watson.”
“I will hold you to that, Dr Watson.”
“I was at the drama party yesterday and was doing some dancing, but nothing too wearying, and we all ate and drank the same things and there’s nothing wrong with anyone else.  Sherlock, here, was fine and he was with me the whole night.  No, I haven’t had anything wrong with my eyes, so I don’t think it’s a migraine or anything like that.”
“Good for me.  Let’s try anyway; I’ll start.  Dare.”
"I know you can but it doesn't mean you have to."  John laughed.   "This is Sherlock, by the way.  I'm sure you'll see us back here very soon - he's a big fan of your scones now, too."
“Moran?  Colonel Sebastian Moran?  Is that whom it is?  Billy didn’t actually give me a name just an address.  I know him; I met him in Afghanistan.  Seemed pleasant on first acquaintance; taught me to hone my skills with the sniper rifle, but he has absolutely no conscience.  Got drummed out of the service for picking off a group of Afghani’s just for target practise.  Seems just the sort to chum up with Moriarty.”
“Calm down, John.  Everything is fine.  Don’t move so fast like that, you’ll exacerbate your injuries.”
Miss Casewell –                         Played by Natalie Powell
They made their way back to halls and hunted up Mike.  Rather unsurprisingly, he was with Molly in the common room, but he was more than happy to detour to his room to get the skis for Sherlock.  They were exactly the sort Sherlock had hoped to get, curve-tipped wooden skis with matching poles.  Sherlock stored them in his room for now, as John insisted it was not necessary to take them back down to the drama studio right this minute.  He had rather hoped to spend his afternoon in much more pleasant pursuits in Sherlock's room, and it turned out even Sherlock could be waylaid from his current obsession with that far more enjoyable distraction.
The twice weekly rehearsals went on apace.  It wasn't long until they were practising with the scenery sets in place, so they could do proper entries and exits and really block out the whole play, as it would be on the day.  Everyone now knew their lines, even the two understudies, who had had to learn the whole play, not just individual characters, as they could be called on for any of the roles if necessary.
"Well, young man, it sounds like you have a war wound to be proud of, in that case.  Now take it easy as much as you can for the next couple of days to give it time to heal, without opening the wound again.  Come back and see me when the dressings need changing, so I can make sure it doesn't get infected or anything.  Now, are you boys ok to help him up to his room; he can rest his leg for the rest of the night and I'll bring his tea to him in his room, just this once?"
"I had exactly the same things as you and you're fine."
“Yes, you did.  The driver tried to shoot me and you deflected him but you were too dizzy to control it and he shot again and hit you twice.  John, you… you were dying, right there in my arms.  I didn’t have a choice; I couldn’t let you die so I bit you and gave you my blood.  John, you’re a vampire.”
Greg continued, as Sherlock raised his eyebrows then chuckled at John. “All that investigating - I mean, I know I didn’t do as much as you two – but it was really interesting.  I can see why you like it, Dad; maybe it would be something I’d like to do.”
Last night was amazing.  Can't wait to kiss you again.
“What’s doncom?”
“Well, that was great for a first performance back after such a long break.  Most of you remembered what we went through last term and it’s clear which parts we need to work on next, but it’s certainly good progress made so far.  Well done on learning your lines, too, though a couple of you still need to work on the second half a little more.  Overall I think we’re doing really well, though.”  He smiled at them all and there were lots of happy faces looking back at him.  He looked over to Sherlock.
“What…?”
"You were always a very careful student, John; I know I can trust you to be safe around the machines.  If you were to come in a couple of lunch times, to do the work between classes, then I'd be around if you needed any assistance.  I have lunch in my work room, but I'll leave you to get on with it yourselves."
“What makes you think something has changed?”
“Wait… what?  How did you know that?  The agency obviously knew I was a detective but they didn’t know anything about John; how did you?”
“No, it’s fine.  I wouldn’t want you to feel you couldn’t sleep in your own bed if you wanted to.”
Sally was standing by Greg and asked the question they were all wondering.  “What exactly is going on here?  What’s this all about?”
It didn’t take much for both boys to reach orgasm, and as Sherlock came hard into John’s mouth, he swallowed it all down and brought himself off to the image of Sherlock’s face, relaxed into bliss.  That was something of which he would never get tired.
“Thank you.”
Mike raised his eyebrows at John who nodded to him then, as they had already tentatively planned, John suggested they go for a stroll down to the grounds.
Sherlock watched as the man saluted a couple of officers near the door before escorting his companion over to a nearby table where they joined a large group who were already seated.  Sherlock kept him in his peripheral vision as he continued his own conversation with John, Greg and Mycroft.  After Jenkins’ table had finished their second round of drinks the group all stood up and made their way onto the dance floor.
Later in the evening Sherlock ordered takeaway from their favourite Chinese restaurant and plated a portion for John and even some for himself to please John.  John managed to eat with one hand, balancing his plate on the other hand with the splinted fingers.
30th July
“We don’t usually bite people for food, we drink from blood bags.  I’ve previously only done it for sexual pleasure and then glamoured the person afterwards so they don’t even know it’s happened.”
He reached one arm down between their bodies and circled their shafts, rubbing them together and running his thumb over both their slits on each upstroke.  Sherlock was the first to fall; all the teasing was finally too much for him and he shouted John’s name as his release shot up on to his chest.  John following soon after; loving the expression of bliss on Sherlock’s face as he lay there, only semi-conscious.
Sherlock was an excellent dancer and he had them spinning around the floor with such flair and ease that any thoughts of his injury completely slipped John’s mind and all trace of the limp disappeared. Sherlock smiled to himself that he’d been correct about his hypothesis about John’s leg, then shrugged it off and positioned them so that they were dancing next to Jenkins.  It seemed things had been moving apace with their quarry and he had already swapped partners and was now dancing with the General’s wife.
“You have clearly been on active duty as recently as three months ago.  Your hands are tanned but there is no tan above your wrists so not from sunbathing, therefore, serving in a hot country; most likely Afghanistan.  Your injury has precluded your continuing service, thus you have been honourably discharged; though I would say that the leg was not the point of impact as you are not favouring it as you stand here.”
“Oh God, yes, me too.”
“Who knows with the situations we end up in?  I have to say that learning not to use my new abilities has been just as complicated as learning to use them.  It’s taken a while to learn that I can’t hold anything too tightly; or to stop myself from just picking up a whole chair when I’m only trying to pull it out; or to move too quickly from one place to another.”
John reached the end and saw a trolley stacked with trays waiting to be cleared and emptied into the dishwasher.  He judged his timings perfectly and, at just the right moment, he kicked one of the trays in from his side and it shot out the other side, catching Jenkins on the ankle and quickly bringing him down as he tried unsuccessfully to maintain his footing.  Sherlock grabbed his ankles to make sure he couldn't get up again and John pressed his knee into his back to hold him down.  John pulled Jenkins hands together behind his back and whipped off his bandana and used it to tie them together, keeping him in place.
“Well, we shall have to wait and… oh, that sounds like his car now.”
“I’m glad that was sorted, Inspector.  Now, did you want to finish the point you were trying to make to Mollie here?”
Sherlock sighed and settled himself back down leaning on John again.  After sending off a quick text to Lestrade, he pulled John's arm over his chest and managed to get his head under John's other hand, nudging it to let John know that he wanted his hair stroked.  He had a very sensitive scalp and loved the way John ran his fingers through it.
“Can you get yourself to the border?  I have agents in Greece that I could mobilise.”
John blushed and suspicions of Sherlock’s sexual awareness were raised from ‘non-existent’ to ‘comfortable with flirtation and innuendo’.  He had never heard Sherlock say such a thing before and would have to find out if this was a previously undiscovered side of the man or something relating only to himself.
Sherlock smiled somewhat shyly, “Well, I must admit it’s nice to hear that kind of comment again.  The only other person who is usually so impressed by my observations has been unavailable to me for far too long.”
“Me neither.”
John jumped up and rushed across to Sherlock, lifting his body against the wall with one hand whilst he grabbed his cock with the other.  Sherlock gasped in surprise as John went straight in and swallowed him down, holding him in his throat.  As he'd been kissing Sherlock John had remembered how it felt to have Sherlock do this to him without needing to stop to breathe and he knew he just had to try it.
“Come now, John.  Don’t be coy.  I know that you have received your call-up papers and you are going to ask Sherlock to wait for you.  Do you really think that is fair?”
“Do it.”  John tilted his neck further allowing Sherlock perfect access.
“You’re the amazing one, John; to think so well of me.”
“I know, it’s fine.  I forgot for a moment.”  Sherlock pushed John back down again and kissed him to stop him apologising again.  He looked down as him with an evil grin on his face.  “I can see that next time I want to torment you, I’ll have to make sure you’re tied down properly.”
“It would never have been anyone else, John.  It’s only ever been you.”
It took a good six weeks for John to be completely recovered and even then he still had twinges in his fingers from where they had been so badly broken.  He did physiotherapy exercises each day to get full mobility back.  Luckily it wasn’t his trigger finger but he still didn’t want a residual weakness to slow him down.
“I know it’s just in my head, but that doesn’t make it work any better.  Why don’t you ask Greg instead?”
Why Can’t You See?
“Is this…?”
“I… Sorry.  I’m sorry, Sherlock, I don’t know what I …?”
“I never said anything.  For a start, it was none of their business and I can’t be correcting every fool who makes assumptions – it would be never ending.”
“Well, it definitely sounds like he has accepted whatever feelings he had whilst you’ve been ‘dead’, as it were.  I would say you’re certainly in with a chance as long as the shock of seeing you alive doesn’t finish him off first.”
“Oh God.  What have I let myself in for?”
“Why did you bother coming then?”
John laughed again.  “No I wouldn’t, God help me.  Anything is worth having you back again.”
Sherlock pressed play again, his fingers white as he held tightly to the sides of the laptop as he listened.  John sounded so sad and there was a hitch to his breath at the end of the message when he said Sherlock’s name; as if it was something he hadn’t done in a while.  Sherlock was stunned at the depth of emotion in John’s voice.  He’d known that John would be upset, but he hadn’t thought that he would take the blame for it – for not being able to stop it.
Message sent: May 15, 05:25 am.
“You made that quite clear.”
“Take your time with it, Greg, it took me a while to accept it, too, so I know how you feel.  There’s no rush to make a decision.  We’re both still the same people you’ve always known, you just know one thing extra about us that you didn’t before.  If you decide you’d rather go back to not knowing then Sherlock can remove that information from you and you’ll never know any different.”
“So if it hadn’t been an emergency leaving Sherlock no choice, would you have chosen this life for yourself?”
“It was, wasn’t it?  You always get me.”  John smiled at him and then sighed, “I wish Mary could be a bit more like you.”
When John felt that Sherlock had drawn back from the edge he rocked his pelvis against him, moving their lower bodies together as he aligned their cocks and rapidly started the build-up once more.  The sensation of that friction rubbing against his shaft soon had Sherlock moaning again.  John made sure to push his whole length along Sherlock’s, brushing just under the head where he knew Sherlock was especially sensitive.
“Well enough of that, I’m sure you’d rather get on with the partying.  I managed to wangle some goodies out of Mrs Price so we have a veritable feast to enjoy.  Sally has organised some music for us, which I have promised Sherlock won’t consist of those – to quote himself – ‘infernally annoying Christmas songs that are droning on everywhere you go’.  Well, it won’t all consist of that, though there may be one or two thrown in for good measure.”
"Well, if you're sure you don't mind, then yes, I'd be happy for John to come over after Easter, for as long as you want him."
Well, Sherlock could oblige with that.  He didn’t need John anyway.  He didn’t need anyone.  He would just go about his days on his own, untroubled by the idiots surrounding him.  There were only three months left of school and he would get through it as quickly as possible and then leave this dead end place and be off to do his own thing.  He would forget the plans that he and John had long ago made of going to the same University in the centre of London; John studying medicine whilst Sherlock studied chemistry and forensics.  He had no need of sharing a place with him.  He would strike out all by himself.  He would do it all on his own.
Sherlock sat up and held on to John’s hands, using that as a balance as he lifted himself almost completely off John and slid back down again, faster this time.  He looked into John’s eyes, already seeing the lust building as John watched him back, eyes never deviating from Sherlock’s own.  They carried on like that for some time; Sherlock raising himself up slowly before ramming back down, causing moans and puffs of air to leave John’s throat each time.
“Desires - I like the sound of that.  Life-threatening, however, sounds a little melodramatic.”
“I dislike that analogy, John; you make me sound like a horse chomping at the bit.”
“Sorry, I’m sorry.  That just felt amazing, I couldn’t help myself.”  John blushed a bright red but Sherlock just laughed.
The best texts they had exchanged though had been the ones late at night when they had been missing each other badly.  The shared desires of what they would do when they were together again, had transmuted into torrid sexting sessions; where they had got each other off by daring the other to further acts, that would be repeated when they met.  John had never been gladder that his grandfather had had some boards put up in the attic a couple of years ago.  It provided the smallest space for a bed of his own, but it meant he didn’t have to share a room with Harry, as they had done when they were younger.  His life wouldn’t have been worth living if she had found out about what they were doing.
He pushed John up the bed so that he could rest against the headboard and see what Sherlock was doing to him.  He unfastened John’s trousers and slid them down; enjoying the fact that John hadn’t put any pants on in his rush to leave earlier so his cock sprang free, already hard with a bead of pre-come waiting to be tasted.  Sherlock leant forward and licked the slit, gathering the droplet and making a great show of swirling his tongue round his mouth to get the full flavour.  John couldn’t tear his face away from the sight of Sherlock between his legs and in the next moment he let out a mighty shout as Sherlock bent over and deep throated him in one go, proving his lack of gag reflex as well as not needing to breathe.
“I’ve been keeping myself busy.  How about yourself?”
"I think John's right.  There is no need to cancel at this stage.  He and I will monitor the situation, as I know you have enough to do, putting on the final touches before the show."
“Merely concern?” Sherlock queried, shyly.
“What, um… what are you going to do when you want to sleep?”
Hopefully speak to you soon.
John pushed Sherlock up and swatted him on the arse as he got up behind him.
Sherlock was in fine mood on the way back and even offered to carry Mrs Hudson’s shopping and held his elbow out for her to link her arm through as they walked home.  He enjoyed his specially decorated cake after tea and grinned when he put Mycroft’s in front of him.  Mycroft merely rolled his eyes and proceeded to eat it anyway – it was a cake, after all.
“Do you remember being at the raid to rescue those girls and then you and I jumped in the van to catch the guy who tried to get away?”
“You’re welcome, I guess.”  Greg smiled tentatively at John.  “So maybe you should tell me about vampires.”
“I think I would probably refrain for a few days, if I were you.”
Monday evening was rugby practise so they didn’t have chance to explore the prop store until Tuesday evening.  Mike and Molly joined them and the four of them went to see what they could scavenge for their show.  They had borrowed a trolley from the caretaker’s storage area which they could fill and wheel over to the drama studios.  Their group had been assigned one of the rehearsal rooms to keep everything in as the main room was used for school drama lessons during the daytime.
“Are you sure; those could just as easily be talon marks?”  John laughed as he said it, finally giving up on his teasing.  Sherlock looked at the amusement on John’s face and smirked back at him.
He didn’t know what to reply.  His brain had been swirling all day with thoughts of ‘not gay’ and ‘that was amazing’ and ‘how could I?’  Feelings of elation at how wonderful it had felt whilst he’d dreamt (as he thought) the blow job, and then worried about somehow having cheated on Mary.  He did try to reason with himself that it had been subconscious so he couldn’t really help it.   He told himself that he hadn’t realised it wasn’t Mary in his dream to start with but when he remembered running his fingers through what were clearly Sherlock’s curls and not wanting to stop, he brought himself round full circle and started through the confusing thoughts all over again.
“Of course.”  Greg went around to the front and pulled the driver out of the car, taking some handcuffs off another approaching officer and letting them carry him away.  He came back round to the rear of the van in time to see John being lifted into the ambulance on a trolley.  One of the paramedics was continuing the CPR and Sherlock had taken over squeezing an air bag attached to a mask covering a lot of John’s face.  Just before they closed the door, Greg leaned in to question them.
He went along to his bedroom and was happy to see that his microscope and all his chemistry supplies were stacked in boxes in the corner so at least he wouldn’t need to replace anything.  That was good.  He opened the wardrobe door and slid his hand down his favourite purple shirt.  Everything was just how he had left it – all his clothes ready and waiting for him.  Well, except for the fact that this shirt was at the front instead of in its usual place between the navy and black shirts.  This one had been removed more recently and had lost the crisp edges usually in place when it was returned from the dry cleaners.  In fact, looking at the stretching on the buttonholes, it almost looked as if it had been worn.  Had it?  Would John have…?  He took it out and sniffed the inside of the collar.  John’s aftershave.  He had.  He had worn Sherlock’s shirt.  Sherlock immediately stripped off the new shirt he was wearing and put this one on instead.  It felt softer and warmer and he could smell John.  He smiled to himself and hung the other shirt back in the wardrobe in the appropriate place.
Sherlock kept going and John let him; deciding that the view of Sherlock’s arse was well worth staying right where he was.  He stretched his arm down and pinched one of those luscious cheeks.  Sherlock squeaked in surprise and almost dropped him on the spot.  John laughed as Sherlock righted him as they reached the car and opened the door.  They both got in and John smiled as he saw Mycroft give him a small nod in the rear view mirror as they headed home.  Much as Sherlock liked to deny it, John knew that Mycroft cared about him and he knew that Mycroft would be pleased to see Sherlock smiling again, even though he was trying to hide it in front of Mycroft.
“Thank you, Sherlock.  I mean it; you’ve been amazing today.  Thanks.”
John stared for a moment and then shook his head.  “You have to stop doing that.”
When the whole cast and crew had arrived on Wednesday, and had finished doing their usual warm up, Sherlock carried over the radio which was hidden under a cloth.  When everyone was looking, John pulled the cloth aside and shouted ‘Ta da!’
John smiled at the look of hopeful doubt on Sherlock’s face.  He moved his arm up out of Sherlock’s way and Sherlock smiled happily and swung his legs up on to the sofa and carefully laid his head down into John’s lap.  Sherlock sighed and settled himself comfortably into position and they continued watching the film.
John grinned at Sherlock and pulled him in close.  "You're definitely good for a guy's ego.  Let's hope Greg feels the same way.  Now I think I deserve a kiss for services rendered."
“I’m sorry,” John grinned, “you do like to tell me how unobservant I am.”
Mrs Hudson took the second tray of cakes out of the oven and put them on the rack to cool whilst Sherlock moved the cakes he had decorated out of the way so they could start on the jam tarts.  Mrs Hudson got down two mixing bowls and let Sherlock measure out the ingredients for both bowls and she showed him how to rub the butter into the flour to make the pastry.  They put it in to the fridge to chill for a short while and Sherlock decorated the second tray of cakes in a more traditional fashion this time.
