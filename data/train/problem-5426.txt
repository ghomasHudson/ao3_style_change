“Enough of that, who do you think the father of the twins is?” Cammy asks, “I mean, if I had to guess, Harley Stark-Odinson looks a lot like Thor…”
Peters heads to sit down next to him and lays his head on the omega's lap, "Mama, how are you feeling now?"
“I can’t allow you in their lives if you intend to leave,” Tony firmly states, “Even if we don’t work out, the boys should never feel abandoned by you, ever.” The fierceness in Tony eyes told Thor that nothing less would be acceptable and that was what made Thor kiss him, he held his face close as Tony placed his hands on his shoulders. The scent of rain and mint, the electricity and heat between them take Tony out of reality. This is what he had been missing out on, the drunken fling didn’t do this action justice. It was like he had a drink of heaven and could not fully appreciate it when it was there, now that it had been gone so long, it tastes even better than he imagined.
“They are the most perfect things I have ever seen,” Thor longingly looks at the door, “I have only imagine how they were as children,”
“Harley, Peter, how about we give the adults some space? Loki, what else can we do to pass the time?” Rhodey gives Loki a look to hurry him up.
After retiring to be a coach, he thought that it would be enough. But being near his omega again showed him that it never would.
“It was late December, two years ago, where Steve found me in Seattle, living in a shelter. I had lost everything, I was wondering the streets having to beg for food on the daily. It was one hell of an experience. I was eating my soup one night before Christmas, and there was Steve walking through the door,” James pauses and sniffles while caressing his child, “He insisted I come live with him in New York, we were raised in the same neighbourhood, we did everything for each other,” James wipes off the tears in his eyes, “He got us an apartment here, and said that he was helping raise your kids with you and that he wasn’t ready to leave the boys, I have to say that I am surprised he wasn’t in a relationship, you seemed so close.”
Its been like a while, but it was Christmas and I was lazy with no WiFi. I also wasn't sure how I wanted this to happen but eh. Please enjoy and Happy Holidays.
"-But I have to," Tony cuts in, "He helped raise our children for years, was their father for years, and I find out that he had been cheating on me for so long," He says,
Steve eventually found out about him cheating and could not look him in the eyes. Even started booking a hotel near Bucky to avoid Tony for a while.
Stark Tower is a main attraction to the people who are not from New York. The building seemed tall enough to reach the heavens. Levels upon levels of pure architectural genius and ingenuity beyond compare. The proud Stark label glistening in the first beams of sunlight. Many argue that it was one Tony Stark’s way to be a part of the New York’s skyline and others say he is compensating for what he may be lacking on. Though, no matter the reason, the tower is here to stay.
The silence in the room was deafening. Tony had imagined in hundreds of ways how this would happen and how he would feel. Now looking in those blue eyes again, he could not help but be disappointed they were blue eyes with specks of green. They were not accompanied with the smell of rain and mint. This detachment from a man he invested his time and resources to surprised Tony. He thought he would be more upset, at this point he just wanted Steve to leave.
“The situation sucks, but look,” Tony pointed to Steve, Harley and Peter talking at a park bench, “They are getting closure from this mess,”
“Tony, I need you to know that I want whatever you’re willing to give me, all I ask is to have the chance to get to know them,” Thor pleads,
They arrived around 4:30 PM. May was working, so she helped them sign in and said that she remembered Steve from the phone. She told Peter, “There’s some other kids your age, dear. You’ll do just fine here.”
Bucky shrugged and winked at him. Harley turned to Peter and whispered (very loudly, actually), “Is that your dad’s sugar daddy?” The once laughing Peter morphed into an all out cracking up teenager, as he guffawed and cackled at the question.
They’re a power couple, Tony decides after scrolling through Natasha’s feed. She’s only made four posts with Virginia, two of them having more than one photo attached, but Virginia’s made seven. He looks at all of them, which are all vastly similar in that there’s more often than not a cute picture of their arms wrapped around each other or lips pressed against each other, likely taken by a friendly and thankfully not homophobic passerby, with a cheesy caption (Virginia) or a string of vaguely related emojis (Natasha).
“No!” Tony clears his throat, startled by his own sudden loudness. Adonis, god of beauty and desire, seems unbothered. “Sorry. No. It’s fine. Don’t apologize. Um, I’m Tony.” He sticks out a hand.
time stops in this moment. There’s an air of flirtation between them, sure, but what if Tony’s reading everything wrong? What if Steve is just making friendly conversation, and truly wants nothing more than to turn and run from Tony’s shaky hands and cold brew and lame attempts at humor? For a second -- a full
And this was their fourth home, fifth if you counted Bucky’s (which you probably should, for all the times that Steve and Peter stayed there). They were being evicted once more, because Peter needed braces and glasses, and the district was making a lot of cuts so the art teachers had to buy their own supplies at the start of the school year, and Steve indulged himself a little too much and bought himself new pens. There was a lot of reasons Steve couldn’t afford rent this month. There was a lot of reasons he couldn’t afford it during other months too. Their landlord had never been very merciful at all.
“Call him Jim,” Bucky adds, a little smirk on his face like he’s spilling secrets or inside jokes with people who could never understand. “We had a little spat about who could be called James. I won.”
They hugged each other too, bidding each other goodbye with a promise to get dinner sometime the following week lolling off their tongues. Peter waved to Bucky through the window when Steve drove away, and Bucky waved back, his metal arm stuffed nervously into the front pocket of his jeans. He was always afraid whenever they leave for a shelter, like how Steve was whenever he heard on the radio there was an active shooter situation or a high speed chase or an armed robbery, because even without hearing Bucky’s badge number, he always felt sure Bucky was there, doing his job, like he always did; they were both afraid that one day, one of them wouldn’t come home.
“Hi,” he responded, less confidently than he had been with Peter only moments before, but Steve had expected that. “I’m Harley Keener, sir.”
“Huh,” Steve says, all slow like he’s embarrassed he hadn’t known before. “I - What do you do, exactly? Like, what’s your-” Steve waves his hand around, at a loss for words- “thing?”
They always did, though. Steve never let anything happen to Peter, and Bucky’s partner was a crazy badass woman, Natasha, who would die before letting Bucky get hurt, if only for her own pride. They always came home. Steve thought they always would.
Peter blinksed “Okay,” he said slowly. He nodded, and then added, “They - um - they have good juice. I’m gonna get some. Do you want any?”
. Six months, and he’s here. With a Pink Drink and a cold brew and Snapchat and dog tags that aren’t even his. (Well, they’re maybe a little bit his.)
He sniffled, and smacked Bucky on the back with everything he could, hoping it conveyed everything he couldn’t find the strength to say out loud. “I’ve got you, too,” he responded. Bucky pulled away and smiles.
of donut, but more than that, Peter was starving and if there was one thing he wanted for his last meal, it was that.
as a parent and father and caregiver, Peter had remained as bubbly as ever. For the first two apartments, he was too young to understand why they were leaving, especially the second one, but Steve sat him down and explained the dangers of being poor tenants in Queens and Brooklyn when Peter was 10 and they were planning to leave the third apartment.
Peter giggled, and his smile doubled in size when the boy standing behind him popped his head out and poked Peter’s side. “So much trouble,” the boy responded, and Steve smiled at him.
“I’m trying here, I’m trying to make peace with you and you are choosing to be difficult,” Steve shouted,
“Tones, have you seen the news?” Rhodey strides straight towards Tony, “I need you to promise you will not be impulsive this time,”
“I am so sorry, I was distracted trying to catch up with my kids,” Tony breathes out distracted by this man,
“I could not find the nurse but I brought my brother, he knows of some methods to-“, The man stops when notices that Tony is now awake. He strides in slowly and nervously. Tony gets up to meet him halfway,
Steve let out a watery laugh, and Tony wondered why was he surprised, “Part of me still thinks of them as mine,” Steve said softly, “and you left them regardless,” Tony responded, “Did you think they would be here waiting to call you alpha,”
As he enters the apartment complex, he uses the power of money to grant him access. It concerns him how easy it is to enter. He reaches the elevator and he can feel himself becoming angrier. After all they went through, with raising their children, the sneaking out to have dinner so the press would not know about them, paying off restaurants to not utter a word of their adventures. The late nights crying over the people they had lost, their fears and wondering what the future held for them.
“Thor, these two are children that you should know about as they were born seventeen years and four months ago, nine months after that night we met,” Tony pauses,
Their little family trip involved the twins, Tony and Rhodey all of whom had a place where they wanted to visit. Peter wanted to visit the Exploratorium in San Francisco, Harley wanted to visit the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory in California and Tony wanted to see the biggest ball of twine in Minnesota.
Rhodey is not sure what to make of the situation. It has been three days since the road trip and Thor and Loki are currently in the Tower. Loki is making coffee and Thor is sparing with Harley in the wreck-room.  Peter and Tony are watching them as they discuss a few business dealings that Peter is going to have to face soon. It appears as if this has been happening for years.
James smiles lovingly, as if remembering a wonderful memory whereas Tony sits there stewing in his perpetual anger that he hopes James has not picked up on,
Tony looks around to see that the twins are staring at him concerned and Thor is bringing him some poptarts from the fridge, Tony give him a look, “They are comfort food, don’t judge me,” Thor deadpans. Tony takes one and waits on Rhodey.
Thor closes the door and takes a seat joining Tony on the couch facing the fireplace, and takes the picture from his hands slowly, “This is my favorite picture of you, carefree and happy,”
On his drive back, Tony is unsure how to feel. On one hand, he received half of the answers he wants, but he only ended up having more questions. He had not been hurt like this before. He started thinking about the questions he’ll have to answer for leaving home like that. He remembers the hurt in Thor’s eyes, and all the leftover anger turns to shame. He has something special that could be more and he still fell right back to his destructive methods, he needs to make it up to him. He needs to get better, if not just for Thor, but for himself.
“Tony, it was that bad, you were being abused in your own home,” Rhodey says walking over to the kettle,
“No Thor, I can’t have only one night with you, it’d kill me,” Thor is pushed back into reality, the haze has faded from his eyes and he looks down at the omega and his eyes are fiery and cold. Thor found himself feeling possessive and deeply attached to this burning protective side of Tony.
Afterwards he tried to do it all, he helped out with Clint's children, attending their plays and sport events while being head of Research and Development simultaneously. He helped Peter with his physics and Harley with his obsession with weaponry. He outfitted the family with technology that would not be available for decades for the sake of their safety. He played the traditional omega part and did more, but it never seemed to be enough for Steve.
Tony goes to take a seat on the couch and Steve sits on the lounge chair furthest away from him and lets out a sigh.
Tony makes it up to Thor’s apartment, nearly ten minutes away. He knocks on the door and Harley opens it up for him.
Ever since Peter and Harley were born, the tabloids were filled with possible alpha fathers in his circle. Many had thought that he was holding out the name for the drama and suspense. Whereas he had been wasted beyond belief after a particularly nasty betrayal by one Obadiah Stane. He flirted and mingled with many who were more than ready to jump at the opportunity to have him as a contact. Other than one seemingly young alpha male, blonde, toned and lean, Tony was more than interested. One thing led to another, and next thing was that he was pregnant, and he had not the means to contact the alpha, and not for the lack of trying. He recalled him being called, “Thomas” and that he was overly dramatic with his words.
The relationship was meant to stay secret, Steve was not prepared to face the backlash of his coming out. Or rather being associated with Tony Stark, playboy, billionaire, philanthropist, 43 years old omega. Steve always tried to reassure him that it was not his age, that he did not plan on having children anymore and that Peter and Harley was more than enough for him. Tony believed him. He hoped that this would make the alpha that he allows himself to be marked by and become the omega homemaker that everyone seems to think he cannot be. The sheer number of rumours that circulated the net would never reach popularity status, due to JARVIS, the family AI.
“Yes, Master Rhodes. There was a story that broke about Steve Rogers and James Buchanan Barnes are in a relationship and the latter has given birth to a girl,” JARVIS replies neutrally contrary to Rhodey who has become outraged,
Tony objectively know Steve cared for the boys, though he craved to have his own. Tony didn’t blame him as he knew that Steve would eventually want that life that Tony could not give him. Yet the watering of his eyes made Tony take a pause. Peter stormed off to cool down or most likely find his phone.
It had been months since they had seen Steve, and now Tony knows why, and it burns at him. He had believed that he had moved on; that the budding relationship meant his heart had moved on, the whole road trip was to clear his mind and heart and bond with his family, he made friends and more. It was supposed to be his fresh start. How dare Steve take this from him.
As Tony mulls over the logic of his pup, Thor asks him who is at the door. He pauses when he realizes it is Tony. He smiles slightly and invites him in. He sees about five kids in the spacious living room playing soccer on the gaming station and greets them all. Thor then leads him to his study where Tony notices a couple of pictures they had taken. One stood out, which was the one he took when they saw the big ball of yarn. The smile on that Tony’s face was beaming and Tony wanted to feel like that again.
The silence in the room was beginning to choke Tony. Why weren’t they saying anything? Are they angry at him for not working hard enough to keep Steve in their family? Maybe he should have given more money to the school fundraisers, or rather stay committed. He has never believed in soulmates, that a night with their father would damage future relationships.
they served, Steve’s girlfriend when she was pregnant, Steve’s son when his dad was job hunting. He was always the guy Steve could turn to, whenever he needed to. Steve wondered if he’d even been good enough - would ever be good enough - to be that guy for Bucky too.
“Yeah?” Peter asked, because he didn’t really know where Harley was going with this. Maybe he should have though, he realized, but didn’t bother trying to figure it out when he knew Harley would just explain anything.
Peter clambered into the car and starts the engine. Steve watches for half a second while Peter plugged Steve’s phone into the aux cord and started up his favorite playlist. Bucky pulled Steve’s vision away, though, when he put a hand on Steve’s shoulder.
“Tony, I’ve got your Pink Drink,” calls Daisy, before Tony can find another app to distract himself with. He pockets his phone again, slinking up to the countertop once more as quickly and casually as he can. He’ll mull over the Virginia/Natasha thing a different time.
Peter stepped away to get apple juice for himself and the boy, who he was slowly realizing looked a little bit older than Peter - not much, though, probably only a year or two. When he turned back to face where he once stood, he saw that the boy hasn’t moved a muscle and is, in fact, waiting while he watched Peter intently. Peter smiled nervously and stepped up to him.
They talked for a while. Peter learned that Harley was smart, maybe even smarter than anyone Peter had ever met before. Harley said he liked to build stuff, and Peter said he liked to blow stuff up. Harley laughed at all of Peter’s jokes, picked at his food when Peter asked about his parents, smiled in thanks when Peter changed the subject and asked about his robots instead; he talked really fast when they were on the topic of science, apparently hated math but loved engineering (which Peter was pretty sure had more to do with math than science, technically), and he waved his arms around passionately when Peter asked him about the best robot he’d ever built. (It was a robot named Ab-E, like his little sister, who he refused to mention beyond

Instead, he said, “Not long.” It was easier to lie like that, it came to him like it was a part of him, rolled off his tongue like it’s always fit there so perfectly, like it was meant to tumble out and explode in front of their eyes like a star. “If it’s okay, I can pack up all our crap, leave the less important stuff in the garage and take the rest with us to a shelter. Probably two weeks here is all we need.”
reruns playing softly in the background, the T.V. a source of dim light in the darkness of the night, their Chinese food cold in their lap and chopsticks mostly abandoned in their hands, Bucky asked the question he asked every time Steve’s here: “How long do you want to stay?”
“Nice to meet you, Harley,” Steve said, voice soft and light despite the pitter-patter in his heart that was just barely slowing down.
the world is a big scary place, but it's even scarier when you're at risk of being murdered with no justice for the color of your skin. now is not the time to stay silent. if you are not Black, you are obligated to stand up for the Black community. your whiteness could save somebody's life.
. Really, Tony wants to talk to Steve again, even if it’s only just on the wrong side of flirty and polite.
“Steve,” Bucky sighed, and set down his take out on the coffee table. “You know you’re good to stay as long as you want. Forever, if you need it.”
Peter tipped his head forward into the pressure against his curls. Steve thought to himself briefly that if kids could purr, Peter certainly would be doing so; Steve ran his hand through Peter’s hair, a fluid, back and forth motion that probably would have put Peter to sleep if it weren’t 2:00 in the afternoon.
Virginia and Natasha are in Cabo, on some resort-beach thing. Tony can’t help but wonder if he would’ve taken her himself, if given the chance. He probably would have. They might have drank mimosas together every morning, slept in until the sun shone in through the rafters, swam in the ocean long past sunset.
He’s 20 minutes early. Tony can count on one hand the number of times he’s been early to anything, so his arrival time actually says a lot about how important this is. And, well, what the hell is a guy who’s 20 minutes early supposed to do except pull out Instagram and stalk his ex’s new girlfriend’s profile in a very polite, totally-moved-on kind of way?
Bucky beamed, though, because for Bucky and Steve and even Sam, too, Peter was the best thing that God ever created. They all looked at Peter like he hung the stars, and he was completely unaware of it.
glasses, not only this year but every year after and probably before, too, so that he could actually see things further than three feet ahead of him. And Steve
“Peter,” Steve chuckled. “I won’t bother you about it. For now. But it’s cute. But you’re too young. But it’s still cute.”
Peter smiled, and warmth spread over his spine in the same way a blush would. He set the tray down in front of him, looking up into the dark blue eyes that peered down at him. He didn’t look away when he sat down, or when Harley sat down, or even when he said, “You too.”
It only took a few more days for him to go through all of Peter’s things. Peter had probably twice as much stuff, but Steve let him keep twice as much as he let himself keep (because Peter was a kid and
Wade was going to high school in the fall. He could stay at Midtown, if he wanted to, but Wade always talked about how much he wanted to leave. What if Wade didn’t come back next year?

is his proudest heirloom, it’s the best thing he has, the most top-drawer, cream of the crop shit he’s ever done. Was it, at some point, very awful? Sure. Was that Tony’s fault? Probably. But does it do good -- even great -- things now, because of Tony? Fuck yeah it does, and really, to Tony, that’s what matters most. Maybe once upon a time Tony would have been embarrassed to slap his name on the company that sold weapons to terrorists, but now, he’s doing everything in his power to reserve that shitshow, so yeah -- he’s proud. SI is his baby, and maybe AI is Steve’s, and maybe that’s a sign.
“Your tags,” the man explains, nodding his head and looking down at Tony’s neck, where Rhodey’s tags still hang.
They could have a couch; big and long, that spread across the expanse of the living room and maybe curved like an L, that didn't have any gross, unidentifiable stains, that wasn’t from some used furniture garage sale because it was all they could afford. Steve could paint Peter’s room like the galaxy, like he’d always wanted to, and Peter could have a little set up for experiments or projects in the garage. They could eat blueberry pancakes every Saturday morning, have Bucky and Sam over for dinner every Friday evening, watch the Sunday cartoons together or sleep in until noon. It could be good.
Tony laughs again, and because the fire in Steve’s eyes is infectious, he agrees passionately. “I mean, my bodily composition is about 65% percent coffee, but. Yeah. Milky fruit water. Literal crime against humanity.” Steve smiles again, and Tony jerks his head to the empty seat beside him on the bench. “If you’re not busy, you can - um - sit.”
“‘Kay,” he mumbled, cheeks still pink. Steve smiled sadly at him, and waited as his heart cracked inside of his chest.
“Oh,” Tony says dumbly. “They’re my best friend’s. He gave them to me. It was very emotional. Like a scene from a Brom Com.”
Steve sighed and dropped down to kneel in front of Peter, who was sat at the edge of his bed, tying his shoes. “Peter,” he said, voice firm but warm, too, “I miss you like crazy,” he admitted. Peter smiled a little bashfully - if not fully embarrassed - and kicked at Steve’s foot with his own.
“Wait,” Peter said, now even more confused than before. “You look hungry, and I already have some food. Don’t worry about it.”
She paused, and shook her head. “No,” she responded with furrowed brows. “But,” she added, “I know he’s been hanging with the Keener boy today. How about I have Clint take you to Harley and you can ask him?”
A week later, Steve had finished reorganizing all of his own things. His art supplies were stuffed into two small, cardboard boxes, taped shut and tucked away in the corner of Bucky’s garage. All of his winter clothes - coats, sweaters, socks, and more - were boxed up next to the art stuff, and Peter’s were on top. He basically packed up everything that wasn’t absolutely necessary for teaching (and his sketchbook, along with the corresponding pencils, because he, selfishly, couldn’t imagine going a day without it) and stuffed it all into the garage, taking up as little space as possible.
“Anyway,” Peter cut in suddenly, before Steve could push the conversation any further. “Maybe we should finish scheming another time? We could hang out tomorrow, if you want.”
coconut milk and fruit. Why order perfectly good coffee at a very famous coffee shop when I could get sixteen ounces of pure fucking sugar?” Tony smirks. Daisy snorts, graciously unoffended by Tony’s antics, and leans back to look at the drinks being made out of Tony’s line of sight.
He nodded, and pressed a kiss to Bucky’s cheek. “Later, Serg!” Bucky threw a peace sign up, still not looking at Peter directly, and the twelve year old scampered off to Steve’s car, pulling the keys out of Steve’s hand as he ran by.
apartment in the world; Steve wouldn’t tell Peter this, but it was also more than just a little bit because the superintendent was actively super creepy to a lot of the adolescents who lived there, and Steve could no longer put up with that shit, especially with the impending fear that Peter would be next.
Tony pulls away when Rhodey starts to laugh at him wetly and push him off. On his way out, though, he presses a jumbled kiss to Rhodey’s cheek, as per tradition. “Missed you,” he admits, quiet enough so only Rhodey can hear him. Beside them, Steve and Bucky pull apart, and Bucky throws a hand to push at Steve’s head, ruffling his hair consequently. Steve just chuckles, but it’s so deep that it reverberates through Tony’s chest even from three feet away.
- which was, by the way, completely understandable, and Peter fully related - so all the (good) food was usually gone by 7:30. There was no way in hell Peter was going to eat oatmeal for breakfast, so he dragged himself out of their little closet sized room and down the hallway, to the dining area. He strolled up to the end of the line, which curved around half the room, and grabbed a tray as he passes by.
Peter pulled his bottom lip beneath his two front teeth. He chewed on it for a moment, and Steve would scold him for it if he wasn’t already feeling
Peter shrugged, pulling his legs up to his chest and wrapping his arms around his chins. “Sounds good,” he answered. “Maybe then I’d actually learn something I didn’t already know.”
Rhodey scoffs, but it’s light and friendly and even kind of fond, too. Like it’s a good memory, even if it’s wrapped up in torn up tissue paper and bloodied gauze. “Fuck off, Buchanan.”
. The first apartment was lost to a huge fire that took every other apartment on that floor, and on the floors two above and two below. The second was an eviction, because Steve wasn’t exactly making bank as a veteran and high school art teacher; he was late to pay their crazy overpriced rent one time too many, and came home from work one afternoon to find an eviction notice pasted to his door and no more than 45 minutes to collect all of his and Peter’s belongings.
She says something to her coworkers that Tony can’t quite catch -- though he does happen to overhear some things like
-- Tony has always been the kind of guy who’s amazing at making a fool out of himself. Surprisingly, though, Steve doesn’t seem uncomfortable or weirded out by Tony’s very poor attempts at flirting; in fact, he breaks out into a grin and laughs again and it sounds like wind chimes and violins and drums and -- wait, no, that last part is just Tony’s heart fucking
“Always, Steve,” Bucky said. “Well, as long as you keep making dinner whenever you’re here.” Steve unfurled himself from Bucky’s arms, and Bucky put a firm hand on Steve’s shoulder. He stepped back, threw some distance between him and his best friend in a futile attempt to make the air feel less heavy around him. Bucky didn’t seem to notice, and said, “Anyway, I’ve got beer and Chinese take out with your name on it.”
He clicks off of Instagram. When he checks the time, it’s only been almost 10 minutes, so he’s not even halfway there. He wants to press fast forward on the whole thing so he can just get it all over with and watch

made him the proudest dad alive. He only ever did homework because it counted to his grade, but it never really helped him learn anything, because he’d always been smarter than the other kids his age. Steve worried about him, sometimes; worried that Peter would start feeling all empty and bored, with the lack of actual work he had to put in for school. He was attending a STEM school, Midtown School of Science and Technology, but still in the top of his class without even trying.
“Well, well, well,” he quipped, arms still holding Peter, prosthetic cold against the kid’s neck, as he walked their two bodies towards Steve. “If it isn’t my two favorite couch hoppers.”
It was just a dream. It took everything in Steve to wake up, to not stay in dreamland until that world became his reality.
“OJ was found not guilty, so for legal reasons, that joke is in poor taste,” Peter remarked, as if his mouth was working on autopilot. He blushed when the words catch up to him, but bit down the apology that bubbled up. “But, um, yeah. Apple juice.”
Peter wrapped his arms tighter around Steve’s waist and pushed his forehead further into his father’s sternum. “You’re not doing
He glared at wade as he turned around. “Wade,” he scolded half heartedly. “Warn a guy next time, okay?” Wade only giggled and sat down next to him -

He wishes he could say he didn’t sit by the phone, waiting for a reply, but Tony is not a damn liar.
He drove himself and Peter through the clogged 5:00 traffic, laughing as Peter called out letters on street signs in a weak attempt to play
Ned whined and flopped his head down, hiding his face in his hands that were tucked into his sweatshirt sleeves. “It’s mashed potatoes,” Ned answered dejectedly. “I thought it would be like, you know, healthier than the pizza they were serving, but-” he sighed. “I guess not.”
, so he bites his tongue, moves to lean against the wall beside the counter, and pulls his phone out of his back pocket while taking a long and slow sip of his cold brew.
The kid looked even skinnier than Peter, which was a feat in itself. He was tanner, though, and the smirk on his lips made Peter’s belly twist and curl in the way that it did when Liz Allen told Peter he was
Even though those thoughts were swirling through his head, he didn’t voice as much; still, he did say, “I can’t really stop working, Petey.”
Steve spun on his heels, and Peter followed, curling himself into Steve’s side while his father wrapped an arm over his shoulder. “I dare you to call him James to his face,” Steve said with a wink.
Steve blushes a little bit more. “Some people think it’s weird. I came back from fighting terrorists to teach kids how to draw fruit. But I like it.
. Peter swallowed, and dropped his hand in defeat. “Sorry,” he offered weakly. “You can have it.” The smirk - which, now that Peter thinks about it, was probably less of a conscious thing and more like the natural state of his face - dropped from the boy’s lips and he furrowed his brow instead.
“Have a good day, gremlin,” Bucky told him, and Peter’s cheeks might have just ripped apart with how widely he beamed. “Good luck with those tests, okay?”

“You don’t have to take care of me anymore,” Steve answered quietly. “I’m not that sick kid I used to be. I’m a captain, now.”
Steve never thought he’d be a bad dad, a bad provider, even when Mary spoke to him on her deathbed and begged him to do right by Peter.
Steve sits next to Tony, close enough that Tony can smell his cologne -- warm, spicy, something a little bit like cinnamon, which is adorable and refreshing in the late October chill -- and feel his leg brush up against Tony’s. “Um,” Steve starts, a little uncertain, like he’s nervous. Tony nods at him, urging him to continue. “I’m actually picking Bucky up from deployment too. He’s been gone for eight months. Where was your friend stationed?”

“What if…” He stepped towards Peter, his free hand coming up to grasp the other side of the donut and pull it in half. “We share?”
Tony smiles. Steve’s eyes -- bright blue and sparkling in a way that leaves Tony breathless -- crinkle at the sides when he returns the grin. “My best friend, too,” he explains. “He’s been deployed for six months. I brought him a coconut milk, strawberry concoction because he’s disgusting and drinks this shit all the time.” He lifts the Pink Drink cup and shakes it, prompting Steve to wrinkle his nose.
“Ned,” Peter said as soon as his friend sat down across the table with a lunch tray. “What the hell is that? What are you eating? That’s-” Peter choked on a laugh. “That’s disgusting.”
Tony smiles at her and nods thankfully. “Perfect,” he says. Maybe if it weren’t so crowded, he would have been a little bit friendlier, asked about her day or life or favorite caffienated beverage -
“I got you, Stevie,” he said, and it’s light but it’s full of something Steve didn’t understand, too.
Peter nodded furiously. “Yes!” he promised, laughing and shoving the plate further towards Ned. Michelle, without looking up from her book, leaned away from Ned to protect herself from the potato slime as Ned slid it away from him. “Cross my heart and hope to die.”
, and it’s sweet, cheesy, disgusting, very Brom Com-y, but Tony’s still just happy anything is happening at all. Rhodey’s home.
“Yeah,” Harley confirmed. “Next time he’s here, ask him for that chem set. He loves the nerdy kids. That’s how I fixed Ab-E. He bought me all the stuff I needed to repair her.”
he would be getting on Peter’s ass about that in the near future. Harley might have blushed too, Steve thought, but he couldn’t say for sure. Harley nodded, though, clearly comfortable talking to adults for the most part. Steve was impressed.
, Bucky slapped the blond man’s shoulder. “Whatever. Of course I got him the damn broccoli beef. Can’t kick Sam’s ass in the
Peter arrived in class 2 full minutes after the bell rang. His first period teacher, his chemistry teacher, Ms. Cowell, was extremely forgiving and kind of loved him, so she didn’t ride his ass about it for very long. Peter was immeasurably grateful for this. Thankfully, since he wasn’t late for any of his other classes, the office never called Steve about the tardies. Peter probably would have died if the school did such a thing.
of them was that he kind of wanted Harley to work on this set with him, and he couldn’t really invite Harley to if the set didn’t even belong to him.
But what hurts Tony -- in some weird, almost numb way -- is that he actually introduced Natasha to Virginia. She has red hair, so bright it’s blinding, and one of those smiles that leaves everyone’s stomachs twisting beautifully in its wake. She’s beautiful, and Virginia is too, and they’re both so determined and badass and hardheaded that of
When the time came for them to leave, Peter was more than ready to. Something Steve had always admired about Peter was his love of learning; when Steve was in middle school, the only thing worth going to school for was art class with Mrs. Lewis and lunch with Bucky. Even in high school, after Steve’s grades started improving (what with Bucky’s parents, Eleanor and George, being his caregivers, rather than Joseph Rogers) and he started bench warming for the baseball team in his freshman year, Steve never looked forward to any part of school beyond getting his hands dirty with clay and paint and charcoal (and whatever food Bucky decided to throw at him that day).
“Be nice to your uncle,” Steve scolded, sliding a plate of steaming pancakes in front of Bucky’s face. “He’s not a morning person.”
Well. Peter didn’t have a phone, so this concept - Peter, being out of Steve’s line of sight when he was very much supposed to be - left a gaping hole in Steve’s stomach. He was completely sick at the thought of Peter being anything
Steve smiles when he starts to respond and it’s so soft that it leaves Tony dizzy and starstruck in a way that he’s probably never felt before. “Apparently, because I know very little about technology, I’m an honorary grandfather.”
“There’s the grumpy old man I know and love,” Peter teased. Steve rolled his eyes at his son’s antics, but the fond smile on Peter’s face quickly dampened to a sympathetic one. “C’mon, Dad. Tell me what’s wrong.”
close. Peter used to think Wade was flirting with him whenever he did that, but that would be weird because Wade’s an 8th grader; fortunately, Peter recently uncovered the existence of one Vanessa Carlysle, and has since made it his mission to embarrass Wade in front of her at all costs.
There was a recurring dream that Steve kept having. Peter was setting up a picnic table with plates and forks, and Steve was flipping burgers on a grill. Sam, Bucky, and Natasha - Bucky’s partner - were all drinking beers, talking to the group of Peter’s friends over by the picnic table. Peter’s group kept growing; at first, it was just Ned, but in recent dreams, it’s grown to include Wade, Michelle, and as of late, Harley. Steve served Michelle and Natasha veggie burgers. Peter hugged Steve, arms wrapped around his waist and head buried in his chest, hair bristling Steve’s collarbone.
“We could put chilli flakes in the- Oh! Hey, Steve,” Clint said cheerfully, if not a little bit breathless. “These monsters enlisted me for pranking. I was forced to do it, I definitely did not agree slash volunteer to partake on my own volition.” Clint definitely directed that last part to May, who sighed, but was grinning nonetheless.
, he corrects, because he shouldn’t get to have nicknames for her anymore, not after he fucked everything up -- were good, sure, but he always knew it wasn’t meant to be. In the quiet early mornings, when Virginia was sleeping peacefully and Tony was struck with fear that was only halfway rational, the shifting from the body next to him provided him less comfort and more a sensation of deadweight against his scarred and torn arm. He would suffocate some nights, the pain in his chest on the wrong side of too-tight; it wasn’t Virginia’s fault. Tony was fucked up --
Steve held Peter’s face in his two large hands and pressed their foreheads together. Steve shut his eyes as he felt his son’s small, tender hands reach around and lay flat against his back. “What did I do to deserve such a good kid, huh?”
Tony’s kind of a well known face. He knows it. Really, everyone in his life knows it too. Tony had, just a little bit, expected Steve to ask about SI at
Rhodey pulls Tony closer on the couch and keeps him in his arms, “It wasn’t for a lack of trying, how many tall, blonde alphas  exist in the State of New York?”
A small smile appears on Tony's face, his baby boy knew what that Tony's was not going to share his feelings with him, thinking him much too young. He notices that something is bothering the young man, and he is figures that he needs to deal with this before going to the mine field that is his love life. And that thought gave him the confidence to continue into uncomfortable territory.
The screen then shows the neck of the illustrious omega himself standing at the alpha with his neck bared gently to the side. The alpha’s arms hold the omega close to him looking down with a slight smile.
Tony huffs out a laugh at his child's antics. Thor stops his brooding and thinks that Tony, with reddened-eyes and tears on his face, is still as beautiful as the day he decided to spend the night with him.
Loki shakes out of his reverie and rushes before the elevator close on him. As they start to descend, Loki realizes that this location is another one that has featured in his sexual fantasies. He is at a loss for words. As he tries to not give any indication of his thoughts, Rhodey asks him why he is looking for Tony.
“And we are back, to those tuning in, we have attained footage of the Stark family seemingly enjoyed a cross country trip,”
“You said we would do it together, even if they were not your blood,” Tony said loudly, “Where is ‘together’ now, huh?”
The omega pauses and is hit with a numb feeling in his heart. He was not lying, Tony had been unfaithful with a man that looked far too much like twin's father. The hardest part was knowing that their secret love would eventually end, and that Tony had cost his sons their father.
“He needed my connections to help find you, I thought you were good friends, there was nothing I wouldn’t do for him,”
"For so long, I believed it was enough that we could build a life together," he says softly, "It felt so real, I thought it would be enough."
Tony’s body shivers, but it wasn’t from the cold. He feels himself squirming from the look in Thor’s eyes. His eyes start to fiercely glow and his scent calls out to Thor, but the alpha waits. He needs Tony to verbalise his consent. The omega in Toy whines and scratches at the surface and Tony is doing all he can to not fall to his knees and shout out his consent. Tony must think about this decision, it is not about just him anymore, how will the twins handle this? How will their lives change? Will Thor move to the tower? Will he live in Philly?
“Stark, stop pretending you were a victim, you didn’t love me, you wanted to be wanted after that alpha left you pregnant,” Steve retorts,
“Would you have told me about Bucky earlier, would you have been with me, would you have been a hypocrite about cheating?” Tony asks, getting louder and louder.
“Approximately 146 of 100000 are above six foot three inches tall, though the numbers for natural blondes are ambiguous,”
Loki is seated less than a foot away, and Rhodey notices the cut of his jawline, the long eyelashes and those bright green eyes. He wonders if his skin is as soft as it looks and if those lips taste as good as they look. He shakes his head to remove these thoughts, he doubts that the relationship will ever get to a point where he can find out the answers to those questions. In the meantime, Rhodey wonders about what they had missed during the road trip.
Thor turned to embrace Tony, “Svass, I could never blame you for this, but the situation grinds at my instincts,” He said, “Those are my boys with another Alpha, he had the bond I so desired from my pups, and he hurt them.” He says angrily.
"I heard you two speaking, didn't want to interrupt," Thor whispers back as he lays behind Tony to cuddle in. The omega is shocked, he hadn't thought the man would want to be near him so soon. The omega rejoiced hesitantly, his alpha hadn't given up on them but the tension had yet to fully dissipate. Anything is better than nothing.
“We can clearly see Omega Tony Stark walking towards the ticket booth with who we assume are the twins in their blurry presence,”
“Oh no, dear, this barbaric sport would never appeal to me, I was adopted by Thor’s parents,” he responds, “My name is Loki,”
Rhodey receives a call from Thor for them to stay back a bit, the roads aren’t safe after the game. Tony decides to hit the snack bar, since the wait may very well take a couple of hours. The twins began to doze a little and Tony is becoming impatient,
Tony rushes out of Thor’s embrace to the closest vehicle, before he goes in, “I feel that I am not going to get back the Tony I know if I let you leave,” His face has no true sentiment, but his eyes shine with emotion.
Peter quickly rushed to Tony and begun to check for any bruises or pain from him, and shield him from Steve’s sight.
Tony blanks out for a moment, and traces back the last year in his mind. It has been eight months since Tony and the twins have seen Steve.  The child would have been conceived in January, a month before Tony cheated. This realisation makes Tony choke on air for a moment and James rushes to get him some water.
Thor and Loki are standing there even more confused, ask the dark-haired man is about to ask why this news matters, Tony mumbles, “Um, I’ll be right back,” He starts to make his way to the basement, “The Garage, JARVIS,”
“Who knows Cammy, but when you’re a billionaire, you can afford to do so, on to our next story, Steve Rogers has been seen with best friend James Bucky Barnes in what seems to be a romantic context,”
Thor and Tony were at an impasse. On one hand, they have feelings for each other, their instincts are pulling them closer. On the other, Thor is unable to get past Tony leaving to go see another alpha while they were trying to build something together. Both Rhodey and Loki were unsure on how to tread between the two. Rhodey feels he needs to support his best friend and Loki is feeling empathetic towards Tony; he knows what he feels like to love someone who doesn’t return the same feelings. So, the dark-haired omega decides to act, he needs to get to Tony out of his head.
Tony and Thor first notice how empty the room feels without the others and second, the intensity of their connection that pushes them to want to touch the other. They take stock of how the other looks some more.
“I have looking for you for a long time, I want to introduce you to some people who are important to me,” Tony mutters, “Peter, Harley this is Thor,” the twins greet the man with confused and frowned faces respectively. Tony wraps his arms around them and says,
Something seems to click, Tony turns to look at his pups with his glowing golden eyes. The twins realise that their mother was in his instinctual omega mode. They whine in response. The omega stands to come inspect them, nuzzling their heads and pulling them closer to him.
“I know I hurt you Tony, I thought by not saying anything about Bucky, that I was sparing you and now I can see I was only sparing myself,” Steve then looked up at Tony, “I am sorry, hopefully one day you can understand,”
I have about three more chapters planned but the way its looking I might even push hard towards four :)
Steve gaped at him, blinking in surprise. “Language!” he squeaked. “Who on Earth taught you to think it was okay to speak to your father like that?” Peter grinned.
“Ew,” says Steve, and Tony barks out a laugh. “Bucky has a thing for the purple one. It’s the exact same but instead of strawberry, it’s like - blackberry, or some shit. I hate it. I don’t really like coffee either, but it’s still worlds better than - milky fruit water.”
Harley beamed at Peter and Steve’s heart exploded into a million little pieces. “Sure,” he said, voice very obviously affected, though Peter was very obviously oblivious. “I’ll see you at dinner, then. And breakfast.”
Steve and Tony both turn, virtually at the same time, to face the direction the two oh-so-familiar voices, and Tony is only a little stunned to see a seated Rhodey being pushed by a long hair, one armed, Jesus man. Tony beams, even if there’s a pang in his chest at the sight of a wheelchair skidding across the airport floor with the strongest man Tony had ever known in tow.
At dinnertime, the two of them sat together, and talk about their day; Peter had a presentation in his Spanish class on direct and indirect object pronouns, and Steve’s class had to turn in their rough drafts for the art show in two weeks. Steve asked Peter if he was alright with Steve getting a second job, and though there really isn’t
“Rhodey,” Tony breathes, and all of a sudden he’s running, and the meters between them shrink to yards shrink to feet shrink to inches shrink to nothing, shrink to
- to show them to their room. They thanked Clint profusely too, but he said, “It’s no problem,” and waved it off. He added, as he turned back down the hallway, “Dinner is in an hour. And breakfast starts every morning at 7:00, goes until we run out of food. Be on time - we run out pretty quickly.”
He talked about all the things he was too scared to tell Steve, like how there was this chemistry set he wanted to save up for but didn’t even know where to start, and how the kids at school - namely, Flash Thompson - were mean to him whenever he got the answers right in class, and how there was only twelve school days left before summer and how he woke up every morning to check another day off, because he couldn’t wait until he’s free from all the bullshit.
and pants with a plaid, grid design, and his hair is sort of tousled in a way Tony can’t say for sure is purposeful or not.
Tony nods furiously. “I don’t mind at all,” he replies, his leg twitching just a little in the stupid anticipation of it all. “Really,” he adds, as if Steve doesn’t believe him. Actually, he thinks, Steve might not have, because there’s suddenly a slump in the blond’s shoulders and a sense of laze oozing off him.
The shelter they were staying at only housed people for a month. Steve called in a few days before to make sure there was room for a family of two, and the receptionist - May, who was very nice and thanked Steve for his service, which always struck Steve smack dab in the heart - confirmed that he and Peter could stay for thirty days, so long as they check in before 5:00 PM on the first of the month.
to leave. It was located in a really bad neighborhood, pretty much completely run by two rival gangs, and Steve was terrified to let Peter stay there for very long. Virtually as soon as they were able to move all their belongings to Bucky’s home, they did. As far as Peter knew, they moved because it was dangerous, too small, and the most
Tony feels tears in his eyes and leans on Thor’s shoulder and sobs quietly. Thor lets him rest his head there. He finally understands that being with Tony will contain impulsive actions and days spent alone, but the omega will come back to him to heal and be strong for the world once more.
When Tony enters the kitchen, he notices the twins and a couple of their trusted buddies asleep on the floor in the sitting room. Seeing Peter draped on his stomach at the edge of the couch and Harley with his legs on his twin's backside. He giggles at the sight, his children are adorable. He leaves them in their peace and goes to prepare his infamous toasted delight.
A comfortable silence fills the room, though this time, it has an edge of hesitancy and anxiousness. Thor reminisces on the years without Tony. The difficulty in sleeping alone with his warmth. The glimpse of his body in the morning night and difficult it was to leave him. It had made him irritable and distraught. He threw himself into football, and being the best.
“I’ll make dinner tonight, if you want,” Steve offered. Bucky spun around at that, and Steve would have been happy to see his face if not for the icy stare in his eyes.
Steve chuckles so genuinely it leaves warmth and electricity and thunder crackling all throughout Tony’s bones. “Well, I certainly don't blame you. It’s not all that easy to understand, even when you’re at boot camp.” Tony grins.
“Rhodey too,” replies Tony. “While we wait, why don’t you tell me about yourself? What are you doing since you’ve come back?”
He stuffed his sandwich further into his mouth. He wouldn’t think about that for now. For now, he’d focus on the sounds of his friends’ conversation delving into chaos while he sat, peacefully, in the middle of it all.
It wasn’t real life. Steve had to remind himself. It felt real. He wanted it to be real. But it wasn’t.
(To Steve, there was too much stuff and not enough time; to Peter, it was the other way around. That’s how it should
, maybe two -- Tony’s breath is caught in his throat and his stomach is flipped upside down and backwards.
art supplies at the beginning of the year, since the rich parents he worked for refused to fork up any money to donate to the art program. And Steve was selfish and materialistic and bought himself a fancy pack of pens and bought Peter a better MP3 player and they were already late for rent and they
Peter and Harley Stark, Alpha children of the illustrious Omega Anthony Edward Stark are the most affluent and mysterious teenagers in the western world. Their mother having bought controlling shares in companies ranging from motor vehicles to gaming devices, easily making their net worth nearly half of his own. The only time the news media ever saw their faces was in their presence, any attempt to take their picture showed a blurry spot on the image. The only clear picture of the twins is the one main foyer of the living spaces of the tower.
The man blinks once then decides to walk them to the locker rooms, with his hand firmly on Tony’s back. He can feel the warmth radiating from the point of contact and it takes all of Tony’s focus to not ask him to meet up in a bathroom stall.
Tony has a general idea of where he is headed, he simply refused to acknowledge that he is doing this; that he ran away from the people who truly care for him. Rhodey, whom had almost understood exactly what Tony is feeling and what he could do when in such a state. Harley, his fiery little star, who has been protective of Tony, but the omega knew that he had loved Steve in his own way, and when he left, the boy had become a little more solemn. Peter, his little sunshine, refused to watch or talk about Steve entirely, as though he doesn’t exist.
They finally reach the door, and as Tony turns to thank him out comes the twins practically beaming. They start talking over one another and Loki walks out after moment with a little smirk which fades as he sees Heimdall. The dark-haired man tries to herd the Starks off to the room, but Tony slips out quickly to say thank you to the coach.
As he approaches the only door on the floor, Tony realises that once that the door opens, he might not be ready. He might see the life that he wanted with Steve. To be public with their love.
Tony sighs and reaches for the coffee on the table and takes a sip. Loki stands to wait for a reason to justify his actions in the last couple of days and why his space was invaded by the blond giant. Tony explains that he went to see Steve in search of answers which he never received, but before he left, Thor caught up to him and told him that he is afraid that Tony would not be the same when he came back. He admits that the alpha was right. He wants to make things better between them and that had involved him closing the chapter on Steve but he could not even do that.
“Right, well there is Thor’s office, he has the best poptarts stored in his cabinets,” Loki stage whispers to the twins.
Tony takes a breath and looks at Thor with whiskey brown eyes, he wasn’t lying when he said one night would never be enough. The scent of rain and mint will follow him to his grave. The man gives off a predatory vibe, one that should scare Tony but it only pulls him closer. He wants it all.
He didn’t even remember to bar his access codes to the penthouse through the elevator. Did he wish for him to come back? Probably, in his own self-loathing way. He had hoped that the man would come back. Did he still want him to?
Rhodey and the twins all of a sudden shout and throw streamers in the air. The Eagles have won the SuperBowl. Half the stadium is going wild and the other is solemn and angry. Tony smiles at the joy in his children’s faces as they try to make him join in the fun.
Tony sits in the living room. It is incredibly awkward as James rushed to the crying baby leaving Tony to his own devices. He looks around for a moment, and sees a bunch of children’s toys littered on the floor, and a play area set-up, and a baby bag sitting by the couch. He also notes a weird stain on the back of the couch. Tony is not surprised at all, they do have a baby, but he is surprised when he notices the watch Tony got for Steve on their anniversary sitting on the side table.
“And where is the omega you left pregnant? Does he know the sort of alpha you are?” Tony sneered at him, “Does he know the sort of manipulator you are?”
Rhodey holds Tony in front of him,“Oh, Tony, you need to snap out of this, you need to leave this tower for a while,”
Harley decides to head up to the workshop, it wasn’t the first time that Steve had missed an activity with them this week and it was beginning to cause a minor freak out in the twins. After JARVIS opened the lab doors for them, they saw their mother sitting near the one of the cleared desks staring at the wall,
The soldier pulls Tony towards the giant windows, ”Look around Tony, you need to live your life, go sightseeing and clear your mind, hang out with your kids, they work too hard,”
Rhodes turns to see Loki standing there and smiles and Loki melts, “I haven’t yet, but I'm going down to the lab,” Rhodey lifts up the cups and starts heading to the elevator.
The slight widening of his eyes told Tony that Steve had expected more emotion from him. More deference, like he typically would give him. Though, Tony can understand why he would be. Whenever there were arguments between them, Tony would be the one to beg for forgiveness. In response, Steve, like the forgiving angel, would left him up and carry him inside. They would have sex and pretend that it was Tony who was in the wrong and ignore the issues that brought them to this point.
Thor sits there unsure of what to do. Tony had moved away from him yet he yearns to comfort his omega. He moves closer to bring the smaller man back into his arms and he is stopped. Tony hold his hands in his with his head downturned and the sound of sniffling reaches his ears.
Both Harley and Peter were home-schooled by the best tutors in the country, only having to attend four days a week and experiment with R&D the rest of the time or spend it with their mother in his workshop. Due to their fairly lax schedule, they had noticed the lack of Steve in the Tower. Harley steps out of the elevator and rushes over to his brother,
“Maybe you should have, maybe you should have left me alone when I told you to, maybe when you used me to find your slice of heaven and blamed me for wanting the same from you,” Tony shouts,
Thor and Loki have rented an apartment nearby the Tower for an easier commute. Rhodey questions why Loki had moved but the dark-haired man says he needed a change of scenery.  Loki returns from the kitchen to the couch and sits with Rhodey once more. The change in their dynamic has made the soldier more hesitant than confused. He can clearly see Loki is an attractive man, though the ten-year age difference tends to make him feel a little insecure. Rhodey is not as young anymore. His last relationship was with a beta, Carol Danvers, whom he believed was it for him. A difference in life goals caused them to split, it was not anyone’s fault, but it didn’t hurt any less.
Though Tony did not need to wait long as he was making notes for the architects for the new house, he was notified that Steve Rogers has entered the building. Tony remembered that the twins were Thor’s apartment helping Loki move into Rhodey’s apartment and Thor was getting gifts for the boys and refused to tell him what they were. This reminded Tony of when Steve left that last time, here he was standing in the tower alone expect this time Steve was coming back.
After a moment, Tony says quietly, “They were loud and boisterous, getting into trouble whenever I turned around. Harley often tried to mix chemicals to create puffs of smoke while Peter tried to make a car out of anything he could find,” Tony continued with a small smile, “They caused more than a couple grey hairs,” Tony huffs out a light laugh,
Tony had not thought that either of them would share anytime soon. He had given them a few more hours to express some emotion other than anger.
Tony opens his eyes and sees Rhodey hovering beside him, “Tones, are you alright?”, Tony quickly sits up and groans from the dizzy stroke his movement caused, “Mama, thank goodness you’re okay,” says Peter, “Don’t do that again, Mama,” Harley huffs out.
“Here we see Steve Rogers and James Barnes having a picnic down in Central Park with their baby girl, aren’t they adorable?”
“You know what, fine, go back to your boyfriend who I have spend thousands of dollars for you to find him and leave me for,” Tony shouts with tears in his eyes,
Loki freezes up for a moment. Instinctively, he wanted to scream yes and tear off all of James’ clothing and ride him like he hadn’t been before. But the more reasonable part of him paused and thought about it. It would be great to be bonded with such an alpha. He was in the army, has a steady flow of income. He seems to have strong genetics and features that would beneficial for their offspring. But mostly he is good, kind and caring. Exactly what Loki wants.
Tony blinks once, then twice, and shifts out from underneath Thor. He heads for the mini fridge and takes out a bottle of water for Thor and himself. He tells Thor that for what he is about to say, he needs them both to be clear minded and calm from their earlier activities. Thor continues,
It had nearly been a week and a half since Tony had stormed into Steve’s apartment with Bucky and Tony wondered when it would come to head when he saw how much time had passed. The omega knew that Steve would somehow respond, but Tony was not sure what his reaction would be. Would the love he had still be there, would he even stand up for himself? He was more worried about what Thor would do. The alpha would let out a short deep growl sometimes when he saw Steve on the television and Tony was afraid it would come to fists between them.
Tony loses the golden glow from his eyes and tries to steady himself for the children. He tries to explain the situation without making Steve seem as though he has left them, that he was the one who had done Steve wrong and that he does not believe he’ll take him back and that’s okay.
“The man in the image is the Coach of the Philadelphia Eagles, back from a recent Superbowl victory, an alpha in his prime,”
They exchange numbers under the watchful and dark gaze of Loki, and Tony pays it no mind and follows the gang back to Rhodey.
For three reasons in particular; Stark Industries needed a new headquarters in New York to facilitate the entirety of the company, Tony wanted to create the most secure and efficient building ever and to ensure that their family can be nearby to visit. A family that probably would not be coming by anytime soon.
“Famous actor and teen heartthrob, Steve Rogers seen leaving Stark Tower with bags on hand. When asked why he seems to be leaving, said that he and Tony have grown apart and that their friendship is not as strong as it used to be, but he will visit soon for the Stark twins because he still loves them. I wonder what could cause the friendship of the century to fall apart, Cammy?”
“I’ll stay for as long as you’ll have me, but even then, I don’t think I could leave you,” Thor states, “Tony, I need you to tell me if you want this with me before we go anything further,”
“You love my sons and you abandoned them, but sadly they love you back,” Tony admitted, “I won’t make them forget you, but I won’t help you fix this, that’s their business,”
Both Loki and Rhodey rush to the wreck room to check on Tony who has the biggest smile on his face. Thor is pretending to need Peter’s help to defeat Harley. The twins are also laughing, and Harley especially seems to have gotten attached to the blonde giant. Rhodes is afraid to ruin this tender moment between this growing family, but he feels that in the long run, it would be best that Tony deals with it now.
Steve simply stared at Tony stonily. Tony let out a painful laugh, “Right, I know,” he muttered, “Its only ‘together’ for what you want, not for all of us,”
Thor had gotten up to make some tea against Tony's protests for caffeine. The omega could feel the fatigue-inducted crying creeping over to him. He is stuck between wanting to hide away his tears, maybe Antarctica is great this time of year, or stay and face the alpha he ran away from to the one that may have never wanted him. As he sat there, the door suddenly opens to reveal Peter, who wanted to see his mother.
Knowing Harley was the sort to annoy until he got what he wanted, Rhodey found it best to simply tell them, “My choice is to watch football,””
Neither one of the brothers want to leave Tony and their supposed father alone but they are aware enough to see that their mama needs this time alone with Thor. They huff and decide to leave with the other adults in the room.
Tony wished they could simply stay in bed and not addressed the pink elephant in the corner of the room. The haze of the morning made all the worries seem so distant. It was lovely while it lasted.
Thor rushes to the elevator, “Svass, tell me what is going on,” Thor pulls him into a hug, “I can’t stand to see you so indifferent,” he whispers,
He cannot believe that man he had been thinking about for so long is right in front of him, he wants to reach out and touch him, to feel the electricity through him again. He notices that he has cut his hair, and he looks incredible enough that Tony only misses the long hair a little. He is not surprised that the man’s name isn’t Thomas, he had searched for all the Thomas’ in the country with the physical descriptors he very clearly remembered, and none had matched.
“It's your name, the one that you were given at birth, it is important to your identity, ”Loki breathes out, “I say it with care because I know how important names are, and that I like it because it's yours,”
“That’s because we were.” Tony states quietly, “We were in a relationship and we were a family,” James shakes his head, “No that’s not possible, why would he lie?”
“Peter, son, lis-“ Peter rushed toward Steve, eyes flashing red, “ You can never ever call me that again, you are dead to me,” The younger alpha was incredibly tense in his response, “You lost that when you left, so you can fuck off,” The usual chastisement was stuck in Steve’s throat.
“When I laid there that night we met, when your side of the bed got colder and colder, I thought to myself that if I ever see this man again, he will be my last. He will be the father of my children, my mate, my partner.” Thor declares, “My instinct to provide and protect often pushes me to the darkness and I have scared off more omegas than I care to count. So, I will ask one more time, could you handle it if I stayed?”
Andrew continues, “On the screen, Tony Stark is now seen with the coach of Philadelphia Eagles, Alpha Thor Odinson, and we can hear the wedding bells already,”
“He could leave again and I don’t think I could handle it,” Peter starts, “Besides he has another family, and we have ours,” Peter finishes with a little smile at Thor.
The omega reaches for the coffee, soaking in the warmth in the chilly living room, “It was happening so often that I didn’t even question it, I just wanted to keep the boys happy, they loved Steve and the others, I couldn’t take away their family again,” Tony puts the coffee on the table and cuddles in further, “Its my fault they haven’t met their father,”
Peter walks into the room saying, "Mama, can we stop by-", notices the tension in the air and briskly turns back.
The door to the penthouse opened to let Peter in, “Mama, have you seen where my-” Peter cut himself off seeing Steve in the room with his mother. His eyes flashed red and a growl emitted from his chest. Steve, responds to the challenge unconsciously which forced Tony to let out a purr to distract the alphas from a fight.
The voice is deeper than Tony had expected. The man is attractive, beautiful and young. Clearly an omega in their prime,
They stare ahead of them, neither courageous enough to look at the other. The alpha realizes a sigh and looks Loki,
Tony looks down at his child, he remembers him being so small, had run up to him crying that Harley broke his toy and found Steve in the playroom trying to fix the little action-figure. His hair was messed up, eyes focused, trying to bend the toy to his will with his hands. Steve had been good to his family, he was there when it mattered to the boys. But it hurt that he never was for him.
He swears he can still hear Thor laughing with the boys. He can still smell the musky cologne in his nose. All these memories do is cause him more pain. He wraps his own arms around himself to feel like he is still in his body.
The door opened once more, and Thor entered the room, "I was wondering if you had to grow the tea leaves yourself," Tony whispers into the dark room.
“Now, the Stark-Odinson family has revealed of the twins faces for the first time ever, thousands of omegas and beta and even some alphas immediately vying for the attention of the twin heirs,”
“What!” Andrew sputtered, “No, no no, we also have to consider the entire alpha population in America to be sure, knowing the free nature of Mr Stark,”
Tony gets thrown out of his inner monologue to see Peter, his little alpha with hardened eyes and stony expression.
He ends up in the kitchen where he sees James making some coffee for most probably Tony. He approaches him and tries not to imagine the alpha taking him on the counter. After taking a breath,
“I am so happy for the newly, emphasis on the engaged, couple after only eight months of dating and here we are,”
Eventually the little pack had to return to their regular lives, only after taking a couple more days to settle back in the familiar bonds. The twins were reassured by Thor, that he intended to stay for a very long time and Tony fought very hard not to cry at the puppy piles they had. Particularly when Harley called Thor, “Alpha”. Thor nearly broke the usually defensive little alpha in the hug, sweeping him off his feet. Harley pretended very hard not to like it with a growl, but Thor only laughed harder in response, “My fierce little pup,”. Their relationship seemed to only grow from there.
Tony settles with his first coffee of the day and watches Thor scruff down six slices of toast. Tony was more than confident in his skills, but feared that they would not be good enough for Thor. Seeing him enjoy his efforts soothes his omega.
“Oh, you’re Stevie’s friends, please do come in,” The smile he receives stuns Tony for a moment, the omega is radiating polite and warm energy and Tony hates that his own omega responds in turn. In that moment he feels insecure and the anger he carried for James dissipates.
Peter rushed over to hug Thor tightly and Tony could see a small wet stain on Thor’s shirt. Harley’s eyes were getting watery and Tony pulled him into a hug which he returned fiercely.
“I am sick of Thor moping in my room, its as if he is going through a break-up, I mean they aren’t, right?”
By the time they finish breakfast and manage to round up to twins back to the tower, an hour had passed. The rest of the morning saw the couple simply basking in each other's presence on the couch. Thor is laid on his back and Tony on side by the back of the couch, head resting on his alpha. Simply needed time to prove that they were okay. This calm before the storm made Tony incredibly aware of how much he loves Thor and that pushed him to take action.
It wasn’t the words that made Tony step back, it was more about the sheer numbness in the statement about the man who all but sired these boys. How the twins knew that Steve was not happy being a part of their little family.
Peter was not exactly sure how to answer this. He knows that his mother is feeling insecure after the news broke of Barnes' pregnancy and how Steve has been public about it. He wants to tell him how he still misses Steve and still sees him as the Head Alpha in their little pack. Even after he left and the abandonment he feels. He almost wishes he was like his brother and was able lock all these feelings away. It isn't fair how one man can break on family and be able to start another with no consequence. He didn't even tell us why.
“Where is Thomas?” Tony realises that the blonde god is no longer around, “He went to fetch the nurse, you’ve been passed out for fifteen minutes, wait, Thomas?” Rhodey questions,
Tony always thought that football was a sport that he neither loved nor hated. When Steve watched the games with Clint and Sam, he spent time down in the lab working. It had simply not appealed to him. So, when Rhodey said the name Thor Odinson, Tony could vaguely remember Sam and Clint arguing and this name being mentioned. He was expecting an older man, most likely an alpha. When their group finally made it into the VIP viewing area and after a few minutes, in walked a tall, black-haired omega with bright green eyes. Tony thought Thor was quite handsome.
"I miss Steve," He mutters out, "I hate him for leaving, but mostly he couldn't love us like he loves his new family,"
The tears in Tony’s eyes come with full force, as though a dam has broken through. He hiccups and sobs a little in the privacy of the tiny metal box, “Why can he still hurt me?” He asks Thor as the elevator slows to a stop.
