Dean huffs out a laugh when the last stroke of the razor leaves his neck clean. Only Cas. And once again, Dean feels struck down by the openness. “Yeah? How come?”
“Well, Mrs. Pogany was watering all of her potted plants with a hose as I was walking by. And I don’t know why but my brain was telling me I just had to feel it for myself, ya know? Before I even knew what I was doing I went right up to her and grabbed it out of her hand and sprayed the water all over my face. I was so damn embarrassed I just walked away, never said another word to the lady.”
“Neither of you are getting Christmas presents from me this year, so don’t hold your breath. And you know what else? I’m never letting
And then Cas looks so insufferably Cas when he says, “Oh, Dean, it’s sweet that you threw the word ‘trying’ in there. I think you meant, ‘succeeding’.”
Dean beams so bright he’s afraid Sam might see it across the tops of the headstones.
“I remember it so clearly. It certainly left an impression long past the time I woke up. You told me that you needed me to touch you because no one had ever touched you the right way. You said that their fingers went through you instead of touching you.”
Another beat. “Cas, anyone ever tell you you’re a genius? I was just gonna take my boxers off and hope I didn’t chafe too bad.”
Cas’s extremely sticky pants, however, not as much.
A beat of silence, and the shadow doesn’t move.
It is warm and sweet against his tongue. Like finding out he has a home, like the embrace of the two brothers. Castiel is sinking, sinking, like falling asleep.
’s sister record… that means the chances of him bawling like a baby are astronomical. And it’s not that he’s really ashamed of it, anymore. The last week has been good for all of them, in a weird way, this new crying pact they have.
Dean falters while his cheeks get hot. “I don’t- no.”
But Castiel takes pity and eases the fly of Dean’s jeans down. He looks even more delectable through the flimsy material of his boxers, and Castiel drags his knuckles down the area tentatively. Dean shakes like he’s crumbling apart, his stuttering breath puffing hot against Castiel’s cheek.
, and the
Cas leans further across Dean’s body to do it to Dean’s left nipple, too, before he catches it between his lips and tugs lightly.
Dean doesn’t seem bothered by his lack of response. “You sleep okay?” He putters into the room.
Dean finally looks down at Sam, a tear dripping from the tip of his nose, and he feels like the little brother.
When he finally approaches the stall, he sees two figures through its white trim, and actually, his nerves are still there after all.
“Don’t,” Castiel says resolutely, not even giving Dean enough space to turn his head to look up at him. Dean breathes into the wet fabric. “I don’t need to read your mind to feel the shame coming off of you right now. You have nothing to be ashamed for.” The hand squeezes again. “In all of the years that I’ve known you, I have never seen you as brave as you are right now.”
Dean curls his hands into fists around the fabric of the guy’s shirt. Holds them there. Stares without blinking with a blunt sort of wrath so hot that it quiets again, the way that flames burn blue.
gets Dean’s attention. His eyes open as his eyebrows furrow against Cas’s shoulder. “Are you really that strong?”
Dean is a faulty wire. His brain sparks trying to put two thoughts together but nothing happens. Castiel is still staring down at him, grinding into him like the world’s greatest weighted blanket that can make you come. The words beautiful and loved and safe rattle around inside his head like they might finally stick for the first time in his life, because Cas is safe on top of him, and Dean is safe below him. All at once, the press of their bodies isn’t enough.
Castiel stares at the back of Dean’s head with what he assumes are comically wide eyes. “Yes, I guess that’s what I’m saying.”
Castiel watches him like he understands the difficulty Dean is having with getting the words out, but it’s tinged with curiosity.
When he opens his eyes, Dean is staring at him. “Cas, you might be the craziest motherfucker I know. And that’s saying something coming from me.”
That makes Dean set the now fully assembled gun back down on the counter with more force than necessary. He huffs an irritated breath out his nose because that’s a low blow even for Sam, who knows exactly the kind of soft spot Dean has for Eileen. But Dean also knows that Sam probably isn’t lying just to get him to talk. The image of Eileen’s concerned eyes right before he stormed out flash in his mind.
“Like, I don’t know, not all-” Dean clears his throat and pitches his voice down into a rumble, “
It’s just past two in the morning and Dean can’t sleep. His wings itch to be loose in a way that they haven't in years, and he can’t figure out why. But it’s two in the morning and he’s in his boxers and there’s no way in hell he’s going anywhere, so he rolls his shoulders back against the phantom discomfort where he sits up in bed.
And there’s that smile, that close-lipped Cas smile that brings the corner up further to one side like maybe he barely knows how to smile at all but the sheer need to show his happiness seeps out into his vessel. Dean loses his breath. It’s enough, for now, to keep reaching out even though he’s terrified of the way his words could be used against him.
“I mean,” Dean continues, “even if you went to the town fires, would you have any fun?”
. It makes Dean’s fingers itch to reach across and grab Cas’s hand, so he does. He squeezes the fingers wrapped in his and Cas looks like a snowman melting under the sun.
“Butterflies,” Cas replies.
“I don’t have to know you to see you.” Castiel watches Dean flinch, an unreadable emotion behind his eyes. “Hell is full of rot. It is a foul, disgusting place fit for the worst of humanity. You did not belong there. I’m glad I could correct that wrong.”
Pulling away just enough that he can look Cas in the eyes, Dean damn near whispers with a strange mixture of tenderness and urgency, “Sweetheart, are you close?”
Dean turns to him. “What d’you mean?”
“She what?”
“That’s not suspicious at all,” Eileen says sarcastically.
“Yesterday, Dean explained the phenomenon of The Butterflies you get when someone you’re attracted to makes you pleasantly nervous. I told him earlier today that when he tucked the tag of my shirt in it gave me The Butterflies, and he said he’d tell me when he felt them, too. Which is apparently… now.” Cas’s hands hang in the air for a second on the last word and then drop into his lap.
A gentle breeze starts through the trees and rustles their leaves in quiet song. It’s a whisper of a thing. Cas could be that wind, Dean thinks. He doesn’t feel like crying but his eyebrows pull up like he’s going to anyway, his bottom lip shaking. Because here he’s been so worried, so caught up in distancing himself from- from whatever this thing between him and Cas is because Cas is a dude and Dean is a dude and he’s never- he shouldn’t- even though he wants- and he never even realized that somehow he started feeling things about a warm light on the inside of that male body that Dean maybe likes a little bit too much in the first place. A warm light that can give hugs goodbye, a moon that uses emoticons in texts. Dean’s best friend.
“That might be the cutest thing I’ve ever seen in my life.”
Castiel continues, “I love you differently than I love Sam. Not like a brother, or a friend.”
“So, this guy- the one I look like. What’s his deal?” Dean finally says and chances a glance back up at Cas. He’s not surprised to find Cas watching him.
Then Cas is kissing up his neck, over the line of his jaw, all the way to Dean’s lips where Cas catches them. It’s an ocean-tide type of thing that rises and falls, their heads rocking together to find better angles and better tastes. Here, it’s like a whole conversation happens without any words. Dean doesn’t know whether the flavor of affection or hunger is more prominent, but he tries to give just as good as he’s getting, tries to tell Cas how much he wants him in every way that matters.
Now Dean feels like even more of an ass. But something still doesn’t sit exactly right, not with the way Mystery Man looks so unnervingly somber right now, the type of sad that’s just under the surface and spreads out in vines that suffocate you. Dean knows that sadness. So he runs the stats again in his head.
Dean opens his mouth for words that don’t come out, replaced instead by a shaky exhale.
Dean closes his eyes and lets the yellow nostalgia of the melody settle into the air around him. Here, safe in Cas’s neck, where the angel doesn’t wear cologne but he smells clean and bright the way he always does after he’s been in Heaven for a few hours. And it sort of feels like rediscovering that trust in Cas all over again.
Both of Castiel’s eyebrows draw up now. “You… have a surprise for me.” It sits right between a disbelieving statement and a question.
“Dean, may I- I- I’m going to-”
Yes, Dean thinks as sleep pulls him under much more kindly than it has in years, it is a good night.
Dean’s face opens, closes, opens like saloon doors as Castiel speaks, and he finds it fascinating to watch the shift. There is something buried in there, even under the oranges, that makes Castiel feel curiosity that vibrates and writhes.
Dean made a sympathetic noise in his throat and reached out to hold Ella’s tiny shaking shoulders. “Oh wow, that sounds really scary, Ella. But don’t you worry, ‘cause you’re in good hands now. In fact, I think this is Charlie and I’s next quest!”
Dean doesn’t know how to answer the implied question in the statement. With a groan, he forces himself to sit upright, bringing his knees in towards his chest and hanging his head between them the way he’d taught Sammy to do when the kid got the flu in eighth grade and couldn’t stop puking. He breathes.
He plates the burgers while he listens to the conversation unfold at his back.
Strong arms wrap around his waist, pull him backwards until Castiel’s back is pressed against Dean’s chest. Dean’s breath is warm in his ear. Castiel wonders if Dean was as ridiculously aroused by the sensation when Castiel was whispering in his ear as Castiel is now that the roles are reversed.
With a gulp, Castiel finds himself saying, “I wish that I did.”
Dean is moving again, pushing the door open. “It’s fine, Cas. Castiel,” he mumbles.
It is not cold, but he feels like shivering as his navel is revealed to the air, then the skin stretched across his ribs, then his nipples, the progress only stopping when the shirt catches underneath Castiel’s armpits. He brings his arms up to reach towards the blue sky, and then he’s not wearing a shirt anymore.
“I don’t know, Cas! I don’t know! I didn’t really think it was a big deal. It was my spot and it was your spot and I didn’t wanna move. We share it. Okay, big whoop. And then you start talking, and I still didn’t feel like leaving, so I stayed. Maybe- Goddammit, Cas, would you look at me?”
“Well, I’m here,” Sam says, “and you’re wrong. But I think you kinda know that already.”
Cas pushes all the way into the bathroom, closing the door again behind him. When he scoots past Dean to get to the other side of the room, his hand presses briefly against Dean’s lower back as if in greeting. “You’re always interesting, Dean,” Cas says simply, and then closes the toilet lid to sit on top of it.
Castiel should tell him. Castiel really should tell him. He doesn’t know how to say it, so he doesn’t say anything.
“We were going to tell you eventually, but we didn’t want to hurt your feelings,” Eileen says through a grin.
Eileen isn’t even bothering to stifle her laughter, letting it echo freely off of the walls. Dean doesn’t want to admit that he’s a little amused as well, a happy part of him curling up inside at Sam’s ecstatic reaction, because, yeah, Dean finally got his head out of his ass. When he glances at Cas, the angel is smiling as well, and Dean reaches over to grab his hand. He squeezes, and Cas squeezes back.
“Alright Cas, I see you. Making my way towards you now.” And then, ‘cause Dean thinks he’s funny, he finishes with, “Copy. Roger. Over and out.” With that, he starts his trek towards the glow coming from about the length of a shooting range off from him. Through the trees that smell like apples, while some of the fallen fruits that didn’t quite make it to maturity squish decayed under Dean’s boots every few feet.
Because Dean had come back to the honey stall. He had asked for Cas specifically to thank him for his honey recommendation. And then, miraculously, he had seemed to understand Castiel in a way that no one else ever had, like it was the easiest thing Dean had ever done. So natural that it became thoughtless. He’d looked so lovely, so at peace in the early gray morning with no one watching him, as he’d told Castiel all about how the Acacia varietal was his favorite.
When Eileen’s eyes widen, Sam turns around to investigate. He looks at Dean curiously while Eileen signs
There is something about Dean Winchester, he thinks, something safe. It sticks in Castiel’s throat, as though in reminder that even though he doesn’t have his memories, he has the phantom sensation of them.
His mind is heavy. His mind is blank. He stands on legs that feel so weak that they shouldn’t be able to hold him.
Dean’s brain crashes for about two whole seconds before it stutters back on again. “Right,” he says distantly. He looks down at his own dick. “Right.” Holding the bottle a few inches above his erection, he lets the lube drizzle down his arm skin. And it’s so cold, and he’s so sensitive, that his breath hitches. When it’s done, he recaps the bottle and throws it to the side again. “Lube: Done.”
“Mmhmm, yes I do. So how about you do Charlie and me a huge,
Finley shakes her head.
“I’ve upset you,” Cas says. “I’m sorry, that wasn’t my intention. Perhaps you should help me back into my vessel now.”
“In a red bag?” Castiel guesses, his voice distant. His eyes won’t focus, exactly.
Somehow, Dean feels like he’s the other cowboy here. All the hookups and the pointless sex, a reputation that followed him around, one where he took love where he could get it. And then he hit 37 and suddenly he couldn’t find it in himself to pick up girls anymore. He thought he was just getting old, ‘cause he was an idiot. Is still an idiot. I mean, erectile dysfunction makes a lot more sense than being in semi-gay love with your heavenly best friend, right? He and Cas weren't even officially together for those five or so years, but Dean was off the market the whole time.
Dean doesn’t look up when he hears the book being set down at the end of the table he’s sitting at, or when the chair across from his is pulled out and someone sits down in it. He knows he’s being a child, but his gnarled knuckles are much safer than the blue eyes he can feel trained on him.
“Hello, Dean,” Castiel greets. “It’s good to see you.”
The expression on Cas’s face crests even as his eyelids are squeezed shut, his jaw clenched. “
Dean likes knowing what Cas likes. And so what if he starts to recognize the ASMR peoples’ faces? Which ones Cas gravitates to, like the girl with the pink hair that Dean now knows calls herself A.L.B.
“Dean,” Cas prompts fleece-quiet.
“Yeah, yeah, it’s hilarious. Now that you know my heavily guarded secret, are we still doing these drawing lessons?”
“Very, very close,” he confirms again. He leans in to look at Dean’s hardness even nearer, rests his stubbled cheek on Dean’s thigh, drags it across the skin in the scratchy way that he knows Dean likes.
“So, you in?” Dean asks because he already knows the answer.
“Then what does it feel like?” Cas asks thoughtfully.
“I double”- here, Dean draws a two- “everything to make sure I have enough pancakes to feed everyone, so keep that in mind. Keep in mind that all of the measurements I tell you are double”- another two- “the original recipe, R-E-C-I-P-E.
Because Dean’s wings had done their charming impression of puffballs when Dean had gotten them out earlier. Castiel hadn’t mentioned it when it happened, though he’d definitely been watching close enough to see it. And now that Dean thinks about it, he’s pretty sure Linden’s wings did the exact same thing everytime that Cas came to the clearing to visit him. Dean is a thousand percent sure they’re both thinking about it and the fact that this book from the library had just shown Dean’s whole ass.
But then, as if the holy choir (or maybe just Jack) was smiling down on him, another, more recent, Gibi video appears with the words ASMR for Beginners large on the thumbnail:
Finley opens her mouth in what is obviously about to be a polite protest.
He clears it and looks back down at his beer. Still half-full. He takes a pull from it for no other reason than to do something with his nervous energy. Something about Cas almost seems… familiar isn’t the right word at all. In fact, he seems the opposite of familiar. He seems other. But Dean’s never met other like this before, an other that is… comforting. An other that is somehow awkward at the same time that it is severe at the same time that it is kind. He wants to resist it just because of how much he doesn’t.
When he looks back up, the swan is swimming in a lazy circle and dipping its head below the water before surfacing again.
Somewhere down some cobbled road a mile away, he guesses that Dean is sleeping comfortably.
“Dean, what’s wrong?”
Dean turns to face Castiel as he opens his mouth to speak, but whenever his eyes meet Castiel’s, his mouth snaps shut. He’s wearing a pinched expression full of the oranges that he thinks he’s hiding. Finally, he opens his mouth again. “Any requests for dinner, 50 First Dates?”
“Cas?” he calls softly.
. It gives him a nice break for the time being, but if his hunch about the album pattern is right, this reprieve isn’t gonna last all that long before he gets the metaphorical shit beaten out of him again.
“You think I was gonna hold your hand and then not kiss you afterward? Buddy, man, Cas, we’ve been doing the foreplay thing for about a decade now.”
“Right…” Dean says a little awkwardly. “Well, since this is happening, apparently, what’s your name?”
Dean’s eyes catch his in a flick through the rearview mirror before they’re on the road again. “Yeah, and?”
And even though Castiel is squirming and nervous about the thought of being this close to Dean, of being in Dean’s presence for any extended amount of time, he cannot deny how much he enjoys both Eileen and Dean’s company. He thinks that perhaps the game won’t be so bad at all if he has them here to watch it with. So he smiles and accepts her invitation with a “That sounds wonderful,” as he sits in the spot she’s made for him. This close, Castiel can smell the floral perfume she’s wearing.
" Damnit ", as he stands up.
Dean is standing and watching the coffee run ... Drip by drip...
« Stop parading like a peacock.
« They love you, you know » Dean whispered.
His hand travelled up and brushed the other’s hair. He kissed him again, but this time, with more passion and desire. He pushed Castiel towards the armchair; he lost his balance and ended up sitting with a laughter.
« Dean » she stepped closed and took his hands in hers. He squeezed them, avoiding to look at her.
"I think it's time I gave up my place," John whispers in his son's ear.
« Just imagine you’re turning gay, or that you’re facing a really gorgeous chick… » she corrected as she watched the waiter losing his grip.
« Excuse me? » Dean couldn’t hide his surprise.
« Is that what you’re scared of ? Don’t be. You should know that making love with someone of the same gender is a lot more exiting, especially between men, because we have a HUGE advantage » Balty smiled a wicked smile.
« So wh… » He suddenly understood. « Are you telling me… You mean, he was the victim of a… a homophobic aggression, is that what you’re trying to tell me ? » his face froze in disbelief.
He started to set the table and suddenly stood still.
« I’ll be back in 5 » softly hitting the door frame.
« You’ll find the snowshoes in the barn » he added with a little smile.
It was Friday… Neither Castiel nor Dean had managed to wipe the other’s face from their mind.
« Hi. »
« Hi » Jo said, now standing next to the bed. Castiel opened his eyes.
« You know what ? » Dean called as Castiel was leaving with his bag in his hand.
« So you’re gonna say yes ?» Chadwick asked as he stood up.
Bobby’s farm wasn’t such a big compound. He had a henhouse, a few cows, a bull and an old retired draft horse. He also had a corn field stretching up the hills surrounding the valley.
« You rode Shetland poneys… I’m impressed... » he said, pushing his hat on the back of his head and looking preoccupied.
Dean closed his eyes, trying to contain the anger within and swallow the lump in his throat. He was losing her… irreparably.
« Just asking » Chad replied with a smirk.
He softly brushed away the lock of hair on her forehead.
Nevertheless, she remained there, with her arm still extended.
« Sorry, but when conversation revolves around sex, I find it exhilarating » she whispered, leaning towards him.
« What are you talking about ? This horse loves you… C’mon, let’s try again »
« You seem to forget that your little puppy will one day weigh more than a hundred pounds »
« With pleasure… Can you take care of the appetizers while I preheat the oven »
Sam couldn’t take the tension which only seemed to grow between the two people he cherished the most.
“I certainly will.”
He felt like shouting but remained silent. Finally, he had been able to love Dean. He had seen the desire in his eyes, aiming at him, just this once. An image etched on his memory for ever...
A Castiel who was shouting through this kiss, made it more intense, forcing his teeth and tongue without tenderness. Dean searched under his shirt and touched his skin, he felt Castiel shiver before he pulled away and dropped his forehead in his neck. Dean let him recover and gently squeezed him against him.
« Leave it to me »
« What ? The pictures? »
He looked at her, surprised by her reaction.
« Meet my unworthy son! » he said as he handed a bill to the hot dog seller.
« Yes… I have to work early tomorrow » a bit surprised by the rather familiar way the man was speaking to him.
" Why aren’t you at work ? " he peaked at the wall clock.
« Chad ... Watch out, you’re gonna fall on your face » Dean warned him.
Lukewarm water mixed with their pleasure.
« Cass... In your op… » He saw his friend laying on the bed he’d chosen.
« This young man has good taste »
« Eat » and then she left him alone.
He started the ignition and drove ahead, staring at the road, not really deciding where to go.
« Very well, Madam » he turned around.
Castiel joined him and handed him a roller.
« That’s a way to put it » he started to laugh, feeling more relaxed.
Dean doesn't dare to breathe. Do not dare to hope. Doesn't want to believe for fear of having in return nothing but disappointment. He keeps his eyes fixed on the old bar floor.
Castiel softly teased his nipples. Dean unexpectedly reacted, grabbed his hand to keep it on his chest, seeking its warmth on his skin.
« Hi » Chadwick said with a bit of hesitation.
He threw away the pizza boxes, petted Apache one final time and looked around to check everything was clean and in place.
« What ? Shut up » Bryan was laughing as his hand crawled under his t-shirt.
« What about Castiel ? » Dean was on the defensive.
« Understand what… eventually ? » Dean repeated as he walked towards them.
« Don’t… I’m not finished » Castiel immediately said.
« Well, at least it’s easy to please you, kids» he said, winking at Jo who smiled at him. « Your father and your aunt used to require a different breakfast each and every morning »
“Then that means I’ve just lost one hundred dollars.”
As each year on Halloween’s day, Dean got up earlier to prepare the Horror Breakfast...
He was angry at himself for feeling a bit of jealousy that wasn’t justified anymore... He had come here to focus on something else and not keep turning over what had been eating him since that last bloody Thursday.
« Who’s paying for this ? » Dean asked to Castiel.
Not even a minute has passed before Dean begins to snore softly. Castiel shakes his head and presses another kiss into Dean’s hair.
“Lovely Dean,” Cas says softly, and Dean’s face feels even hotter.
“Oh no, not at all,” Dean says. His voice is all charm even as his face is a little bit shy.
Now, Dean raises both eyebrows. He stretches out his hand and drums his fingertips on the table. “Well, that’s good to hear. Ever thought that I might just want to know what you’re up to even if it’s not bad?”
“And if I heard correctly,” Cas chimes in, “the loser is buying drinks.”
God, how does Cas manage to make Dean feel like a fucking teenager blushing over something their crush said? ‘Cause Dean is definitely blushing when he mutters, “Thanks,” under his breath.
“How could you possibly know that there’s no music playing?” Sam finishes for him, hands moving fast.
It fractures in Castiel that he did that. He put that mark of harm on Dean. Dean, with his sun-adjacent smile and hands that guide children back to their mothers. Who just wanted someone to talk to him like he was a person.
, will be out tonight at midnight eastern.”
“You’re not too bad yourself,” Dean says, and rests a hand on Cas’s cheek. It makes Cas smile. Dean wants to see more, wants to say more. He takes a breath and tries to remember how to be suave. He used to be good at this. “Those pretty blue eyes. You could turn someone into a puddle just lookin’ at ‘em. And this mouth,” Dean runs his thumb along the seam of Cas’s lips, “very kissable. I’d know.” He grins at his own brag.
The thing turns its head to look at him as it rips Castiel down the center.
Angels do not wax poetic about human beings. Perhaps that is why Castiel isn’t an angel anymore.
“Fine,” Dean huffs, but lets his legs support his weight when Cas carefully lowers him to the ground.
“Don't you understand?” Castiel snarls. He fists Dean’s shirt and shakes the man bodily with all that anger, all of that hurt. “This is what I had. This is what I had.” Those messy tears are across his face now, sliding in all directions until his cheeks are flooded by shallow water. “This is all that I had.”
“But hey, look at us now,” Dean teases. “Nothing beats the real thing, huh?”
“A little bit, yeah,” Sam shrugs, and Dean rolls his eyes before going back to his drawing. “Eileen and I saw you out here from the kitchen window and I got curious.”
The rest of
“I guess I couldn’t say one way or another.”
The orb does a funny little wiggle that throws moving shadows over the apple trees around both of them. Dean’s eyes widen in alarm and the wind chimes twinkle. “That was a very good impression, Dean.” The ringing is higher now. It almost sounds like…
“You were the first person to ever hug me,” Cas murmurs without any prompting. Dean’s throat goes tight again. “You’re very good at it.”
“Yeah,” he murmurs, “I have. I think most people have, to be honest. I mean, there’s some pretty specific and, uh, not technically necessary shit out there, Cas. I’m talking people who dress up like horses and people who’re into feet and people who wanna be electrocuted. I mean… the
“I’m okay for now. Seems like most of the dudes got tired of waiting for a strip tease and left, but I’ll let you know if I need you.”
,” he moans out loud himself, just because he can, because he has to let some of the massive feeling out of his chest. A feeling too big to be named yet.
“Dean,” Castiel interrupts. Dean’s mouth snaps shut, and he looks grateful that Cas put him out of his misery. “What side would you like the hickey on?”
Cas smiles at Dean mischievously, as if giving him permission, and since Dean is the older brother and also the best storyteller of all time, he begins. “So, Cas injected my brain with this miracle juice-”.
“Yes, many hundreds… thousands of years ago, I’d say. Angels aren’t the kindest of species by any means, but there were a few of us, when we were young, who would sneak away to… I’m not sure if there’s a word in the English language to describe it. I suppose the closest comparison would be braiding a friend’s hair, the same way that human children do. It was frowned upon even then, but there have always been angels that have felt too much. That phenomenon isn’t new.”
It’s Dean.
He wants to show Dean how that feels. He wants Dean to know. So he kisses Dean’s neck again, curls his lips back like some prehistoric instinct where the mouth is the gateway to the heart and licks into Dean’s skin. It’s sloppy in a way that Castiel has never been before, but exhilarating, like he can press his love into Dean’s very body through a warm tongue and saliva.
, “four teaspoons of baking powder,”
Dean automatically glances up to where the real Charlie and Cas are still sitting together, though their eyes have opened since the last time Dean looked at them, and it seems like they’re talking quietly to each other. “Yeah, that’s Charlie.”
He needs to find a pattern in what Cas likes. He also needs to figure out how this tingle thing works in the first place. There’s no way in hell that he’s going into this cold.
“Mmhmm, and your dress is, like, the best shade of pink ever,” Charlie agreed from where she stood over the two.
“Uhhh- Cas? You sure you’re alright?”
And Dean really should learn to never underestimate this woman because she just shrugs her shoulders and says, “I had a good time.”
“Totally,” Dean grins back with the phrase that he’d semi-annoyingly picked up from Charlie, and he really means it. If Anna’s gaze on him felt heavy before, it’s almost unignorable now. But Dean presses through it, through his own anxiety too, because his curiosity is killing him. “Listen, I swear I’ve seen Anna around at some of the town fires and stuff, but I don’t think I’ve ever seen you before. Maybe I just don’t get out enough, huh?”
“Gotta keep her motivated somehow. When we’re done she gets thirty minutes of uninterrupted swan drawing time with Linden.” Then Dean takes a shuffling step closer so that the edge of the serving window counter digs into his chest and he’s as much in Castiel’s space as he can be without Castiel meeting him halfway. He’s whispering now as he adds, just for Castiel to hear, “Speaking of which, I think if you decide to check on the Linden apiary in about- uhh- two hours, give or take, there’s probably gonna be someone there waiting for you.”
It is the first time he has said the words aloud, or even really acknowledged them head-on. They’re not as scary as he thought they would be. A gentle breeze picking up to carry his voice away is the only acknowledgment he gets from the clearing.
“Well, I suppose that's more of the odd part I was referring to.” Now when Cas says it, the bleakness that he’d had before is replaced by something sweetly shy. He dips the tip of his pointer finger into the bowl. When Cas lifts it back up, Dean watches a bead of water drip to his second knuckle. “I thought that I could-” and then that finger is coming at Dean’s face. It makes contact with the center of his forehead before it draws a faint and damp line down his nose.
He observes the quiet pulsing of Dean’s soul. It’s mint green, a blending of curiosity and apprehension and excitement. Castiel continues to rub his head.
in comparison to
“I trust you,” Dean replies.
He opens his eyes and lets himself look at Cas. He lets himself look the way he never has before, without shame tugging in the bottom of his stomach with cruel words that mock him because he knows he can’t have this. But he can, now. Cas is everything molded into an angel that’s trapped inside an impossible bottle. Dean’s favorite company.
But Castiel doesn’t know how to answer that. He doesn’t even know if there is an answer.
Wonder why?” And when Charlie makes puppy dog eyes at him, he shakes his head. “No. Oh, no no no. You walked your ass here, you’re gonna walk your ass home.”
Intrigued, boiling, Castiel moves his hand faster where he would normally slow. He sends even more potent pulses of grace through his palm and fingertips.
“It seems that the Winchester brothers had a similar experience last night,” Cas finally chimes in with amusement.
He bets they look like idiots. Two naked grown men, dicks swinging, one of them clinging to the other. Dean doesn’t really care though because Cas’s big hands are riding just below his bare ass. He rests his head on Cas’s shoulder again.
“Heal my brain?” Dean shoots back incredulously.
He tilts his head in thought as he scans the area with his eyes for some sort of inspiration. They land on the now-empty parchment that his sticky bun had been wrapped in.
Cas hums amused into the warm summer air.
“These last few days have been hard on you.” It’s not a question. “I’m sorry.”
Now, it's Cas’s turn to frown. “It doesn’t specify in the book, but I would assume it’s derived from the Latin term for shoulder.”
There’s an indescribable shift in the room like the air pressure dropped so rapidly that Dean’s eardrums feel it. He starts, and when his head whips to the right, Jack is standing in the library doorway smiling.
For a moment, they’re both still, like neither of them is exactly sure how to continue. They hold against each other and breathe. Breathe. Their noses pressed into cheeks until a few heartbeats have passed and Cas carefully tilts his head. Dean nods up into it with more pressure as he parts his lips into something that Cas can work with. Cas’s right comes up to cradle Dean’s cheek, the pad of his pointer finger rests against the corner of Dean’s eye.
Finally, Cas relents, and Dean doesn’t know if he’s grateful or not when that warm palm leaves his dick in favor of shoving his pants down his legs and to the floor. Dean kicks them off his ankles and then pulls Cas bodily to him so that they’re pressed together naked all the way down. They’ve sorta done this before, but it’s real different now that they’re both hard. It’s weirdly fucking intimate, at the same time that his nerves are firing a thousand times per second. Dean grinds his dick into Cas’s, and his toes curl into the carpeting under him.
Fuck, does that mean- What does that mean? All those things Cas said, all that fucking affection, and it was for Dean the whole time. Every adoring word.
“I guess…” he starts slowly. “It just feels like I’m pretending to be one, for other people’s sake.” When he glances up at Cas, it’s to find a patient expression already turned in his direction. Cas nods at him, so Dean continues. “They don’t wanna watch some sad sack of shit walking around town crying all day. They want entertainment, or maybe just the unattainable, I don’t know. I think they want me to be a person just as much as they don’t want me to be.” He shakes his head, and suddenly he’s reminded of the weight of Cas’s hand on his neck. “That didn’t make any sense.”
Castiel hasn’t told a single soul about what he witnessed. He knows if he told one person, even Anna, that the story of that night would spread through the town like wildfire. Dean Winchester, one of the most handsome bachelors this side of the kingdom and one of the infamous Swans, asking a lost child if they wanted to hold his hand. Castiel thinks that every available woman, no matter their age, would propose on the spot.
The question is slightly unnerving, especially considering Castiel’s otherworldly background, and he wonders how much of the truth he should tell. But the two men at least knew what witches were, so they must be somewhat aware of the supernatural.
“Yes,” he lies for the first time. “I think I understand.”
The thing is, Dean sorta gets it. And there’s something about being chosen by Charlie, too, that just makes you feel real good about yourself.
“I love you, too, stupid.”
Eileen just smiles coyly, “You don’t know everything about me. How do you think I’ve been hunting for so long? You pick up on things.”
“It’s about Castiel, actually. We were cleaning out some witches and one of them must have hit him with something while we were fighting, ‘cause, uh, he doesn’t know who Dean and I are.”
“Perhaps,” comes Cas’s deep voice from Dean’s periphery. “However, flying is much more practical.”
Dean very purposefully presses his lips into a kiss on Cas’s hand. He maneuvers their tangled fingers until he reveals the pale inside of Cas’s wrist, and then he kisses that, too.
Dean chuckles, deflates, like all of his anxious energy left him in a whoosh of air. He continues smiling when he squeezes Cas’s hand and says, “Sorry. I just…” Dean shakes his head.
Castiel’s stomach drops as quickly as it boils.
He hears careful footsteps approach, but he doesn't look up. A shadow looms over him.
Dean isn’t nervous, exactly, just sort of… antsy. He clutches at the little honey stick in his hand, the one with a pink cap at the end of it, as he walks the dry dirt road of the marketplace. Dust kicks up at his boots, soft crunching steps that keep him company in his resolution of pace against the feeling of eyes on him.
His brow furrows and he frowns up at the stars when he hears the telltale sound of wings to his right. Dean ignores the way his stomach flips over, the way he can feel his soul pulling in Cas’s direction, and the way that it sings out
For some incomprehensible reason, Castiel feels his face heat up. There are so many strings connecting points between what Castiel remembers and what he doesn’t, and so many of them lead back to Dean. The clementines make him feel exposed. If he ate one while Dean sat across from him, would the man know that Castiel was thinking of him and his soft insides?
He leans in to press one last lingering kiss to Dean’s erection.
“Thanks, Cas.”
“I’ve been expelled from my vessel. I need your and Sam’s help.”
Yeah. Dean’s tears leak down into the collar of his shirt.
Content silence falls again. Castiel weighs the options on his next move, as the come drying on his stomach is rather uncomfortable, but his body still feels like melted caramel. Now he wants those little chocolates with caramel inside.
When his thrusts start to stutter, Dean clasps a hand across the back of his neck. “That’s it, Angel.”
When a few minutes have passed and Dean has collected himself enough to let out happy, little laughter sighs, the two look up at the stars together.
Dean wasn’t angry. Anger took too much energy. No, he was rotting. Sober and brittle like the type of branches you think can hold your weight when you’re a kid climbing trees, but the limb is hollow in the middle and it snaps clean off when you grab it, delivers you directly to the E.R.. Rotting, and he waits for the mushrooms to start sprouting from his skin.
When Sam pulls away, he looks between the two of them again and starts crowing. “Years! A decade! I had to watch you flirt, I had to sit in a car with you for hours and pretend I couldn’t hear you pining. I just-” Sam runs his hands through his ridiculously long hair. He proceeds to walk a lap around the table, leave the room, and then come back again.
Dean’s hands tighten around the ends of the armrests of the chair. “You might have to try again. I don’t think I got it the first time.” His voice is weak despite the bravado of the words.
Just when it almost feels too good, and the rough slide of Cas’s callouses have him on the brink of telling Cas to get a move on or they’re not gonna get to the final event, Cas’s hand stills. It grips almost painfully tight around the base of his cock, staving off the way Dean’s body was working itself up, and Dean outright moans. It’s loud and desperate where it echoes off of the concrete walls. He throws his head back into the resistance of the pillow under his head.
No.” Now it’s Sam’s turn to look annoyed. “I mean, most swans do mate for life, but it’s more of a successful egg-laying thing than a romantic thing. Besides, we’re not actually swans. I mean, think of all the people you’ve slept with, and you’ve never gotten on one knee for any of them.” Dean glares, but Sam continues unperturbed. “The wing thing basically just means that you like the person enough for it to rub off on your weird swan mannerisms.”
“I’m sorry.” It’s a sincere apology, a genuine sorry. Maybe like it hurts a little bit. “I shouldn’t have come here.”
And he is Cas, so he is loved.
Now, what to do with all of this information.
He wonders how the Swans don’t crumble under the weight of all of the gazes.
“Yeah, you’re not as slick as you think, Cas.”
Castiel enters the stall by stepping through the back wall of it, and is met with the familiar smell of cedar and the sugars of the honey being warmed by the day. There is twine laying out right where he left it, so he begins to tie it in bunny-eared knots around the jars. They line themselves up neatly for him like little toy soldiers.
Not this. Not that look that’s burned its way into Dean’s brain. His gut lurches, but Cas is already talking again.
Castiel passes a flat hand over it carefully. He pushes it down like petting, gently, until it lays pinned between Castiel’s palm and the softness of Dean’s stomach. The only tension in Dean’s body is where the blood-hardened shaft tries to right itself, but it is minuscule compared to the easy pressure Castiel presses it down with.
He watches Dean snuffle a sleepy noise while his lips come together before parting, this innocuous movement, and there it is again. The easiness of Dean’s expression stirs something in Castiel’s stomach. It warms in rings that blossom and confuse him further. Even with his infinite knowledge, his millennia of living, he doesn’t understand his own reaction to the stimuli.
“Right,” Finley says again, and then they both stop talking as she watches him darken the divots on Castiel’s face created by the fire’s glow on him.
He doesn’t know how to respond to that, so he elects to stay silent. When he approaches the table, he realizes there’s a large map across the top of it.
When Dean came to the next day feeling like a garbage disposal was eating away at his insides, Sam didn’t even bitch him out. He’d just set down a glass of water and a few pain relievers in front of Dean from over his shoulder. Sam had wrapped his tree trunk arms around Dean from behind, then, just for a second before pulling away.
Sam laughs a little, shakes his head as he casts a glance in Eileen’s direction. “To be honest with you, I sorta ask myself that question all the time.”
Ew. There’s air, like, on Dean’s asshole.
,” rustles from Dean. There is no force to move it where it leaks from his throat and into the air through an open mouth.
They draw in on where Cas and Charlie sit, sneaking up from the side so as to not be seen. This close, only a few feet off, they can hear the words being exchanged.
There are too many other gears grinding in this machine set on chewing Dean up and spitting him out on the other side while people cheer and pretend that the kisses they’re blowing at him aren’t actually arrows with heads sharp enough to kill.
Dean frowns, “Odd like sick?”
“Is this some sort of occasion I should have remembered?”
Dean grunts. “It sucks.”
Charlie looks up at him for the first time and smiles around the end of the brittle sound. “Oh, thank you, Mysterious and Dreamy Honey Vendor.”
“Dean.”
“That was rather ominous, wasn’t it? This isn’t a bad place to be a swan. Maybe complicated is a more accurate word. A little bit confusing as well. Maybe, if someone explains it to you, you’ll understand, and some of that burden will ease. I’d rather you didn’t have an identity crisis.”
But Cas doesn’t make him. Of course he doesn’t.
“About what?”
Castiel uses the hand on Dean’s shoulder to turn him around, and he moves willingly with the pressure. Still, Dean’s head is hung towards the ground like he doesn’t know how to meet Cas’s eyes.
“Yeah, yeah, alright, I’ll admit to that. It was actually the watching that gave me this idea. Last week, when we were in the Dean Cave, we watched that one video of A.L.B. and her wife. The one where she played with her hair? I guess I didn't realize that the whole ASMR thing was- I dunno- real? I thought, you know, it was something that’s just in videos. But when I realized I could do that for you actually? What kinda boyfriend would I be if I didn’t at least try?”
And Castiel has to pretend that life goes on as if his has not been irrevocably changed by a single meeting. Because Dean Winchester is already somebody to everybody. It does not matter that he is now somebody to Castiel. It does not matter that he listened to Castiel talk about honey.
A real, clumsy smile with teeth and one corner of his mouth ticked up. It fits that severe face so honestly. Dean doesn’t think he’s ever seen a more honest smile, a more pleased expression. More fondness.
Sam doesn’t wait for an answer before he looks to where Cas is standing. “Morning, Castiel. Got back into the honey butter?”
“Okay, okay, maybe not. But I promise, this is my brain we’re talking about, and I’m getting too old for this sneaking around shit. Everything feels good, Cas. It’s just… not as loud.”
“There has been true violence in his life,” Cas abruptly starts again and opens his eyes. “He is a fighter, a killer, ruthless when he needs to be. His very body is a weapon. But still, there is a part of him that has never known that cruelty.” And then Cas is reaching forward into the space between them, and Dean watches his hand grow closer like it’s in slow-motion. Until Cas’s fingers tap so fragilely against his chest through his thin-worn t-shirt that Dean only knows they’re there from sight and not the sensation of touch. “This muscle in his chest.”
“Yes, I- I infused it with honey from the Buckwheat apiary and then jarred it to sit for the last few days. Honey, in general, can be used as a moisturizer, and it’s very good for sensitive skin when it’s diluted.”
“I’m dreaming,” Cas breaks the silence to say, something sad in his voice that doesn’t belong there right now.
Dean breaks into goosebumps at the lyric, Taylor’s tone and the undercurrent of hurt it carries. It’s not his hurt but it’s mourning and apologetic and it gives him chills. Still, his eyes stay resolutely dry.
This time, Dean doesn’t try to deepen the kiss, his hands just tighten around Castiel’s hips. In some ways, it is so chaste it is barely a kiss at all, like two children pretending to be married. In so many other ways, though, who needs tongues and clicking teeth when there has never been anything as intimate as the mutual touching of mouths, all of those unprotected nerve endings bared but together.
“Thank you for letting me do that,” Castiel finally murmurs. He takes another calming inhale. “It was even more fulfilling than I thought it’d be.”
Castiel glares at him.
Dean recalls memories, thinks about Sammy and apple pie and Baby. Next, reluctantly, he nudges at the grief he knows is just below the surface. To his surprising relief, it’s still there. There’s still that tug in his chest for all of the people he’d lost, his gut still clenching at the thought of those days when Michael controlled his body. But it’s quieter. When the distress surfaces, it stays put instead of frantically trying to escape and winding Dean’s brain too tight.
Another moment of silence. “Is there… anything I can do?” Cas asks. He’s so good. He’s too good to Dean, when Dean is being such a little bitch even though Cas is just trying to help.
He leans down to Cas’s ear to whisper, “Mmm, you sound so sexy when you talk Old Western to me.”
Castiel squirms slightly against him. “Keep…” he trails off like he’s too sedated to finish the thought. Dean waits a beat, and finally, Cas concludes, “like that.”
A woman who wants to be twenty years younger than she is walks in with her lips done up in an unnatural shade of pink. She joins the drunk cheering men, kisses one of them on the cheek and leaves a neon print behind.
“Cas, I need you to touch me. I wanna… oh,” Dean breathes. “You make me feel so good.”
“Right?” Dean exclaims. “Kid’s got hops, I’ll tell you that. I’m just glad he could find a way to use his freakishly long limbs for good instead of evil. Did you see that diving save he made at Saturday’s game?” The girls nod back excitedly. “Man, I was yelling so loud I thought I was gonna burst something.”
Before Dean can explain that that’s really not what he meant at all, Cas is standing back up and shedding his pants and underwear. If there’s one thing that can be said for Dean, it’s that he never looks a gift horse in the mouth. Cas may have completely misunderstood what Dean was trying to get at, but at least he’s naked.
And Castiel wants to touch, wants to feel all of the solid lines of muscle that shift under Dean’s clothes. He cups a hand around the opposite side of Dean’s neck before trailing it downwards over the smooth bump of his pec. He can feel where Dean’s nipple has hardened under the shirt, and when he rubs his pinkie finger over it, Dean quakes beneath him.
“Jesus, okay, I’ll deal with him. I’ll-” Dean looks around before his gaze lands back on Cas again, the glowing moon of him that is very much not something he can explain away. “You need to hide. Like,
Anna’s frown deepens, and Castiel already knows what she’s thinking.
“Mornin’,” Dean croaks with a dry throat.
Dean can feel where Cas’s body stiffens, like he had expected Dean to just pretend none of it had ever happened. Dean gets that. But Dean isn’t the person he was two months ago.
The woman who owns the candle stall across the market’s dirt road, Madeline, is doing a demonstration on the process of candlemaking to attract potential customers. It seems to be working, as a small group has formed to watch as she repeatedly dunks the gradually forming candlestick into a bucket full of wax. Castiel’s happy that people are interested. Madeline is a kind woman who has helped both himself and Anna in their stall on multiple occasions, and during these summer months, she’ll buy honey from them to make her seasonal candles with.
“You watching porn without me?” Dean asks with his most charming smile and leans a little closer over the table.
His fingers drift in paths up and down the soft skin of the back of Dean’s neck so lightly that his touch is just a graze. To his surprise, Dean manages to bow his head even further over Castiel’s shoulder to bear more of his skin. So Castiel continues the ministration, drawing feather-light lines across the notch at the top of Dean’s spine, then further to the side against the strong tendon that connects from Dean’s ear to his clavicle.
“Exactly,” Dean grins.
Sometimes, he gets jealous of how easy it seems for Cas to be so transparent about it. He purses his lips, and there’s only one more column of shaving cream on his neck to go over.
“What?!” Dean stands abruptly enough that he stoves his knees again. “Goddammit.”
“Gross!” he complains loudly and slaps her arm. “Ew. She was, like, in her sixties.”
Dean doesn’t know how Cas manages to make the words sound like both a compliment and a threat. And the things Cas had said to him the last time they parted suddenly start to form a clearer picture, a puzzle full of pieces Dean never understood until now.
The market’s closed and deserted state was in part due to the monthly town bonfire in the center square. An event that gave children the excuse to stay up past their bedtime and for their parents to get woefully drunk. It wasn’t necessarily Castiel’s idea of fun. He had offered to take care of a last-minute check on the Buckwheat apiary so that Anna could attend, though, which had led to his current late night trek back to town in the chill of the night.
Dean startles back, and Sam stops talking, looks between the two of them in disbelief. Taylor continues to croon.
Dean stares at him. “What aren’t you telling me?”
That actually makes Castiel pause. Does he want to act on it? Is there even anything to act on? Certainly, the separate components of why Castiel wants, as confusing as they are, are there. But maybe they are just that: components. Maybe they are puzzle pieces to an idea that never becomes assembled. Maybe they sit in their box and collect dust.
Alright. Okay. Dean can get on board with this.
Eileen smiles. “I feel like I need to take a nap. You’re a natural.” She looks a little sad underneath, though. Dean wonders if she’s as disappointed as he feels that their little spa day is coming to an end. It’s like he’s a little kid, or what little kids were supposed to act like, anyway.
I’ve lost. Hell, my relationship with my dad.” Dean gives a dry laugh, wipes his cold palms on the thighs of his jeans even though they’re not sweating. “Like everything finally got quiet enough out there that it got loud again up here.” He taps a finger on his temple. He doesn’t even know where his words were coming from, just that they’re true, feel good to say. He wonders if Cas has something to do with that.
And for some reason, that’s what gets Cas flustered. His eyes dart around, and there’s a happy little blush on his cheeks. “No, I suppose that’s alright.” He smiles down softly at his chest, and it makes Dean feel like he’s cracking in half, that he put that look on Cas’s face.
“You-” Cas pants, eyebrows drawn together against some big emotion.
“So which ones are these?” Dean looks back up to ask.
“Touch me, Cas.”
“We’ve all been going to the frisbee matches a lot,” Alex says candidly. “Sam’s doing great this season.”
No one, Castiel thinks, not just a stranger. No one is ever in my space. No one looks at me or touches me because I am alone. Your touch is not unwelcome, it is simply unheard of.
It gets a little easier to say it, and Dean feels less and less like he has to pretend.
Dean groans quietly in his ear, stroking Castiel’s low belly. “Well, that’s real nice, Cas. All for little old me, huh?”
Dean’s spindling fingers wander to the sides of Cas’s neck and then back to center over the bump of his Adam’s apple. He circles it, drawing patterns out from it like rays of sunshine over Cas’s warm skin.
It’s snug up against some grapes, two peaches, and one lone banana. How Dean managed to get the banana right on the first try and not the apple is a mystery to him. Just further proof that he needs the practice. He presses his charcoal against the paper to deepen the shadow between the apple and the grapes, but he thinks that might actually be worse. Dean resists the urge to bang his head back on the tree he’s leaning up against.
He’s so lost in it that at first, he doesn’t realize that Dean is still touching him. Castiel is starting to soften, his skin hypersensitive against the friction of Dean’s fingertips. A pang runs up his spine. “What-” He starts with a gasp.
Dean looks at the jar, then at Castiel, then at the wall behind him, before his eyes lock with Castiel’s again.
“Castiel!” he hears called at him by a familiarly distinct and feminine voice. He can’t seem to place it though, for a second, before he realizes it’s the voice of Eileen Leahy. For the first time that day, a genuine smile spreads onto Castiel’s face.
“Like something you’d see in
However, Dean still doesn’t seem inclined to do much more than observe, so Castiel continues his washing. Moving the rag down from Dean’s chest in a line to his pubic hair, before wrapping delicately around his soft cock. It only takes one pass of the cloth to remove the come, and then Castiel is moving equally as cautiously against his perineum and tender hole. But there’s only so much he can do with what’s still inside, so he finally uses his grace to clear away the rest.
“About what?” Dean asks around his bite of pie, deliberately playing stupid.
like me?”
All Castiel can do is lean forward and kiss him again. He’s burning up under his skin, and the lazy way that Dean kisses him now that he’s come is almost more erotic. Dean licks into his mouth like he’s chasing the taste of his own orgasm. Castiel opens his mouth wider to it, feeling unhinged.
“Cas,” Dean hisses, “Cas, that ain’t gonna work. Just- just-” his eyes scan the area frantically, landing on Jimmy’s still slumped body. But that’s the whole problem in the first place, isn’t it? That Cas can’t get back in. So where- Dean’s eyes look down the line of his own body with sudden inspiration. “Get over here!”
No. Castiel is not so sure how to feel at all.
What if Dean were here? Would he like it? Would he enjoy the peace of this place as much as Castiel, until they were so peaceful together that each other’s company would be somehow even more serene than solidarity could be?
Reaching an unsure hand upwards to hover above Dean’s face, Castiel murmurs, “I’m going to shut your eyes,” and it almost comes out like a question even though he doesn’t mean it to.
Sure enough, when Dean looks over at the neighboring house about a dozen yards off through the window that he knows leads into the kitchen, Eileen is peering out. She waves when she realizes he’s looking at her and he waves back much more happily than he would have if it were Sam looking out at him.
Eileen looks at Dean like
“Pleasant,” Dean repeats back plainly.
“Do we do this often?” Castiel asks, secretly hoping that the answer is yes.
Things are still delightfully new and nerve-wracking between them, even at the same time that Castiel has never felt more at peace around another person. Dean makes him feel so welcome inside of his own skin. And yet, now, he’s not sure if he should say the things that want to bubble out. He and Dean kiss and they tentatively hold hands and they both seem to want the same things while they’re both too anxious to ask the other.
“Unexpected,” he responds, and for some reason it makes Sam laugh. Castiel enjoys Sam’s laughter. He wonders what Dean’s sounds like.
Sam is the first one to speak. “You don’t have to thank us for anything, Cas. I know you don’t remember right now, but you really are our family. And we’re glad you’re here with us.” His tone is gentle and sincere.
“First, you got your flour, F-L-O-U-R, which you need two cups of.” He writes out
“So you’re saying what you sound like right now, that’s you? That’s your real voice?”
To his surprise, Cas says, “Nowhere at all,” in a contented way that Dean hasn’t heard in a very long time. Silence falls again, and Cas goes back to reading his book.
Castiel shrugs in a way that is so oddly casual that it reminds Dean of how far they’ve come since the beginning. “Both, I suppose. It is… overwhelming to hear something like this and even begin to think that is how you feel about me.”
There’s a beat before Cas answers with an affronted, “Alright.”
And Cas looks just as intrigued, leans closer over the table. “That’s the strangest part, Dean. No one knows why it happens. How could something as simple as someone whispering create subconscious physical sensation?”
Dean follows not too far behind him but makes his way in the opposite direction around the massive pit of the fire. And, yes, there, red hair glinting on the head of the shortest person Dean has ever met. Even further down in eyesight, because Rowena is sitting on one of the wooden benches watching the fire.
“You’re in me-” Dean leans away to say, guttural. Cas’s cheeks are the prettiest ruddy pink. Bright eyes in the dark blinking out through warm brown eyelashes like sleeping blankets, and they see Dean. And they see him. “God- I- I love you.”
At Castiel’s calming words, Dean’s soul circles before it settles, like a dog finding the perfect spot to nap. And with it, Castiel watches with wonder as Dean’s eyes grow even hazier, blanker, as if he has truly given up the urge to fight and sunk back into the cloud that is his body.
“Well, look at the universe now, better off with you in it, buddy,” Dean says only half teasingly.
. And then he’s looking away like- what, like he’s embarrassed Dean caught him? As if about fifty percent of the crowd here isn’t also staring at Dean without shame.
Taylor sings from the speaker,
It takes all of his effort to open his heavy mouth. “Yeah,” he finally manages, “I can hear you, Cas.”
She’s explaining to Cas how she made them, signing quickly while she speaks quietly, and Dean smiles to himself at how Cas watches her with great focus as to not miss anything.
“Unarguably,” Cas replies seriously.
And Eileen laughs from where she’s watching all of their mouths move. Actually laughs. Dean isn’t friends with her anymore.
Dean actually whimpers, his eyes snapping shut, and his legs shuffling uselessly. “Yeah,” he pants, and then Cas’s hand is moving faster, collecting precome at the top of the movement and bringing it back down again. “Yeah, yeah, yeah,” and it grows in pitch, in volume, through a clenched jaw.
Castiel lets the joy burn through him, the smile on his face that he couldn’t tamp down even if he tried. He grabs Dean’s wrist from his chest, uses it to bring his hand to his mouth. Castiel kisses Dean’s knuckles, his fingers, through the frankly disgusting mess still on them.
“I do.” Dean leans his cheek further into Cas’s palm. “Easy. I’ll teach you.”
he wants to ask.
Castiel weeps as he comes inside of Dean’s body. His hips jerk through it, minute movements that barely even jostle Dean, because Castiel refuses to pull out, pull away. He’s trembling all over. Each of his exhales has a strung-out cry on them. He pulses and feels his own release become slick within Dean.
The only response he gets is the clicking of metal pieces slotting back into place.
“It’s Cas’s miracle juice!” Dean exclaims and wipes the lingering tears from his eyes. “Ever since I was touched by an angel, I’ve been worse than a divorced lady binging Oprah.”
“And my brain just runs itself in circles, man, like it won’t turn off. I haven’t been sleeping very well.” Dean finishes lamely, suddenly wishing he’d never said anything at all and had just gone inside for hot chocolate.
And this time, instead of Cas meeting him with knowing words, he falters. “I don’t understand.” Cas sounds embarrassed by it, like he thinks he should inexplicably know what Dean means or that he’s somehow missed something. It’s not right at all. Because Dean can feel the way the energy in the air moves when Cas retracts into himself. Of all the things that Dean wants, that isn’t one of them.
Cas stares down into the bowl. “You can tell me if you think it’s- odd.”
“Something wrong?” Cas mimics Dean’s own words back to him almost coldly.
Dean can’t keep laying here in this obnoxiously silent house. So he scrubs his hands over his face and wipes at his messy nose, clears his throat and pretends that his own existence isn’t painful right now.
And Dean almost wants to take that out, just because of how much of a
He presses his lips together and tries to collect himself. Focuses on the feel of Dean’s soft hair between his fingers. “Shhh,” he hushes even as his own voice shakes and his own hands tremble. “Sh-shhh, Dean. It’s just me. It’s Castiel. There’s no reason to worry at all. Go- go back to sleep now.”
“Yes, that’s it. Just like that. Let me hear, Dean, how good you feel. You’re so lovely. I’m leaking in my boxers just listening to the noises you make. You can’t understand how satisfied I am knowing that you feel good.”
He squeezes his eyes shut and tries, curses at himself when it doesn’t work. It is like getting a taste of Greek Thyme Honey, the most wonderful and expensive thing you have ever consumed, and then being told you can never have it again. Until you wished you had never even tried it in the first place so that you would never know what you were missing.
“There’s… something I’ve been planning on surprising you with,” Cas says hesitantly. He looks away from Dean’s eyes, back up again.
It becomes a categorization of all of Dean’s softness, of every scar, where Dean is somehow, impossibly, still whole. And he remains unmoving, even under Castiel’s ministrations. He just breathes on evenly and blinks every few seconds. But Dean’s soul is melted without a trace of its usual scaliness, so Castiel continues his task.
He’s not sure if the vow is for Castiel’s sake or his own.
He could be twitching, or he could be loose and relaxed. He's not really sure from this perspective.
“I’m serious,” Dean says, and maybe he really is annoyed.
And Dean doesn’t even know when, but somewhere along the line he really started to get into this. It itches the same part of his brain that movies do, that LARPing does, a fun little escape full of stories that make people happy. He can hear his own excitement in his tone, though it stays as quiet as when he started.
Well, jokes on you, maybe-Mandy, because Dean’s getting piped on about seven different planes of existence by a devastatingly handsome archangel who is also his boyfriend now, thank you very much.
Cas is in there. Dean just knows it this time.
He is hot everywhere. Dean’s hip is solid against his erection. It is Dean’s hip. Castiel’s toes curl in his boots.
“Color-coded…” Dean mumbles to himself while he pokes at where the sticks have different colors at their tips. There’s a woven bracelet with a bead through it on his wrist, and a thick silver band adorning his ring finger. “Nice.”
The headphones are connected to Cas’s actual phone, which is turned horizontally in his hands like he’s watching a video. Does Cas even know how to watch videos on his phone? Whatever he’s looking at has him absorbed because he doesn’t even acknowledge Dean’s presence until Dean sits down across from him.
“Dude, that’s- that’s kinda awesome. Freaky, but awesome.”
Anna had returned a few hours ago and asked if anything interesting had happened. Castiel hadn’t known whether to tell her or not. He wasn’t trying to hide it, exactly, because he was sure that the rumor mill would hit her ears about it by tomorrow anyway. But he also didn’t even know where to start, how to form words around it, that compact little moment between Dean and him. How pathetically much it meant.
“Do you remember what I told you I wanted to do to you?”
Dean isn’t sure if this is about to be the stupidest thing he’s ever done or the smartest. He’s so nervous he might actually puke though.
.” Dean gapes at him. “A little warning?”
Cas strokes him through it, all the way to the other side where Dean is a shamble of bones and twitching muscles that slump down onto Cas’s chest.
And he’s hit with it again, the same realization he had at the apiary when Cas had been so furious at him that he’d shaken him by the fabric of his shirt. Castiel is not some meek thing. He’s wary and quiet sometimes, but he’s immovable in others. The idea that Dean would have to protect him is suddenly almost ludicrous. All that power, the genuine heartstopping resolution to him. This severe man.
The smile on Cas’s face drops back into a frown, and he looks decidedly unhappy about the change in conversation.
“Is it okay if I touch your neck?” he asks, and he barely recognizes his own voice, how soft it is even though he knows Eileen can’t hear it.
“Mostly… birds.”
Sam stoops to hug him from the awkward angle, uses his massive hands to cradle Dean’s head to his chest, and Dean doesn’t cry even though that’s all he feels like doing.
“Oh.” Suddenly, Dean feels like a child. His tired eyes are wet and irritated. “Right.”
Sam scoffs a disbelieving laugh, eyebrows to his hairline. He looks at Castiel, who can still feel the tears drying on his cheeks, then to Dean. Castiel can’t see Dean’s face from this angle, but whatever Sam observes there makes his surprised smile turn gloomy. In the blink of an eye, his long legs carry him across the room, around the table, to Castiel’s unoccupied side.
“Samuel!” Rowena calls through the speaker. “To what do I owe this pleasure?”
Something like horror paints Dean’s expression. “You ever-” he clears his throat- “You remember hugs, don’t you?” Pleading.
When they round on the window, Cas is a picture framed through its white trim. He’s sitting on a stool at the small ledge that protrudes from the right wall, at Dean’s left, and acts as a sort of table for Castiel to work at. It’s lined with jars that Cas appears to be labeling, as well as all of the supplies he needs to do so, a mess of scissors, twine, and pink paint.
“Agreed.”
“Let’s get this tour rolling, then. You should have time to shower before dinner if you want to.”
This. This, it’s too close to me. I want-” Dean tries again, wobbly. “Cas, you mean too much to me for me to fuck this up. But it’s so goddamn frustrating. Because I want you to love me…  not like you love Sam. But I can’t-” Dean groans with agitation, runs a clawed hand through his hair sharply.
He’s grateful to be holed up in this corner where no one pays them any attention because the LSU game is in the fourth quarter and the bartender is busy mixing the drinks that one drunk table bought for the other.
Dean can feel where his eyes are watering, and he clenches his jaw against it. He doesn’t tell Sam to stop. Cas was Sam’s friend, too, just in a different way. A very different way. It’s nice to hear Cas’s name out loud.
Cas lets out a deep sigh. He has stopped eating his lunch. He looks rattled like this, while the humidity in the air that warns of an oncoming storm makes Cas’s hair frizz. Dean would be frowning if he could.
Dean rolls his eyes. “Alright, Mr. Humble, not all of us have balls of steel. Now,” Dean walks the few feet to the bed and climbs up onto it, sits so that he’s leaning back against the headboard while his legs are criss-cross applesauce under him. Criss-cross applesauce. Nice. “Get your humble ass over here and put your inflated head in my lap.”
like it.” Castiel doesn’t know how to respond to that either, but Dean takes his silence as confirmation. “So, what, do you jerk off while I’m out?”
“Yes,” Castiel blazes, “your heart. The things it does outside of moving blood.”
The crickets hiding in those lilies, once chirping loudly, grow quiet as he walks up the two steps of the front porch. When he reaches the door he rings the doorbell like always, even though, like always, Jody told him he never has to. Dean can hear a pair of footsteps approaching the door from the other side before it swings open to reveal Jody’s warm face that he has to look down to see with the handful of inches he has on her. The lamplight from the living room at her back glows out onto the porch.
Dean lights up real quick with a gasp. Then Cas does it again. “Cas-”
Dean nods, smacks his lips together, and gives Castiel a winning grin that’s all teeth. It’s an interesting expression when paired with his nudity. “As I’ll ever be, SandMan.”
Things that should make sense don’t, flit in and out Castiel’s head with fervor. “Earlier today, you referred to me as Cas. Why?”
“Touch me, Cas.”
If Cas is surprised by his request it doesn’t show on his face. His hands come up to cradle Dean’s cheeks and he kisses him gently, like a thank you. “Of course,” Cas whispers as he pulls back.
It’s an odd and jarring sort of understanding that slots into place against the very comfortable beliefs that Dean’s been living with. And that’s it, isn’t it? Dean got too comfortable about it all, this angel stuff, this otherworldly creature that sometimes sits across from him in his kitchen when he’s making dinner. Dinner that this creature doesn’t eat.
The swan, of course, says nothing.
The wires in Castiel’s brain cross, cross, short circuit under the pressure. Whirring and drawn out like the dashed white lines flying past outside the window. He doesn’t understand.
“Yes, actually, Anna is running the stall for the time being so that I could come see Gabriel. I haven’t been able to attend a single game yet this season, and even I realize that most likely makes me a bad brother. Especially when they’re doing so well.” He sighs.
Cas gapes at him like he is seeing Dean for the first time. This blooming, this parting of clouds. It makes Dean’s stomach writhe in the wonderful, previously unknown anticipation of love. Dean kisses Cas’s wrist again.
But Dean is already walking down the hallway towards the garage. He calls over his shoulder, “You don’t have to give me the talk, Sammy, I know all about the birds
Castiel’s hand throbs from the impact. Dean is clutching his face and staring at Castiel with wounded disbelief that for some reason only makes Castiel angrier. How dare he? How dare he make excuses and want pity? This whole time he had known, every time he had seen Castiel at the market with a new secret learned, a new fear or fact that Castiel had thought he was confiding to a dumb fucking animal. But Dean had been- this whole time-
Dean is watching Castiel pointedly, but eventually nods. “Sam’s right. You’re our family, and we take care of our family, period. And I don’t make my World Famous Pancakes for just anyone.” With that, he turns back to the stove and cracks another egg into the pan.
Cas’s hands move up further, putting pressure in the soft flesh that gives just below the solidity of Dean’s skull. It feels good, and Dean finds himself sighing against his own volition. Of course, Cas notices, because he redoubles his efforts on the area. His fingers are deft and succinct, lingering only as long as they’re welcome before pulling away to move to the next spot.
And Dean thinks back to that hostess all those years ago, and how he wished she would’ve known what was going through his head enough to say, “It’s alright, you can look at me,” so that he wouldn’t feel so bad about staring. Until he couldn’t even risk glancing her way because it felt like he’d never be able to take his eyes off of her.
hell do you think you’re doing?”
“Dean! Dean!” It sounds like a girl, someone young, and it’s the only reason that Dean’s hackles don’t immediately raise again under the tension he’s holding in his body. Still, he considers just ignoring whoever it is until they call his name again more forcefully. When he stops, Charlie stops with him. Together they turn towards the sound of rapidly approaching footsteps.
. He’s the reason you were asking me all those questions! About your wings! Dude!”
It is a Thursday, but Castiel begs off of working at the stall to go to the Linden apiary anyway. Anna gives him an odd look, but she doesn’t ask him any questions as he gathers up his toolbox and slips out of the stall’s back door.
The urge to soothe is so deep. It’s always been about the soothing, the protecting, the taking care of Dean and knowing that Dean craves that care in return. Because even though the man is hesitant to admit it, it is never lost on Castiel the way he moans when spoken sweetly to.
The swan in front of him doesn’t even turn in his direction. Oh yes, Castiel feels particularly stupid.
“Nuh-uh, nope, this is the most interesting thing to happen to me this week. Cas is, like, the best. He even learned some sign language so that he could talk to Eileen when she goes to get her honey. Not to mention he gives me a little honey stick every time I go with her.”
Maybe that was a sad though, but he always knew his brother would be fine without him. Hell, he was probably
His nightmares always started the same, but after each night more and more just added on to it.
But he couldn’t look away, or else it could disappear. And he didn’t want that, not after thinking he would never be able to see Cas again.
. It was the Bunker's door (and the whole outside of the bunker too for that matter, but only if you focused on it. Probably something about the weird physics in Heaven), the one place that would always be home to him.
He prayed.
how he probably looked, he could feel the sweat and the cold on him- “Oh god, we have to get you out of here, t-to a hospital.”
“Jus’ do i’ fas’.”
Which meant that beneath every happy moment Sam should have had in his long life with Eileen, a part of him had never moved past Deans death, a thought that was as heartbreaking as it was it was joyful. Because no matter how long Sam lived without Dean, he would never be the same as when he was with his brother, his life had never been the same.
went through his mind before being blown away by the pain.
He only made a sharp intake of breath through his nose in surprise before he closed his eyes and kissed the angel back, pulling him closer by gripping his hair to make the angle better, while Cas pulled him in by the hand that was now on his waist and the one gripping his shoulder.
without him. Because if Dean had never shown up in his apartment that night, maybe Sam would never had gone back in the life the way he did. All that pain and destruction that came along with the simple goal of finding their father.
This time Dean didn’t hesitate.
But everything was different. Sammy wasn’t just his kid brother anymore, the way he held himself and the way he spoke told him that this soul didn’t belong to his almost-forty-year-old brother, this soul belonged to a man who had lived his life.
And Chuck.
A simple: “Tell me it’s okay,” because he never could have done it without knowing for certain that it was.
. And now there was only one question left in his mind.
And without even thinking about it, without even being aware of it, he did what he had always done whenever he used to have a nightmare this bad.
A deep groan escaped his throat, “Am I dead?”
And now, Dean’s heaven
His brother probably heard the slight panic in his voice, since he was quick to land a heard enough punch to stun the vampire for a few seconds, long enough to come close enough to check the damage himself.
She straightened up proudly and held her lasso with a firm grip.
He hated Ash, not because he lacked any feeling of love strictly speaking, but in his mind, Ash didn’t fit the shoes of the ideal son for his beloved niece.
She smiled. He turned at Jewel.
« Will you be there? » he was now begging.
« Dean? » she called as she stepped inside the room.
"These are adult issues, sweetie".
« I’m going nuts... I gotta go to sleep, I’m hallucinating... I’m hearing voices»
Chadwick and Jewel had made a promise to stick to just that when they came back from Bobby’s.
In the meantime, Dean trotted throughout the paddock, his boots scraping on the ground..... He took off his hat and hit the back of the animal to make it trot faster.
It seems that you are dying.
"Hey, Cass," Dean says, insecure.
« What are you gonna do, Aunt Jo? » Jewel asked.
Dean felt a twinge… He smiled but his eyes were filled with doubts.
Castiel dropped a message to Madison to confirm their lunch on Saturday.
« Me and my buddy, we don’t like faggots »
"Huh? " he was staring at her.
« Sure. And please don’t burn it this time... While you cook, I’m gonna reward myself with a handy jay and I’ll be right back. All this has inspired me » he walked out of the kitchen.
« Help me God » Dean abruptly interrupted him, raising his hands. « If it were up to me, I’d skip that part. » he added, sipping his coffee.
He had heard that so particular voice and above all, he had crossed the most extraordinary eyes he had ever seen.
« Have fun »
« Kate » Dean’s voice was a rumble and he looked around him, feeling uncomfortable.
« I’ve known Castiel for almost eight years and I can assure you he’s completely crazy about his Dean and this stupid hetero jerk is equally mad about his gay roommate » he said, raising his voice.
« No, Jewel… And stand up straight. Stop whining, you’re a big girl now … » Madame Fournier’s tone was as cold as ice.
Castiel was a cultivated person but not like Dean who was a cinema buff ... He preferred books. However, he was making the effort, just for the kids, of one movie session per month and each time, he surprisingly came home rarely disappointed ... While he admired the technical aspects of the movie, the children were fascinated by the story and the characters ... Everyone was happy, in the end.
« Certain » he patted his arm.
He asks the carnie to exchange it. The man rolls his eyes, takes back the bottle and hands him a mini minion.
« I’ll be pleased to teach you how to ride» he smiled, as Dean had been reacting to his previous remark.
"I was just thinking... You know ! Where he was? What he was doing? " Sam says distractedly, staring at his cup.
For the last two days, he had hardly eaten anything, fear and anxiety had filled his soul.
« Do you have pancakes ? » she asked, resting her chin in the palm of her hand, her elbow leaning on the armrest, which seemed to be a typical posture of hers.
They had talked, she said she understood, she said their love was real, that it was just a little different. All love stories have their unique nature, right?
« Mister Dean might have several broken bones, but all he cares about is winning that damn challenge » Castiel grumbled, putting his hat back on his head.
« Hi Cass » he said in a hoarse voice.
« Over there » Jewel said, totally exited, pointing at the TV corner.
For the record, Elyrian is also a writer of original characters and hopes to publish her first novel next year…in French. If you wish to get in touch with her, please PM me.
« Daddy ! » she reached up to her father again.
« Balty, please! » Castiel sighed, observing his companion’s outfit in detail.
Dean grumbled and started to rebuild the whole thing.
« Could you get dressed before coming out ?» Dean snapped, staring wide-eyed.
« Thanks »
« Why don’t you do the same on you ? »
« Dean »
Thank you again to be there
« I didn’t even have time to eat » Dean complained, pointing at his plate.
« Two months ?! » Both children let out a simultaneous long and profound sigh.
« I know the place » Garth stared at him and smiled.
« Are you kidding? » Dean was worried as he looked through the window. « My poor baby lying in the snow and the cold... I can say bye-bye to the battery » he added with a sad look.
He looked at Castiel who wasn’t smiling anymore.
This is how he just lost his sons.
" Of course, I am… I’ll just grow a wonderful bruise...Some battle scars ! " he laughed.
« We’re gonna be great dog owners. »
The fifth wheel… He shook his head and frowned at the idea that had suddenly crossed his mind.
« You deserve that too » Chadwick sighed, raising his eyes.
"Mirror of my soul ", whispers Castiel touching his reflection.
"It was their idea ..."
He suddenly wondered how he had to consider him from now on ? It still was Castiel, his friend. The same Castiel the kids considered as a second father. But now he was also Castiel, his lover.
He's already lost his bloodline family. Castiel refuses to lose his adopted one because of his sexual orientation.
"I really suggest you to shut up, Sammy," loudly.
here we are : the end of this story.
« I don’t wanna lose you » he said, palming Castiel’s cheeks in a gesture of panic.
« Well well, who do we have here? » his lips stretched in a nasty grin.
I wanted first and foremost to apologize for the delay in publication but you must know that my translator is going to be hospitalized for surgery shoulder next week. Despite the pain, she wanted to translate this chapter before getting operated, I want to thank her from the bottom of my heart.
« I don’t know whether he’ll take the plunge one day, I don’t know the guy and I’m not gay nor bi : therefore I can’t judge this kind of situation... So, maybe he’s unable to love you that way because he’s stuck with physical principles dating back to the Middle Ages – and I’m sure that back then… well, whatever» she pulled a face and resumed «...but I just can’t believe this kiss didn’t mean anything for him… He’s afraid to lose you because he loves you, it’s as simple as that... And this kiss, however chaste it was, came from him, not you... It wasn’t a cry of despair, Castiel, it was a cry from the heart »
« And this little beauty here must be Jewel » he declaimed as he kissed her little hand.
« Thanks for staying with me, Bobby » he briefly hugged the man and patted him in the back.
Bobby had set the table for desert and Jo had put some order in the living room.
Here they were, glaring at each other almost as strangers.... He didn’t pay attention to his mother’s old friends present as each year and who were obviously ignoring him, displaying a polite behavior because it only was politically correct.
" I acted like a moron " he felt so unfomfortable.
Dean looks like a deer caught in headlights.
There is no domination game between them, there never was, even the first time. Just a look, enough to know who needs the other and Dean likes this intimate trust, he needs it.
Dean stepped out of the car. The kids and Castiel walked at his side.
"Told about what, Sammy?" Dean snaps.
Castiel smiled... His so ordinary family.
« Yes, Pa’ » Chadwick said from a distance.
Castiel avoided the hit. However the bucket fell on one of Mrs Crowley’s garden gnomes and blew its head off.
« This young man isn’t managing the budget » Dean immediately snapped back.
« Here… Don’t open them before midnight» he said, raising an eyebrow.
The latter took him out of his torpor.
« You’re gonna pay for this » He put his hand/paw on his daughter’s head.
At that precise moment, Chadwick came back with the dog… He stood at the kitchen door and observed them.
Suddenly his heart ached at the idea Castiel would never come back.
So instead, he started to write.
« Yes »
« You’re mad at me, aren’t you ? I know I tricked you in front of the kids… I should have talked to you before, but when Byron made me that offer this morning, I admit I got a bit carried away»
"I'm not hungry anymore," Sam closes his computer, crossly and leaves the room.
He knew he could talk to her, tell her everything, but the words somehow stayed stuck in his throat.
« Don’t stop, please… Don’t stop »
"We'll talk about it when we get home."
Jo smiled when she received her own present which she opened with a frowning face.
"Would you mind speaking in a language known to mortals, Benny ?" Dean replies, on edge.
" I’d like to bring a little something for the kids. Any idea what would please them ? "
« Sorry » Dean sunk in his chair and pushed his plate away in front of him.
« It’s magnificent »
« Did I miss something ? » Bobby asked, feeling a bit worried.
« No... The garage »
The door had opened at that precise moment.
Dean’s face went pale.
« Why have I done this, dammit? » he whispered, filled with regret of having given that kiss which had generated so many contradictions in his mind.
« But Castiel… »
The Christmas tree was on. All characters were now in the crib. Christmas Day started.
« Are you sure?» Dean leaned forward and kissed him.
« Hi Babe » he said, putting a soft kiss on his lips, as he took off his jacket.
« Empty your mind… Let me take care of you. » his fingers softly running down his bare chest, making his skin shiver all over. He tenderly kissed his lips while unbuckling his belt. Dean tensed up when he felt Castiel’s fingers.
Dean moaned and fell back on the bed.
« It’ll only take a few minutes, Dean... Go and take the dog for a walk or else he’ll turn the entrance into Yellowstone Lake » he said, pointing at Apache sitting in front of the door.
« I know, Dean... » he said, raising a hand and gently rubbing his cheek. « You will never lose me ».
« Hi Deano » his nose was reddened by the cold and his eyes were shining.
« My apologies… I’ve always had trouble with this kind of references.»
« Oh God, it’s freezing » he said as he started to swim.
« Since when do you need an invitation? And watch your mouth, will you? Or I could start telling stories about you which you wouldn’t be proud of… SPIDER IN THE HOLE! »
« I’m not sure it will help seeing you two hungrily kissing each other, but in any case, they got prepared to the possibility» she said with a big laugh.
The stolen breath ... A furtive kiss.
« I didn’t have the time to pick up something else »
« Because there’s no place for anyone else in here. Because in their hearts, there’s only a place for you and Castiel… Castiel and you… and nobody else »
" Cass ? " Dean looked worried.
Chadwick stroked the dog as he was looking at them.
« Pleased to meet you » he let go of his hand.
And here he was again, grumbling like hell. He had barely managed to plant two pegs of the tent he was supposed to share with his children.
« We would go faster if we took the escalators. » Dean was grouching in front of the small crowd gathered by the elevators doors.
« I’m dog tired. This trip drained me. »
« Don’t you even think of going there, okay! » Dean snapped back, laying aside his plate on the fireplace mantle.
