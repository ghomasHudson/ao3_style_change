He’d thought that purging John out of his life would be conducive to the Work, and the attempt had been disastrous. So, he started self-medicating, then there were the men—by-products of John. In fact, he was due to see one that very evening. Only then could he think again, could function, even if not at one-hundred percent.
Sherlock smiled wickedly and turned to a woman in a gossamer ruby dress that fell to the tops of her knees. She was beautiful, long dark hair and bangs that framed chocolate, almond eyes. “Aimi Moto, born Ichiro Moto, quite famously known as being the first transgendered neurosurgeon. She's having an affair with the gentleman with the horrid hair plugs,” Sherlock tipped his regal head at a man in another group debating pugnaciously with a younger male. He had a Bill Nye-esque appeal, though he was a bit thick around the middle. “He hasn't told his wife that he has a fetish for breasts and cock,” he said, the ‘ck' a resonant click at the back of his throat.
The suit was a bright navy three-piece wonder trimmed in beige silk, with neat, barely perceptible hand stitched embroidery on the lapel. The shawl collared waistcoat was the same striking blue as the suit and trousers with three smooth, silver buttons clasped tightly over his abdomen. The tie was complete cheek; a knitted, beige item that cut off neatly beneath the waistcoat. To top it off, Victor had afforded John no extra cloth than what was necessary. It all fit terribly close.
"Apt conclusion, Mrs Hudson. There may be hope for humanity yet," Sherlock said dryly, before walking out the door, which Mrs Hudson opened for him and closed as he walked down Baker Street pushing, of all things, a pram.
"Greg Lestrade," the man returned kindly, "Finally went for it, did she? Good on her. Eh, is your boss around?"
For a moment, John could only stand there like a fool, weighing the pros and cons of getting into that vehicle with a man who wanted nothing more than to make him disappear.
For the second time in John's life, everything else around him seemed to stop for them. It was like being on a carousel. It was him and Sherlock, and life kept going around them, but it was all an irrelevant blur. In his peripheral, Jasper smiled wistfully down at the table, but he didn't say a word as Sherlock approached.
Of course John was correct, but Sherlock knew his brother well enough to know that he was pulling every string imaginable to make John disappear efficiently and effortlessly. Sherlock loathed him all the more for it. For now, though, there was nothing for it but to say goodbye while he still had the chance.
"John's hungry," Sherlock stated, rolling his eyes as Mrs Hudson's eyebrow raised smartly. "Yes, I know. Not my housekeeper, but surely you wouldn't allow John to starve."
The foyer was sparsely occupied, save for a few couples slobbering over one another and a man he was certain was cheating on his husband with one of the drag queens. He lingered there for a time, observing the other club patrons and deducing them savagely in his mind, before he passed through the entrance and into the cool night air, pulling his cigarette pack and lighter from his pocket.
John turned his head to face him, blinking into the dark as his eyes readjusted to Sherlock’s proximity. Slowly, he smiled and Sherlock returned it, something giddy and unfamiliar swelling inside of him.
Not to say that he wasn't happy for his friends. Greg didn't know much about John and Sherlock's history, just that they’d known one another since ankle-biters, but John had gotten Sherlock through a bad time in his life, and likewise. Strife had formed a strong bond between them, and Greg couldn't fault his friends for that.
His mobile pinged once again, and John couldn't be arsed to care how eager he appeared as he unlocked his screen to read the newest message.
“Well, with the way he looks at you, I'd say he wasn't far off,” Irene murmured, watching John apply a shell pink colour to his eyelids. He was going for the blushing virgin look paired with the Marilyn Monroe wig. “And the way you look at him…”
Holmes was close enough to hear. His eyes rose from John’s parted lips, to his eyes, and back again, the corners of his mouth pulling up into a lascivious smile.
John pulled off, forcing back a gag as he took more than he could handle, his chest heaving against Sherlock's inner thighs.
Sherlock only chuckled lightly on the other end, and John found himself boiling at the sound, not at all amused. "Don't be like that. My brother, in addition to having a share of my company, also holds a minor position in the government. It is merely his way of taking precautions."
“Sherlock,” said the man amiably, his expression open and happy, “so very good to see you, my friend.” The man took Sherlock's hand between both of his and shook it reverently, with which Sherlock only looked a bit uncomfortable with.
As soon as John's skin met his own, Sherlock watched his eyes dilate to twice their size, a near complete eclipse that Sherlock could feel his body responding to in kind.
Beside him, Sherlock slept on, sprawled over the width of the bed like a starfish, all long limbs and alabaster skin. One arm was cast out limply to the side, where John used to be.
It was risqué, offering John a position with his company and one that functioned so closely to his own, unknowing if he would quickly grow bored with his new enigma. When he'd approached Janine about his decision, Sherlock was surprised to find that he was genuinely nervous to hear what she had to say.
Holmes tilted his lips indulgently at the younger man, eyes skimming over John's face with impossible comprehension. "You're thinking quite loudly."
So it hadn't been a dream, then? John really had called Sherlock after drinking his sobriety away at The Watch House, and passed out in the man's bed. The smell of stale semen and his lack of clothes also told him that the second half of the night hadn't been an illusion, either.
"The loo is to your immediate right," Sherlock's voice rang out, loud in the abrupt silence of the flat.
. Aren't you quite the contrary little man. Hm, just John, then,” he said. “John, I'm afraid you'll have to be more specific in order for me to gain clarity.”
Please excuse any errors you may see here and feel free to point them out. I currently do not have beta for any of my stories. If you'd like to volunteer, please do contact me on
He closed his eyes against the wave of thoughts battering his brain and waited for the nausea to pass. He shook his head to clear his mind and blinked until the heavy slide of his lids lifted the fog and he could focus again.
Well, most of this chapter is porn, sorry! It had to be done though, however, this story is centered around sex, so there will be  a lot of it. If that's not your thing then you're reading the wrong story. Although this chapter is mostly sex, it is the catalyst for plotty things! So, I'm happy about that.
Sherlock could feel his lips pressing together, teeth grinding as he wondered how much more he’d have to do to dismantle this spider’s web he’d somehow became tangled in. Jim Moriarty was his one true regret. There’d been a darkness in him that Sherlock, to his own detriment, had found attractive. Dark eyes and dark hair to match the roil of even darker emotions behind a gleaming gaze.
It was frightening how easy it had been to relinquish control to Holmes, and fall into the trap John was sure he'd set from the start. How much longer would he be able to resist? Sherlock was the serpent in the garden of Eden, and John was the unlucky sod who couldn't resist a taste of what he was offering; John knew a bite of that apple could lead to a while world of trouble. His boss was danger in a pretty package.
John hadn't meant to react so violently, but his body was over-sensitized from Sherlock's ceaseless teasing. His body bucked up, searching for relief, but much to John's consternation, Sherlock pulled away.
Lady Grey was doing the foxtrot with the man, now, and once again, there was not a hitch in step. When the song ended, Lady Grey kissed the man’s cheek, smiling widely, then bowed to her audience. It was a standing ovation.
save his life, John. And the vicar has his fair share of secrets, including that he has at least one rendezvous a week with one of the church staff.”
John frowned, staring at his reflection in the tea. There were bags under his eyes from exhaustion and his lips were pressed in a firm line. "I dunno. Soon, maybe."
Alfie swaggered towards the huddled figure with his two minions, Tweedledum and Tweedledee, flanking him on either side. "Look at you," he sneered, "keepin' all the goods for yourself. Can you believe the selfish little bastard, Robbie?"
When Mrs. Hudson released him, the driver was already waiting at the car to open the door for her. She gave him a light peck on the cheek and returned to the car.
Sherlock trailed off as John pressed on further, looking for the gland that Sherlock always found so unerringly when John was at his mercy. John was was quickly losing himself in Sherlock, gluttonous, as Sherlock's thighs tightened around his ribs.
The bowl was empty and the cup had been drained upon contact. John fell back against the pipe, ribs expanding and retracting quickly as he allowed himself to breathe again. More, he needed more.
“...Friend!” She threw out her arm, giving the audience a jazz hand as confetti fell from the ceiling and the crowd applauded loudly. Abruptly, the lights went out.
"Took you long enough, John, I thought maybe you couldn't read my writing." Jasper waited until he reached the top of the stairs before he smiled brightly and pulled back, allowing John to enter.
"John," Sherlock prompted, "take what you want." His words were washed in sensuality, low, without a hint of reluctance or regret. Sherlock knew what he wanted, and he was offering it up on a silver platter.
Holmes threw him a knowing look and clasped his hands behind his back. "In two weeks time, my personal assistant, Janine, will only be available to work for me two days out of the week. I will need someone reliable to stand in her absence." Holmes paused his words and walked a slow circle around John. He followed the older man with his eyes, determined to keep him in sight.
He rolled over onto his back, staring at the ceiling for a moment, getting his bearings straight. His head felt muddy and unclear, and his eyes took longer than normal to focus on the cracks lining the inlet's ceiling. John scrubbed at his eyes with his palms and sighed, before pulling his hands away and sitting up.
ever, you fool, and he's mine," Sherlock spat acerbically. "Now get out. You've already ruined all of my hard work. It took me hours to get him to sleep!"
John said as much and Bill hummed, the breath equally as cold against his cheek as his touch had been. “They burned it… the hunters. They're looking for me. For all of us.”
They walked nowhere in particular, just a general direction of Sherlock's choosing. John had a million and one questions he wanted to ask the strange man, but he didn't want to disturb the tentative peace that settled between them.
John stared up at him demurely, suddenly insecure as this man regarded him with admiration. What would Sherlock possibly want with a young, homeless screw-up that occasionally sells his body for a warm meal?
Sherlock glared slightly, before pushing John out of the backseat, onto unsteady feet. "Yes, it's discreet and at the centre of London. Perfect for my work. Useless extravagance is more my brother's tastes."
Sherlock couldn't stop staring, though the infant was no longer paying him any mind, suckling on his tiny fists. Sherlock didn't want to hold him, didn't want to take that chance until he was sure. Sherlock didn't even understand why he was entertaining the ridiculous notion that somehow whatever Förstner injected into John would turn him into an infant overnight. People didn't get second chances like that; science didn't work that way.
John nearly clamped his legs closed, but his curiosity held him still. What Sherlock said earlier, he wanted that, to wait until it could be him, but he wanted the man even more than that promise.
In his mind palace, everything began to crumble. The doors in every hall we're cracked and splintered and the stairs trembled beneath his feet as he traversed them one step at a time. If everything collapsed, it would be fine, because without John, none of it was meaningful.
John swept his tongue over his lower lip again, and this time Sherlock saw it for what it was. John was nervous.
John grinned at his friend's alacrity, though not quite sure how much he should tell her. Sarah wasn't a chatty woman, and he knew his secret was safe with her, but it wasn't wise to tell her everything.
John smiled, hiding his confusion at the words. Lestrade wasn't the type to speak in riddles, so what did he mean by that statement?
Sherlock lifted the strap of his bag from around his shoulder and dropped it to the ground. Digging out clothes seemed to be his last priority and John was having a hard time keeping his eyes from dipping below chest level.
John’s lower lip caught the towel as it brushed across, then released alluringly to reveal a mouth the colour of cherry blossoms. Sherlock skimmed his lips up to the underside of John’s jaw as he dropped the towel in the bowl where it turned the water a rosy shade.
Fortunately, Liam was busy with a phone call and incapable of talking Sherlock’s ear off his bloody skull. The boy’s only saving grace was that he was exceptional at his job and a lot less of a distraction than John ever was. He’d had a few moments of regretting his decision to hire John when the only thing Sherlock could think about was making John ride his cock as they reviewed daily reports.
John turned to Holmes and smiled with no amount of humour. "So," he began, "do you treat all of your employees that way?" John nodded towards the phone on Sherlock's desk.
It was a war wound, and most likely the reason for John being invalided from the army. The entrance wound would no doubt be smaller than the exit, but the size of it suggested a sniper rifle at long distance. It was a crack shot, very neat from the front, but Sherlock had yet to see the outlet.
John’s face went warm as he realized Holmes was, in fact, talking to him. Oh!” He said, a bit flustered to be honest, as if they hadn’t just fucked in front of a camera. “I hope it was what you were expecting.”
Let it be said that Sherlock Holmes was not a shopper and anyone who said so obviously did not have eyes.
"Mr. Holmes would like to know what is the reason for your visit..." Yeah, that was the best he had. On the other end, Sherlock was grumbling into his ear like a sulking teenager.
The first feel of Sherlock's fingers skating the skin of his perineum and down to his anus, was tentative and venturing. John closed his eyes, trying not to remember the last time someone touched him down there. It wasn't for pleasure, and it hadn't been with his consent. With all the negative connotations that came with sex, for John, he wondered why it was that he felt so lax with someone he'd just met. He knew nothing about Sherlock, and yet, here he was, accepting this man between his legs with the utmost confidence that he wouldn't do anything to hurt John.
It was one thing to know your employee, but John didn't like the idea that someone was watching him. A quick glance at the window assured that the curtains were tightly closed. It made him feel slightly more at ease.
Anthea sat beside him, eyes glued to her phone screen. She was squinting down at her mobile with furrowed brows drawing deep crevices across her forehead. Either Anthea didn’t realize she had myopia, or she was stubborn and in denial. Her eyes flicked towards Mycroft then back to her phone, which she inclined until it nearly touched the tip of her pointed nose.
John had already ordered tea, and held his between his palms, staring solemnly down into the cup before answering. “I ship out tomorrow.”
John nodded and came to stand beside Sherlock, gently plucking the photo from his fingers. John and Irene after his first performance, holding up matching pints at some bar they’d all packed into. He was a bit younger then, but save for a few new wrinkles, John would like to think he was the same person in the picture.
With no warning, a sudden all-encompassing warmth had descended over his erection, slick and tight. Fuck, there was no mistaking those lips as they wrapped round him in one fell swoop.
The ride home to Lewisham was sullen and quiet. Shortly after Holmes' lewd promise in his ear, John had stuttered out an excuse to leave, and Holmes had dismissed him. He didn't leave the foyer until John was getting ready to board the lift. The entire time he'd been tidying up, Holmes' penetrating gaze never left him. It unnerved John, but the spike of pleasure he felt at the attention left him addled.
Above them, the sun shone brightly through the thin canopy of trees, illuminating the clearing they were slowly making their way through. In the distance, John could see a hare watching them warily, ready to turn and dart at a moment's notice, behind it, two leverets hovered close to their mother.
John rolled his eyes, refusing to acknowledge the blush crawling up his neck. “A lady doesn’t kiss and tell,” he grumbled.
"If you don't relax, Jasper will know the minute he walks through that door." Sherlock's face held more seriousness than John had seen since he met the man, and he wondered what he must look like to warrant such a specific warning.
Sherlock jerked him close as John's tongue reached his lips, and as he was particularly brilliant at doing, the wolf devoured him.
Bill laughed and it echoed hauntingly in between the trees. There were no sounds for miles; just Bill and his own voice and Sherlock's sharp gaze prickling at the back of his neck.
John’s breath hitched as he fully processed what Sherlock was asking him, and then he felt a hot bolt of desire strike between his belly and his cock. Sherlock continued without waiting for John to respond.
Mike coughed and cleared his throat. "Everyone knows Holmes is not a nice fellow, John, but he's a powerhouse in the scientific community. He may not be the ideal humanitarian, but the man is a genius."
Nothing, John thought to himself naïvely, nothing could possibly happen half an hour before his departure. Of course, he'd been wrong.
Sherlock pecked his way up to the potent area between John’s thigh and cock, where he stopped to bury his nose. The tickle of lace knickers made his nostrils itch, but he ignored it in favour of burrowing deeper. He cupped his hands beneath John’s arse and pulled him forward, turning so that his mouth brushed that covered erection.
He slid into the bed and pulled John into his lap, cradling him as he did nights ago, when the child was an infant. John was a warm weight in his arms, sweat soaking through his pyjamas as Sherlock held onto him, trembling. Sherlock left the lights off when it grew dark, but the curtains open to allow the moonlight to penetrate.
His father, at last taking pity on John, stepped in, gently placing his hands on his son's shoulders and out of his wife's clutches. "Julia, you wicked woman, give the boy some air," he demanded with good nature, winking at John when his mother scoffed in dismay.
Before Sherlock realized what he was doing, his hand was reaching forward to grab her waist to stop her from going. Uncertain, Sherlock pulled her in slowly, sure that Lady Grey was allowing him to touch her so thoughtlessly. “Will I see you here again?”
He pulled John into the room, assured of the knowledge that his… partner, with his infinite loyalty and terrifying affection, would not resist.
And it was true. John's mind was constantly on Sherlock as much as it was on the hunters, but even he was clever enough to know that that was an unhealthy balance. He was getting attached.
John watched her as she made a beeline for the exit, then reached down for his clothes. He patted his pockets and sure enough, the rectangular outline of a card pressed against the back pocket of his denims.
A loud groan ripped from his throat as John pressed his nose further, further down until Sherlock was once again balancing on his upper back. Embarrassingly enough, Sherlock began to whimper as John's tongue peeked out, licking up the juices that were now trailing up his back with the change of position.
Right on queue, John heard the tell-tale sound of slapping skin. John had never been shy about sex and had enthusiastically engaged in it before his time with Bill and during, but hearing Sherlock, the cold, antagonizing alpha, vigorously participating in the next room had the skin on John's arms prickling with heat.
Sherlock's 's face went blank in thought before he leaned back into his seat, with a new gleam in his eyes that made John wary. “By all means, then. Continue.” Sherlock waved his hand in a gesture that John was meant to take as a go ahead to confess his sins to a man that wasn't even ordained to do this sort of thing. Then again, maybe this was divine intervention, because God knows that if John's little trip to the church didn't work, then he’d be having another silent conversation with his gun that night.
Blushing slightly, Sherlock looked down at his interlocked hands resting on the table. “Well where else was I going to get decent Italian cuisine in London,” Sherlock sniffed, turning his attention to the street outside the window. If this wasn't Sherlock Holmes he was sitting across from, John would have thought he was being bashful.
Together, Sally and John took down two. John feigned a lunge for the leg as a distraction while Sally crept up behind the enemy from behind. The hunter caught on at the last moment and turned with his gun raised, but stopped short as Sally bared her teeth in a hair-raising snarl, much closer than he'd expected her to be. John found himself turning away when the female wolf tackled the hunter to the ground. The resounding screams told him that it wasn't a merciful death.
The place was swarmed with businessmen in tailored suits and manicured women in their smart suit jackets and pencil skirts, all lost in their phones and clipboards, pushing past John as he observed in dread.
"Yes, yes, now let me get back to sleep, thank you. And text me the time and location, if you will."
Sherlock shifted, stiffening further in his trousers at the feel of soft, lush skin. John’s breaths were uneven now, skittering past his lips as Sherlock moved his hand up the inside of his thigh and over his cock. He stroked him lightly until John was easing his hips into the rhythm of Sherlock’s slow pumps.
Finally, the older man paused, turning to look at the two teenagers, John staring in wide eyed confusion and Jasper was almost jumping out of his trousers in anticipation. "Come
He reached up to touch it, his lips parted in awe. The prosthetic was smooth and rubbery to the touch, and Sherlock could feel the slight bumps and ridges of a ragged scar. His mind brought up a visual of a bullet tearing through John's shoulder and exploding as it ripped through tissue and muscle, before forcing its way out the back. It would have been excruciating and going by the size and feel of John's scar, his trouble hadn't ended there.
There were a thousand new questions, all fighting to be answered first, and John's head was hammering beneath the onslaught.
. Sherlock's eyes closed blissfully in the reflection, the picture of serenity and satisfaction, his nose pressed into John's cheek.
John reached up to his left shoulder, and in a move that alarmed Sherlock, dug beneath the skin with his nails.
"Sorry," John mumbled and turned to face the man once again, wishing he had been more prepared to come face-to-face with Holmes.
When morning came, John pulled the cover over his head to block out the light coming from the window, while Jasper padded loudly up and down the stairs in preparation for the day. John didn't consider that his friend might be making as much noise as possible intentionally; that is until something soft and yielding landed solidly on his head.
John had never gotten close to humans before, had been taught since he was a pup that they weren't to be trusted, but even then, John had never seen such hatred for them before. Sherlock's snarl as he called them 'animals', the distinctly far away look he adopted when Mycroft referred to past run-ins with humans. There was obviously a history there, something ominous, that may have happened to Sherlock. Would John ever know? Would Sherlock ever tell him?
John exhaled shakily, heart jumping to his throat in excitement. Sherlock was looking at him with something like hope and longing and John was sure his eyes were reflecting the same sentiments. He stepped forward and pulled Sherlock down by his lapels. The older man stared at him with unmasked desire and John knew he was thrilled by the possibility of Jasper walking in at any moment, seeing them like this, but the sudden offer of danger and adventure is what fueled him. John wanted this, wanted to feel alive.
John hesitated, staying Sherlock’s insistent hand with two of his own against Sherlock’s thighs, resisting him.
Murray stared at the photo of John, unsure, and tore his eyes away briefly to meet Sherlock's steady gaze with his own uncertain one. “Wait, so my enlistment date changing… the earlier date and all,  that was you?”
Sherlock opened his mouth to speak, and then promptly closed it again at the uncomfortable clench in his lower abdomen. With the suppressants, it was a sensation he hadn't been privy to in years.
Sherlock scoffed, folding his arms over his chest like a petulant child, rather than like the grown man with a considerable amount of wealth and influence. "Is that what friends do with one another these days," Sherlock enquired bitterly, "curl up for afternoon cuddles, John? Perhaps I might give that a try. Irene has been pestering me about watching some banal film I haven't the slightest interest in."
Sherlock reached for his collar and pulled it away from his skin. His jaw tensed. When he looked back at John, his blue eyes were sharper than before. “Continue.”
An hour later, John was reading the paper in the sitting room when the sound of the bathroom door shutting pulled his attention away. John folded the paper nervously and waited for Sherlock to emerge, unsure of how things had changed in the light of day.
John cleared his throat, ending the wordless feud between the two and held up his index finger. "Still here," he pointed out. "Just to remind you, I didn't actually ask for your help so if you'd kindly release me, I'll be on my way. Thanks."
How could he possibly have put John through that? Watching him jump off of Barts, that stifling, suffocating horror wrapped around every breath. Seeing John die, Sherlock had every intention of joining John, but he hadn't deduced
Cold lips brushed against the back of John's exposed neck, exhaling in soft, breathy puffs that made him shiver. Sherlock seemed hesitant to move any closer, and his heart was beating quickly against John's back.
“I-” John wouldn’t meet his eyes, not until Sherlock forced him to with a finger to tip his chin up. “What about Moriarty? Are you going to let him go?”
. Fury crawled up his belly with claws that sank deep, buried itself in his throat and made him want to scream, lodged in his brain and dredged up bitter thoughts.
Then there were breaths near his neck, wetness on the back of his shoulder where a damp muzzle sniffled. John hadn't heard him coming, and before he realized it, John was feeling the rippling vibrations of the change beneath his skin.
John blinked rapidly, feeling his pulse race double time, which no doubt the other man could hear... and the fear; John was sure the stranger could smell that, too.
John didn’t waste any time, wrapping his hand around Sherlock’s thick, blushing member with hands that did not tremble. The head of his cock pearled with pre-come, smeared across the pad of John’s thumb in a gentle motion that made Sherlock quiver with ecstasy. His bones set to quaking, and the same rush that always accompanied a high shot through his veins as John twisted his wrist expertly.
Obviously, Sherlock didn't feel the same inclination to be in constant communication with John as he, himself, did, so maybe it was time to draw the line. It would be wise to put some space between them. John didn't want to be a slave to his body, nor to the man that could seemingly own it with just his touches.
Even as his breathing slowed, his blood rushed through his veins, heavy and thick. Sherlock blinked, but it felt slow and sluggish. His mouth flooded with saliva.
"How much have you taken, mum?" John was truly scared for his mother. Her life revolved around the drugs and the pain and the memories. For as long as he could remember, she just waddled in her own misery.
Sherlock's face was grim, and his pale eyes, a twin pair of hard, cold pearls. "Unintentionally, yes. However, they do not know of our specific location, yet, and we won't be staying long enough for them to find out."
Lady Grey’s lips stopped moving, and the track played, but neither of them were paying attention to it anymore. “Oh baby for all it's worth, I swear I'll be the first to blow your mind.”
With bated breath, John moved forward to step beside Sherlock and glanced around, not quite sure exactly what he was looking at.
His hair was gleaming under the lights, strands of blond standing out like strings of gold, and slicked back in a classic Cary Grant coiffure. John's dark blue eyes stood out piercingly, and for once, John could see the appeal of cleaning up once in awhile. He looked damned good.
They were nose-to-nose now, chest puffed out with pride and bravado, and John wanted nothing more than to rearrange this buggers face, see that stupidly perfect nose drip red.
forgive you.” So softly, Sherlock spoke the words, every bone in his body trembling with rage. He couldn't lose John. He would rather die first.
Finally, the earplugs were carefully placed in John's ear, and shortly after, the gentle chords of a piano playing an evocative sonata was all he could hear. With his sight and sound impeded, the anticipation of the moment was heightened, the thrill of not knowing what Sherlock would do to him next.
Upon entry, the place looked like any flat building; entry hall on the ground floor, a set of stairs leading up to the first floor, and a door just behind the staircase that led to the basement. He opened it and entered.
All the old equipment was heavy and large, as electronics tended to be in the eighties. Besides the plastic chairs shoved one atop the other in the corners, there wasn't much that could be used in the way of a weapon. The gun was too far in the corner off to his left. All it would take was a millisecond for Förstner to realize Sherlock's plan and depress the drug into John's vein. Sherlock was quick, but not quick enough. He needed a proper distraction.
“There may come a time when a lass needs a lawyer.” The hands carried her through the crowd, and they spun her as the showgirls loosely circled her, undulating their arms. “But diamonds are a girl’s best friend!”
"You have such a lovely arse, John, I want to redden it. I would attain so much pleasure from putting you over my knee," Sherlock's voice was gaining vehemence with every word, growing rough as he began to dismantle. He was properly growling down the phone. "You're so undisciplined, insubordinate. It's what I like about you, but it makes me want to bend you over the nearest surface and spank your arse until it's black and blue."
John reached up, eschewing Sherlock’s t-shirt for the elastic band of his pyjama pants. He tugged against the band, and smirked as Sherlock’s cock sprang up eagerly. The cool air on his prick relieved him. God, when was the last time he had his cock in John’s hand, mouth, arse? He thrilled at what was to come.
Sherlock watched him for a moment, hesitant now that they were alone again. Sherlock fidgeted, unsure what to do with his hands, without the option of shoving them in his coat pockets.
Sherlock sat up, too, his halo of curls wild and dark against a landscape of pale skin. He leaned forward into John's space, pushing forward until John was pressed back against the headboard, and kissed him roughly. When Sherlock pulled away, his jaw was set. “Regret has no place in our bed,” he said.
Sherlock dismissed Liam to retrieve a tray of biscuits and tea before turning and regarding Victor with a reserved look. “Irene told you, then.”
Molly turned, carrying a infant boy with a shock of blond hair and wailing loud enough to alert the entire hospital. He stayed near the door, his eyes moving around the room, looking for John.
The café decor was festive and bright, while the waiters skirted around the room in white aprons. The music was low and subtle, nothing like the thumping, brassy sounds of the cabaret at top attendance, and the crowd was less rowdy.
, finding someone who could match Sherlock's iron will made him giddy. Sherlock wanted to tame him, but he'd had more than his fair share of simpering Alphas. This, Sherlock hoped, would be different.
Looking at him now, Sherlock couldn’t dredge up more than the dull ache that resided in his chest constantly since John came into his life. It was like a disease there was no cure for, he couldn’t just make it go away, as much as he burned to most days. It made him feel compassion when all he wanted to do was rant and rave, and tear John down for leaving.
Sherlock's hands were hurting where they compressed John's chest, growing tired and drained of the strength it would take to keep going. He could hear boots beating against the lino in the hall, the buzz of wheels against the floor as they pushed the stretcher into the room. All of it was background noise. None of it mattered. He kept going.
John could practically see Holmes rolling his eyes as he tapped out this message, and the thought made him snicker quietly. Yes, there was no doubt exactly who he was texting.
He was losing his breath, and sweat dripped down from his curls to land on John’s back as he leant over him, pumping his hips. Then it came, blinding him as the orgasm washed through Sherlock’s body like a tidal wave, taking him up and up, only to brutally bring him crashing down.
Sherlock smiled, but it wasn't humorous and served only to inspire goose pimples along the length of John's arms. “I'll thank you not take the Lord's name in vain, John,” Sherlock rumbled disarmingly. Suddenly, the atmosphere in the room dropped another depth and John knew that whatever was meant to happen would take place in the next moment. Sherlock didn't disappoint. “I can't imagine that anyone who has seen you on your knees in this manner would allow you to leave them,” he commented.
John turned fully, and Sherlock’s hands tightened on his arms as they faced one another. “Well, I’ve never been the type of bloke to put out on the first date,” he quipped, and Sherlock’s head jerked back in surprise, a startled chuckle leaving his lips.
Sherlock nodded and stood, turning to face the pack, an inscrutable mask set firmly in place as they looked upon him with sombre gazes.
"Would you care to take a seat?" Sherlock made certain to curve his words on the tail end of the sentence, though they both knew that it was a thinly veiled demand.
Jasper chuckled lightly and turned back to John. "Dad took me on a few cases with him last week; usually they ended in us running through dark alleys and chasing bad guys."
"John, are you alright in there, mate? I heard you yelling last night." Mike. His voice was muffled through the door, but his worry was clear. John was torn between guilt and a hate so strong he had actually begun to wake up.
After Sherlock left with the Lestrade gentleman at noon, he hadn't returned. John spent the rest of the day typing up boring reports (one of which, he'd found himself drifting off halfway through) and thwarting attempts from aggressive businessmen, eager to get themselves a place on Sherlock's overflowing schedule.
“Sometimes, all they wanted was a blowjob, so I would do it back in the tent, when everyone was in the mess hall or out on patrol, that way no one would walk in.”
Bill never hid anything from John, never pretended that he was feeling any other way than how he felt. But Bill was always angry, though he used his emotions cleverly.
He didn't know what he was thinking, getting involved with a man like Sherlock. They had almost nothing in common, besides the sex, and there were obviously things that Sherlock didn't want him to know.
John slid his hands in Sherlock's hair and pulled, delighting at the sensation of Sherlock's cock jerking against his thigh.
John closed his eyes and leant back against the tree, listening for any sign of Sherlock approaching. He was sure it had been half an hour when he left him with the dead human, and still no sign of him.
John gasped as Sherlock’s fingers prodded his prostate and Sherlock chased the sound straight to the source, delving inside his wet-warm mouth with desperation.
John licked his lips, nervous, and Sherlock's eyes tracked the progress of his tongue. God, why did he have to be so tempting?
The music had faded out seconds, minutes, hours ago, and all that was left was the cacophony of his breath, along with Sherlock's, mingling as they climbed towards the ultimate climax.
Years ago, his sister, Harry, had gone ahead and topped herself before she'd had any real taste of how bitter their life would become. John was essentially, in every sense of the word, alone.
John snickered at his friend's mollifying, though he couldn't deny the fact that Mike and Kate adored one another, and he was happy for them. He wondered if things had worked out with Sarah, would they have been the same way? The thought is sobering, and John is forced to remember that a few moments ago, he was silently rejoicing in the fact that he was single.
It was wrong, so very very wrong, but John was angry and Sherlock's presence wasn't helping. He'd told himself not to get too attached, not to fall for Sherlock, because rela-
Sherlock retrieved it with a triumphant, “Ah-ha!”, then focused all of that singular attention on John again.
Sherlock's hands were on him, round him, one pushing the shirt off his shoulders while the other gracefully undid the button on his denims. All the while, his mouth descended once more and refused to let up. John could feel the tickle of Sherlock's breath against his cheeks as he breathed rapidly through his nose, just as John did, exhilarated by the proximity of their heated bodies, the imminence of a joining that would be no less than spectacular. It was brilliant and welcomed, and John didn't want that moment to expire even if the world came crashing down at their feet.
Sarah was worried, but there was nothing that John could say to placate her because whatever she was feeling wasn't unfounded. John was worried, too. There was never a moment in which John had prepared for someone like Moriarty, there was no contingency plan.
The rest of the set went by without a snag and ended with a standing ovation. When he stood to clap, Lady Grey caught his eye and sent him a wink.
And there it was. John meant something to Sherlock, so why did John feel as if he'd been jilted? Maybe because he'd thought that it was possible that while he was falling, so was Sherlock. The man had certainly led him to believe that it was possible. Then, John thought about the pictures, about Moriarty's words, thought about what he couldn't give to Sherlock.
When there was nothing left to show, they set a slow pace back to the foyer. "Well, I have to be honest. You're not quite what I was expecting in regards to Sherlock's tastes."
Lestrade stopped at the SUV and turned to John, regarding him with a serious countenance. “You take care of yourself, John, and Sherlock too. Take it from me, the man can be a handful, but I know you can handle it.” Lestrade cracked a smile, and John couldn't help but return it, though the moment of lightness was over too quickly. Lestrade placed a heavy hand on John's shoulder and squeezed. “You're a strong man, John Watson, a good man. Don't let him break you.”
Before he could finish his sentence, Sherlock pulled him forward roughly, into a heaving chest, and everything John had been about to say, flew right out the window.
John licked his lips and began again, eyebrows nearly to his hairline as he considered what he hadn't before. "I mean, I didn't take you for a video game kind of bloke, but now that I think of it, you probably beat Dark Souls, didn't you? Jesus, it literally took me months to beat that game, and by then, I was consisting solely on caffeine and Jammie Dodgers, if you can believe it." That was one of the sweetest moments of his life, the day he finished that game. Mike had been so worried about him, because he hadn't left the room much during that time.
It was hot and rough and Sherlock’s sweat dripped on his face, and his on the pillow, but it was everything John hadn’t had in years; filthy, uninhibited, raw.
The fingers dancing at the hem of John’s knickers pushed forward and into the gap, dipping to trace a cautious line up the split of his arse. Sherlock had pulled back to watch him, his eyes so hungry and demanding  as they burned right into his own. He refused to relent even when John’s eyes drifted shut as a hand cupped his swollen balls. John moaned, wishing that Sherlock would be there with him forever, whispering utterly filthy things into his ear with his fine, euphonious baritone.
He'd barely placed his phone down before John heard the notification sound. Someone was a little overzealous.
Unfortunately for him, Holmes was standing at his desk, leaned against it casually, while he tapped away on his mobile. "Morning John," he stated, unable to tear his eyes away from the screen for only a moment.
But, Sherlock could admit to being an opportunist. It was how he got to where he was in life. Patience was a virtue that never got him anything but frustrated. So he wasn’t going to take John’s sudden presence in his life lightly, and he wasn’t going to waste time.
“Be careful with that one,” Irene cautioned, reapplying her lipstick. “I know men like him; have had a few warm my bed before. I’m quite certain that Sherlock Holmes is a devilish man.” Irene put down the lipstick and turned to John with a wicked smirk. “But I suppose one devil always knows another.”
On the desk, under the lamplight, John's phone vibrated, the screen lighting up with a text message notification. It was, perhaps, the worst time possible to entertain the notion of a conversation, but John wasn’t completely averse to the thought of a distraction. John placed his feet on the floor and stood up, willing his trembling knees to stay still. If he could grab hold of himself, then he could be strong when the time came to talk to Sherlock.
Just as the man was going in for another strike, an unfamiliar voice cut through the chaos, and as one, everything stopped.
Holmes’ lips parted, but the moment was thwarted as the director called for them to take their places. It was a simple scene. The premise was “after-school studying”, and of course, Molly would be the main focus, though it was bisexual in nature. Some touching was required between John and Holmes, but again, that wasn’t a complaint. John found that he quite enjoyed the cold, crude slant of Holmes’ eyes on his body from where he flanked Molly’s other side.
Sherlock woke to John’s back, heated and perspiring against his chest. Wisps of dove grey light seeped through the curtains, casting the room in a wintry luminescence. Wrinkling his nose at the wet noise of their sweat-dampened skin peeling apart as he rolled onto his back, Sherlock stretched languidly against soft, body-warm sheets.
Bourbon and cigarettes, a sinful elixir on his tongue, and John couldn't help but think of that taste when he thought of his illicit kiss with Holmes. Long, skillful fingers carding through his hair, and soft touches on his body; his thighs parting for that magnificent man to settle between. It was a fantasy turned reality, and last night it could have gone further, had John not regained control of himself.
Lestrade shot him a look that informed John of his comprehension on the matter, before spinning on his heels and walking towards the door at the end of the hallway. Warm light spilled through the crack, and John could smell the burning of firewood as they drew closer. Lestrade turned and flashed one last reassuring grin before he opened the door.
John’s neck was corded as he tilted it back, and Sherlock could see his pulse thumping in his neck. He was fighting an orgasm, which was all well and good, but Sherlock wanted to feel that wet heat spilling on his stomach.
Her blue eyes caught his briefly, and there was a tiny smile at the corner of her lips. She was stunning, undoubtedly, but even so, his eyes kept drifting back to Lady Grey behind the bars. He didn’t watch as the blonde and the red-headed woman began to tango around the stage with their respective partners.
the way, Sherlock,” John whispered vehemently. He may have been young, but at the moment, he felt older than his years, weighed down with the guilt of Harry, and now his blindness to Sherlock's pain. Had it been a willful thing, the inability to see past the exterior to what dark things that lie beneath?
For months he’d corresponded with Sherlock until the letters abruptly stopped. Shortly after, he received a short, clipped call from Mycroft Holmes that he was to sever all correspondence with his brother, and that Sherlock would no longer be responding.
had the nerve to follow him and invade in his private life! John hadn't even told his parents about Sherlock - not that he'd particularly planned on it, either - and now they were probably spitting their morning herbals all over one another at the kitchen table.
If John could describe the moment, he would say it was like an earthquake. One minute, John is going about life as usual, unprepared, unassuming and then so suddenly, everything becomes shaky and tilted and suddenly his feet are off the ground, and he's no longer standing. Yeah, it was something like that, except there was no earthquake and London was still there, and now John had to go out and
For the majority of what was left of their hour, Sherlock prodded and John, for the most part, stayed infuriatingly closed mouth when he didn't feel comfortable answering. The amount of progress could be equated to zilch.
Of course Sherlock knew, but by the way his heart leapt at the words it was as if he’d discovered it for the first time.
yet. Oh, but when it did, Jim was going to giggle with triumph, because then he’d remember why all of this dirty work was so propitious!
Then it was Sunday morning and Sherlock was pushing into the loo while John showered, already divesting his clothes as he prattled on about his case with Detective Inspector Lestrade of Scotland Yard, whom John had only met once, briefly, at the office.
Sherlock huffed and averted his gaze out the window, knowing that Victor wouldn’t stop until he had his answers. Sometimes he could be as bad as Mycroft.
His father's eyebrows shot up, though not quite to his hairline, before his grin quickly turned lecherous. "Well, well
. He was afraid to open his eyes and see that steely gaze directed at him, untrusting and devoid of affection.
Great, and it was 3:23. He was across town in a strange bed, and he had no clothes to change into for work. This was more than a new level of stupidity; it was carelessness. Hopefully, by the time he had this whole mess sorted and his groveling completed, John would still have a job to rush to.
Thumping his curly head sideways against the window, Jasper nodded unhappily and wrapped his threadbare coat tighter around himself.
“Sleep well?” Mycroft enquired icily, his green eyes scanning Sherlock in that ever-familiar way. Sherlock resisted the urge to growl in annoyance. Honestly, the silly games they played with one another. Sherlock didn't have the patience for it, so he said nothing. Mycroft walked around to the end of the bed and picked up the clipboard, flipping the pages back as his eyes scanned the sheets. “Cocaine intoxication. Tachycardia. High blood pressure. The list goes on,” Mycroft said quietly, firmly.
“Julia!” Rupert admonished, startled, at the same time that Sherlock moved to check him for damage, though was halted by a quick glare of warning from John.
On the side of an abandoned flat, Jasper spotted a ladder leading up to a fire escape, and so he pulled it down, intending to climb inside the building and wait it out, but suddenly, there was a voice at the mouth of the alley, shouting at him.
John immediately missed the warmth of Sherlock’s body and collapsed sideways to lay on the couch as the man did… whatever. He turned onto his back, his legs falling open wantonly. Sherlock was searching his vanity. “Vaseline is in the bottom drawer on the left.”
Before he could delve further into his unbidden thoughts, John crossed the room to shut the door, despite Lestrade's unspoken order. Nope, he wasn't listening to that all night.
London with the knowledge that his image was plastered over the front page next to Sherlock bloody Holmes in what had to be
John, realizing Sherlock might possibly never finish that sentence, advanced slowly, watching as the opalescent gaze of his boss followed every movement. Sherlock had managed to gain some of his composure by this point, and now his gaze was a steady laser beam, heated and clear. His jaw was clenched tightly, the muscles there pressed against his skin in stark relief.
“You look well-rested. The first night we met, and since then, you’ve had heavy bags under your eyes, though you did quite an admirable job using the make-up to conceal them. Usually, you don’t bother with changing if you’ve come straight from the cabaret. Also, your cab came from the opposite direction. I suppose you could have gone a roundabout way, but you’re nothing if not prudent with your spending money, and the freshness of your perfume indicates a short ride from your flat, and not enough time for it to fade properly. If you’d come from the cabaret, even a short walk through the grand room, the fabric of your coat would have absorbed the smell of tobacco.”
“Is someone in trouble,” John enquired. He didn't have his Browning at hand, but he still remembered a few basic lessons in combat.
"There were tears streaming down your face, but you weren't hurting. You were overwhelmed by my touch and tilting your hips up to take my fingers deeper." The vibrations started again and John turned his face into Sherlock's neck, moaning against the creamy skin, the heady smell of sex permeating his nostrils. "Mm, just like you are now. You had a collar on that linked to nipple clamps, so any time you moved too much, it would pull until your nipples turned a dashing shade of red. You came apart so beautifully." The plug silenced again.
Sherlock closed the distance between them, placing one long-fingered hand on John's hipbone, a light touch that was worth a thousand words. He reeked of tobacco, but underneath it, Sherlock's scent was heady and arousing. "You don't know much about me, so I'll forgive your ignorance on this matter, but I want to make certain that you understand, John."
“No, truly, Sherlock, I’m flattered,” John said, grinning up at him. “Don’t get compliments much in this industry. Everyone has had it in every way, nothing is… novel.” He looked away, feeling unaccountably sheepish under Sherlock’s confident, knowing stare.
He felt uneasy, following a man he'd just witnessed brutally murder two surrendering men, but John would be lying if he repudiated the fact that there was also an underlying giddiness. The space between them was charged with an undeniable current of electricity. Watching Sherlock protect his pack so viciously had left John more than a bit excited, and the wolf inside rumbled with pleasure.
Jasper was doubled over in amusement, very near to cackling as he rehashed the nights events. "Oh my God, did you see his face? The look- Oh God, the look!" He promptly collapsed into another laughing fit, wiping the tears from his eyes.
John slid off the couch and onto his knees between her trembling thighs. His hands trailed up until his fingers were hooked over the band of her tiny, tartan skirt. John glanced up as Molly tilted her hips up, allowing him to pull the skirt down and off her legs.
The cab ride was mercifully short, and a short trip later, the car was easing out of traffic and beside the crowded pavement of the cabaret. Inside, the foyer was decorated with gaudy silks and the twinkling light of the chandelier reflected brightly against the fabric, granting the room a cheerful look. Men and women were clustered in groups, moving from one to another with ease as they sipped from glistening flutes of champagne. The grand room doors were open, and Sherlock could see that there was already a large crowd gathered there.
When he turned back, Mycroft's face was stern, but clear, as was the message behind it all. “No more of this nonsense. I've told you before, and I will tell you again: caring is not an advantage.”
pouting - and John laughed, going to ruffle Sherlock's monstrous hair. Sherlock swatted at his hand and sat up, glaring furiously at the younger man currently two breaths away from doubling over at the grown man behaving so childishly. "
Sherlock went low and grabbed John around the waist, flipping them over so that John was above him. It was his first time, Sherlock suspected, of being with a man. John balanced his weight with both hands on either side of Sherlock's head, his strong fingers squeezing the pillows as he adjusted to Sherlock's length settled in his arse until it couldn't go any further. When John was comfortable, Sherlock thrust his hips up the tiniest bit, unable to look away for a moment. He was pressed to remember every detail of John's face when they were together.
By the time he'd fallen asleep after his spontaneous wank, the novelty of John's precarious situation with Holmes had worn off.
. Sherlock didn't seem to care about Moriarty's threat, but John keenly remembered the man's final diatribe before he left 221B
The woman never noticed him before his teeth were sinking into the space between her shoulder and neck, crushing through weak, thin skin and fragile, human bones. Then, everything descended into chaos.
John nodded vehemently, eager to wrap his hands around Sherlock's cock, to feel him squeeze around John's cock, to taste his come. “Please, sir, I want to, please.”
Hello all! I hope you enjoyed this chapter! I know it was shorter than usual, but it flowed to a natural end, and I found that stuffing in anything more would only take from the chapter. Thank you all for your continued support! You are all so wonderful, and it surprises me every time how much attention this story is actually getting! I can't say thank you enough! Anyways, for those of you who would like update info, occasional snippets, or just general Sherlock-y things, come join me on
His composure was tearing at the seams, thread by thread, until he could no longer restrain himself from reaching out to touch, just a finger over John’s hand, still limp by his side.
Once their amusement abated, Holmes looked at him expectantly, and John steeled himself for what was to come.
Sherlock took his time in the shower, washing the dried sweat off his body, John's sweat off his hands. He thought about the drastic change overnight, the leap in age. It was as if John’s body had undergone metamorphosis, not unlike a butterfly. John died. Sherlock held him through it, felt his body stiffen with rigor mortis.
That night, John began to crawl, slowly, at first and gradually began to progress with the evening. Sherlock laid on his back over the bed watching as John crawled clumsily over his legs, smiling when the infant's chubby arms couldn't hold him up anymore.
Another undulation of her torso, and she was rolling to her hands and knees to stand gracefully. In a carelessly prurient manner, Lady Grey ran her hands down her body, her lips moving through the words without much thought. “Now if you're ready, come and get me. I'll give you that hot, sweet, sexy loving.”
Sherlock felt alive, whole for the first time in years. Of all the men he’d tasted, John was the sweetest. He’d missed the sound of his voice, that little whimper whenever Sherlock entered him. John loved his fingers, the length of them, all the places they could reach inside of him. Sherlock shamelessly played on this advantage, wringing as many wanton moans as he could from his lover’s throat.
“Please be careful, John,” Sarah whispered sternly against his neck. He could feel her heart hammering against his. A lock of hair tickled his nose, and John didn't know whether he wanted to laugh or cry.
John sat up slowly, willing the wary ache in his bones to settle and the pain in his shoulder to dull to a lesser degree. Somewhere in the hall, he could hear the low murmurs of a conversation. John recognized one as Lestrade, unable to mistake that gruff voice, the result of having been a smoker most of his life, John assumed.
Just as on the first night however, he didn't stand a chance. Sherlock's heavy weight barreled into him heavily from behind, and John had the sudden thought that this was what being hit by a lorry felt like. It was more of a controlled, tactical attack, where on the first night, Sherlock had been running on pure instincts in the act of protecting his territory.
He spun away from John and headed to his desk, grabbing his coat from the back of his chair and swinging it over his shoulders. "John, I need you to have her instructions memorized. You'll be on your own tomorrow."
By the time they were leaving, the sky was just turning darker hues of blues and pinks, the sun, a burnished orange bulb in the distance. “We'll go the long way, avoid the river. They'll expect us to stay close to a water source.”
Holmes watched John in wary bemusement, a little line appearing on the bridge of his nose as he furrowed his brows. "I'm afraid I don't understand."
Jim saw Sherlock's weakness and loathed him for it, and now, Puppy was an unforgivable sign of just how much Sherlock needed to be reminded of their time together.
"You're doing very well, John," Sherlock stated, voice rougher than usual, aroused. Benevolent fingers carded through his hair at the uttered praise, and John could feel the unease seep from the lines of his body, along with Sherlock as he pulled away. "I've one more request." A pause. "While you are not allowed to speak, I would also advise you not to muffle any noise you may want to make. I want to hear it all." The words were breathy and filled with so much meaning, the implications sent shards of want stabbing through John's gut.
The man jumped up, turning to Sherlock defiantly, pointing a stiff, bony finger at John accusingly. "You're mad if you're going to allow him to stay here. He's got trouble written all over him!"
Holmes leant forward. His eyes flashed, frosted over and preternaturally pale from the light pouring through the windows. "Not
During their trip through Tesco, Sherlock kept up a running narrative on his disapproval of John's choice of shopping locale and how tedious it all was. "Of course I understand the convenience of the location, but really, John, how can you stand doing this so often? I would like to say I've never been amongst such a high level of stupidity in my life, but that wouldn't be completely honest. I suffer more than enough fools at the Yard as it is."
Lady Grey leant up on her toes, her hands on either side of his neck to steady herself as she pressed her lips against Sherlock’s ear. “I wouldn’t say a devil, Mr Holmes, but I’m definitely not on the side of the angels.” Then, she pulled back slightly to place a lingering kiss on his cheek.
Lestrade rolled his eyes and crossed his arms over his chest in a long suffering gesture that indicated the man was very familiar with, and unfortunately, used to dealing with Sherlock. "You tell that bloody bastard I wouldn't be here if he'd bother to answer his damned phone!"
Even then, John felt his body demanding the attention Sherlock had so lavishly paid it, taut and strained with need, burning as he thought of all the ways the man made him reach the pinnacle, only to always bring him back down.
Pulling his phone out, Sherlock tapped open his gallery and sent a photo to Murray's phone, tucking it away again only when he heard the accompanying buzz of his companion's device. Murray unlocked his phone and tapped on the screen, before flicking his eyes up to Sherlock, this time in honest bemusement.
John's resolve melted like butter at Sherlock's tempting words and decadent tone, the skim of his lips atop the underside of John's erection.  John felt wanton and hot, wanted Sherlock to lay him down and split his thighs, sink his filthy tongue inside of him. "Sh-Sherlock," he groaned, resisting the urge to dig his fingers in that crown of curls and pull.
John finds himself on the bad side of the pack alpha, and possibly, a new ally to help him through this strange situation.
John, an intimidating, steady presence, only watched until the air was thick enough to suffocate them both. "Are you sure this is what you want?"
John leaned into it, his lids fluttering shut as Sherlock pulled him close enough to spot the flecks of hazel in his irises.
His stomach was empty and his body was sore; John couldn't think of a better idea than turning a trick or two for a bit of cash, and buying himself some hot food.
John smiled, recognizing an olive branch when he was offered one. "I'm in Sutton," he stated, not sure why he'd offered that piece of information when it hadn't come up to begin with.
At Sherlock's raised brow, John paced a slow, disconcerting half circle around the room as he began to speak. "Fortunately for me, I did my research before I came." Sherlock found the draw of his eyes to John's broad upper back, irresistible, the bunch of his muscles as he walked with his hands folded behind him. "Sherlock Holmes, the 'Great Alpha Tamer'."
Mrs Hudson’s door was firmly closed, unusually quiet, before Sherlock remembered that it was her Ladies Night with Ms Turner and Mrs Margaret from three doors down, who owned a novelty bookshop Sherlock occasionally frequented.
In their battle for dominance, Sherlock ended up trapped on his back and pinned between John’s legs, the length of his long cock resting snug and hard amid John’s arse cheeks.
John thought contemptuously. He really was tired of all the vague statements and layers of hidden meanings. For once, could one of these people just be direct? John had better things to be doing with his mind than running mental laps around something ambiguous Sherlock may have said.
With a heavy sigh, John left the window, allowing the curtain to fall back into place before he was off gathering his things and stuffing them into his backpack. Before he left, John did one last thing. He’d written letters to both Jasper and Sherlock. He left Jasper’s on his bed where his friend would see it when he returned, and Sherlock's where only he could find it.
“Mostly everything,” Sherlock confirmed, sliding a glass over the table towards him. He nodded at it. “Cabernet.”
Victor stood, and Sherlock did too, coming to stand before his friend. Victor took both Sherlock's hands and held them between his own. “You are my dearest friend, Sherlock, and I couldn't be happier for you.” Victor leaned forward and kissed his cheek, and Sherlock felt like that fumbling teenager all over again, without a place in the world, but one friend who knew him better than anyone else.
Besides the adrenaline and the fear, John couldn't remember much past the blood and the tinnitus as he attempted to staunch the blood flow of his First Lieutenant, Bill Murray. The sun was beating down on his back and all around him, bullet shells rained down like hail, hot against his skin. Beneath his hands, Murray’s pulse fluttered dangerously, and John attempted to steady his hands as he pulled the fragmented bullet from Murray’s side.
Sherlock rolled his eyes, finally breaking the stare. "It would be foolish of me to do such a thing, John. I'm merely curious as to how you would answer such an enquiry, considering that our arrangement is unconventional."
Jasper stared up at the ceiling, smoke drifting up in a lazy dance as he let the fag dangle lazily between his middle and index finger. "I dunno. I figured I might take a gap year, y'know. Do some traveling, maybe. I love London, but I don't plan to be stuck here forever. Dad loves it... Says he'll never leave, but I know there's more for me out there."
Sherlock closed the tiny gap of space between them and pressed himself up beside John, before he leaned down to whisper in his ear. “When this is over, I'm going to take you home. You will not stop for tea; you will go straight to my room, strip, and then you're going to sit on my face while I eat your arse until you come. Am I understood?”
Julia sniffled and folded further into the couch, arms crossed over her chest as she pointedly glared straight ahead.
He squeezed his eyes shut as his orgasm rippled through him like an earthquake, rattling every bone in his body, every thought in his head. All he could feel was a mindless downward spiral, the long plunge into a depthless crevasse. His shout echoed in the tiny room and beneath him, John’s muscles locked and relaxed in powerful spasms.
Sherlock shot him a look that loudly proclaimed how idiotic of a question he thought that was. "Because you wouldn't be here, still, otherwise."
Mrs Hudson huffed and crossed her arms. "Well it won't be alright if you stumble and break your neck being a stubborn young man. Here, give me that child, Sherlock." She walked up the steps and gently pulled John out of Sherlock's grasp, cooing softly at him. "Look at you, all wrapped up. Such a precious little thing."
It was a chilly night, but Sherlock couldn't feel it as he stepped outside the hospital, could only tell by the billow of steam when he exhaled.
Immediately, John could see the shutters come down, and Sherlock's lips press into a firm line as his face became a blank canvas, effectively severing whatever moment they were having. "Yes," he stated. Turning, he followed Lestrade into the lift, "I'll have my driver bring me there. I'm not riding in your police..."
Sherlock paused to contemplate the length of the chain that held the bar, before he knelt down place both hands on the back of John's calf. "This will require some upper body strength, John, do you think you can handle it?"
Jasper continued on, wincing as his shoes crunched loudly over broken glass. For a moment, he froze as did the other noise in the building. They had heard.
Sherlock's eyes lingered on John's lips as he pulled the glass away, licking away the drops of champagne that escaped the rim.
Afterward, Greg rarely ever brought Mina to the flat, and whenever he did, he couldn't help but notice the way her eyes would flicker noticeably to and away from his flatmates. While John would at least make an effort to make Greg’s girlfriend comfortable, Sherlock had no such compunction.
John gaped silently, at a loss for words, not really wanting to know how Sherlock could tell, but amazed at the ability that he could relay exactly how if John simply asked. "Y-yes, but I'll understand if you don't want me here. I don't want to impose."
A moment later, the brunet turned on his heel and strode to the door, but not before John had seen a flicker of a shadow fall over Sherlock's alien features. When he turned back to John at the door, his face had gone curiously blank.
Jointly, the pace sped up and soon, their grunts and moans were the only sound that rang out in the woods. John's hands clung to Sherlock's on his waist as he used his body strength to bring them to a fantastic finish.
As he passed the bed, John ran a hand across the sheets, the silk nestling between his fingers like liquid. He longed to lay upon it. The wood was smooth to the touch, perfectly even and probably worth more than the sum of all that he owned.
John was consuming him, and the sounds were nearly as delicious as the display. Sherlock's body was wracked with shudders while he stared helplessly as John swallowed his juices straight from the source. The smack of John's lips should have been lewd, but Sherlock only pushed up into it, watching John watch him. There was something so predatory and primal there that Sherlock didn't often see. This Alpha craved danger and debauchery just as much as Sherlock, and to find his equal was as promising as it was frightening. What if he left, and Sherlock was never to see him again? Would anyone ever intrigue him as John Watson had?
Sherlock was gorgeous in his midnight ensemble, and though they’d only had one another not more than an hour ago, John found himself wanting to ruffle Sherlock's neatly combed curls and pull him down.
His brows furrowed in confusion at this, wondering why everything with Sherlock Holmes had to be so cryptic. '
Did he really want to work for someone he would eventually have a sexual relationship with? Holmes made it very clear what his intentions towards John were, and while the job hadn't been offered implicitly with sex in mind, he knew now what his employer wanted from him besides a personal assistant.
Sherlock ran a finger over his lip absently, his eyes flicking back to John, who’d turned to face him again. For a moment, the intensity of their stare held true, and everything faded away in monotonous colours until the only thing that stood out was the deep, oceanic blue of John's eyes.
John growled in a moment of pure frustration, running both of his hands roughly through his unkempt hair. "Sherlock. No," he shook his head and looked up at the man across from him. "No, you're not going to do this right now. You're not going to turn
Sherlock didn't look up, kept his eyes on his partner, the only one he had eyes for. If John was himself, he would have teased him for being sentimental and then Sherlock would have kissed him because he could. It pained him that he couldn't.
Sherlock pushed off the wall and walked to where Molly held John protectively against her chest, reaching one hand out tentatively to smooth down the errant strands of John's thin hair.
Sherlock pressed impossibly closer, his hips snapping against John's with an obscene squelch. It was gloriously filthy, and John craved for more of it, wanted to feel the blood racing through his veins and Sherlock's heart beating just as erratically in his chest.
A dark haired man with long, angular features and a sharp nose held upwards pompously, sneered in disagreement. "No way, isn't this the bloke that lead those bloody hunters straight to the den?"
Mycroft wanted an answer, immediately, a 'yes' or 'no' would suffice, but John couldn't give it to him; not like this, not in his scattered state of mind.
“Brother,” Mycroft said, and gestured towards the unoccupied seat beside Jasper. “Join us, will you?”
Sherlock rose to retrieve the medical kit from the bedroom and returned to see Lestrade shrugging on his coat.
A small hand came to rest on his fingers, and John realized that they'd been trembling around the edges of the paper. "John, are you alright?"
With the grace and inhuman speed of a practiced predator, his captor had a hand wrapped around the smaller man's throat, cutting off the air through his trachea, and effectively silencing him. “I said don't...talk.” between words, the hand continued to constrict John's throat in a hold far stronger than the man looked to be. “More hunters will come looking for you, and you've led them straight to me.” The man watched him with a warning , and John recognized it, nodding as best as he could while his throat was being held hostage. The stranger slowly released him, standing and taking a step back as he nonchalantly brushed non-existent lint off of his immaculate suit. He gazed down imperiously at the chained man, running a hand through the curls on his forehead. “Against my better judgment, I will allow you a day to recover, and after, you must leave; take yourself and your trouble elsewhere that won't cause my pack to suffer the same fate as yours.”
John waited as Lestrade turned into a door at the end of the hall and listened as he rummaged around muttering to himself under his breath. He took the time to look around while the other man looked for clothes, taking in the garish green wallpaper and the unpolished wood flooring. The hallway had an old Victorian feel to it that John wondered if the rest of the house mirrored.
When he stepped through the door, his dad was lying on the couch, long limbs pointed down to the toes and pushed into the arm cushion. It was such an ordinary display that Jasper could almost forget the past month even happened. He couldn't help the sigh of relief at the sight. John was nowhere to be seen.
The man John guessed was Victor, who had been quiet up until that point stood and placed a calming hand on Sherlock's shoulder. "No one is challenging you Sherlock, we are all just worried."
John backed out of that thread and scrolled to the unread text, unsure why he was so nervous to read it.
His reflection was ugly and dissatisfying to the eye. John's large, unsightly nose was not broken, thank heavens, but it was red and puffy, not taking into account the dried blood circling around the rim, and trailing lazily down his philtrum.
What was worse, Moriarty had been correct. He would have released the pictures, the tapes, all of it, and Sherlock would have lost everything. Then, eventually, Sherlock would come to resent John, to hate him for being the exception, for being the blinders. Sherlock would hate him for being a distraction, for making him
John smiled, though wondered if he should be alarmed by that confession. Ordinary people didn't just follow random strangers unless they had it out for them, but then again, this man was turning out to be anything but ordinary.
There was no sign of his clothes on the bed or the floor, so with mounting irritability, John pulled the sheet off the bed and wrapped it around his shoulders before stepping out into the hallway.
The words played over and over, and even though John was sure that Jim had been trying to rile him up, it didn't take the sting out of his words. The statement rang true. He might be in Sherlock's life now, but eventually he would get bored and John would become another notch on Sherlock's belt.
Were it anyone else, Sherlock would have sneered at them, called them weak, and he didn’t have to wonder that it was exactly what Mycroft thought of him.
Sarah had gone quiet and John looked up curiously to see her staring in horror at something over his shoulder.
“No need. I have the perfect place in mind, already.” Pause. “I knew such a day would come, eventually.”
John shivered at his words, a full body tremble that made his bones quake. Sherlock was doing him in with his words alone, but John was as close to heaven as he was ever going to get with Sherlock's fingers prodding relentlessly against his prostate.
The sharp snap of twigs brought John back to the present, looking up to see Sherlock flitting around almost manically, his eyes wild as they took in everything. Sherlock was a man possessed, afraid of missing something, though John didn't see much of anything. Anything of note to be found would be inside the house.
Sherlock had cornered John near his shared bedsit and demanded an explanation while John growled at him to keep his voice down. Sherlock scoffed at that and John had promptly dragged him back to his bedsit where it was obvious he’d been alone.
Sherlock grabbed the pillow and threw it off, the bed, smiling as he wrapped a hand around John’s waist and pulled him forward. “Humility is boring,” he stated, low and gravelly as John’s leg slung over his hip. “Humility didn’t win me a certain wager.”
Sherlock rolled his eyes, letting his head drop against the back of the chair. “Meaning, no court in London will convict Jim Moriarty. While I’m sure whatever he’s returned for means nothing good for Scotland Yard and your workload, it would be a waste of my time to pursue him.”
He shifted to release some of the pressure in his trousers and licked his lips, watching with a jolt of thrill as Sherlock's predatory gaze followed the motion. Then, grey eyes slid up to meet John's stare full on. “My dear John, to bottom doesn't mean to submit. It simply means that I'll have had you in every way possible.”
“Obviously,” the man snorted sotto voce, and John's head shot up to give the man another once over. That was surprisingly rude. Aren't vicars supposed to be patient and gentle, or something? But the man had turned and was no longer looking at him. All John could see was the shrouded black of the man’s cassock and his long pale neck as he leaned his head back against the wall.
Sherlock swallowed and nodded, afraid to speak as John grabbed the rail of the staircase with both hands and took each step down slowly. Sherlock stood on the landing until Mrs Hudson had ushered John safely inside her flat and closed the door.
Sherlock slowed to match strides with John, his eyes squinted as he looked into the distance, guarded and alert. “I've most of England memorized,” he stated, though not arrogantly. “Mycroft used to take me around, mostly when we were younger, and occasionally when we were teenagers. He showed me how to mark places with my scent and use landmarks to find my way.
Sherlock relaxed in increments, until he came to rest his head over John's, and his arms around the smaller male's shoulders. John's heart was beating a crescendo in his chest at the intimacy of the hold. Two hurting hearts pressed against one another through layers of fabric, beating the same song of longing and sadness and hope, and faith.
Somehow they ended up settling down on the roof of Bart’s, swinging their legs over the edge as they watched life go by beneath their feet. It was the first place Sherlock had gone to look for Jasper the night he left, because they frequented it most often after an argument with one another, or just to be alone. It was familiar, and held many memories for the both of them, and now for Sherlock, it would be where he spent John's final hours in London.
His fingers are already tingling with the need to feel tender, young skin beneath them. Sherlock pushes John down to the ground from behind, hearing the younger male grunt in pain and surprise. It invigorates him, makes Sherlock crave for more of those breathless noises.
Sherlock wrapped the rope around John's wrists until there was a foot of length left to hold. Sherlock took this and wrapped it around his own fist like a lead.
“Because they’ll think you’re barmy, you nutter,” John laughed, scooting an inch closer to Sherlock as a draft passed through the room from the open window. “Most people don’t see things the way you do, genius.”
was John's first thought upon opening his eyes. Everything was encompassed in a thick darkness and the pounding in his head was nauseating. His tongue was thick with the flavour of stale ale, rancid breath and a terrible night's sleep.
“God, yes,” John trembled, hands quivering on Sherlock’s biceps. He reached down and grasped Sherlock’s erection, gave a few slow tugs. John snickered as Sherlock growled into the underside of his jaw, though nearly choked on his amusement when a clever mouth nipped it’s way up to his ear.
Later, Sherlock took John the long route to his bedsit and promised to see him off at the train station. Mycroft had obviously bypassed the prerequisites to procure a cadetship for John, so he would be reporting straight to the RMAS in Camberley for training.
The man himself chose that moment to reveal himself, all bespoke and lean lines. John could feel his eyebrows threatening to reach his hairline, so he turned and made himself busy with preparing the tea. "Jasper, your grammar is atrocious. Every time you talk, it's like someone's taking a cheese grater to my brain."
Sherlock reached behind him to grab the soap that sat in the corner of the bath, pouring some onto a sponge. He pulled John's fingers to his lips, kissing his them softly before he began to rub the sponge over his skin. It was so tender, so unexpected, but John welcomed it. A part of him rebelled at being handled as if he were breakable, like some fragile thing, but it wasn't often that he was treated that way at all. Although John had assumed a submissive role in their dynamic, Sherlock appreciated that he was still a man and to compromise that would be to lose John.
Then, his eyes darkened, and Sherlock was reaching under the pillow and returned with cotton rope. There was nothing elaborate this time. John was on the verge of madness and the dangerous glint in Sherlock's eyes was enough to speed up John's pulse.
It wasn’t often that John left the club as Lady Grey, but when he did, some part of him still cringed away from the possibility that he could be recognised, or that someone would notice and say something. He’d been privy to a few hurled insults in passing, and a scathing look or two, but never anything outright violent. John was still a fighter, and with the way Sherlock stood close to him as they walked, he knew that no one would be brazen enough to say a word.
John was panting, his shoulders rising and falling, and Sherlock's eyes were flitting between his lips and eyes, his expression, an unpredictable tempest. "Then why am I here," John asked in one quivering breath.
John didn't know why Sherlock was telling him these things, and he felt breathless with the knowledge he was receiving. Sherlock's hand was still trapped under his own hand, but not strong enough that it couldn't be moved if the owner wanted to.
“Get your shirt off,” Sherlock demanded, shifting just enough to allow John room to comply. John didn’t hesitate, pulling his jumper and shirt over his head and tossing them out of the way.
“Why didn’t you move back in with Stamford? I’m sure he would have readily accepted you,” Sherlock drawled, his eyes circling the room with poorly hidden contempt. “But this…”
He was stunning like this, prepossessing in his submissiveness and Sherlock was suddenly nervous to bugger it all up. He spent the years between John’s absence wading in drugs and worshipping little false gods with blond hair and blue eyes, such ordinary features that it should have been easy to find another. Now, he was kneeling behind the only divine being he’d ever put his faith in and could hardly bring himself to move.
When John awoke, the room was pitched in complete darkness, and his body ached from his prone position on the floor. He sat up slowly, rubbing at his sore neck as he remembered his sister's assault. John's phone dug into his arse from his back pocket, and he reached back to pull it out. 18:31.
Sherlock wrapped his arms around his legs and pulled them to his chest, straining his neck to see past the ceiling of the inlet and up at the sky. It was mute grey and moonless, covered completely by a giant cumulonimbus cloud that pelted the ground with sheets of water. The rock formation was on higher ground, so at least they weren't at risk of being flooded out, but all the same, it was important to be watchful.
At first, Greg had thought it was odd. When they’d met, John was dating a lovely bird named Sarah, yet he’d walk into the flat only to see John and Sherlock snuggling on the couch like a couple of lovebirds. It used to confuse Greg a bit, but then he’d moved in and it thoroughly scrambled him.
“Keep your leg round my waist,” Sherlock ordered and let go. He smiled, pleased when John obeyed. With his free hand, he reached down to spread him further.
John's words were muffled, as if he were talking through a door, and all that Sherlock could bring himself to notice was the way John's eyes crinkled around the edges in distress and the near compulsive clench of John's fists, tightening and releasing, only to repeat the process.
His fifth year, John was promoted to captain and he eased into the position with as much ease as he did his place in the army. At that time, there was an increase in insurgents and ambushes, so firefights were more likely to break out, and the patrols became increasingly dangerous.
Sherlock’s pen hovered briefly over paper as an image of Mycroft came to him, unbidden, tall and chubby with a head full of hair he could only wish for now. He’d been young but the stress of keeping the secret of a drug-addled little brother from their parents showed in the newly-formed lines appearing across his forehead.
"Yes, John, Molly should be waiting for us here. I know you're always nagging me to text her ahead of time, even if it doesn't do much good. I've already memorized her schedule years ago."
The man’s pale eyes absorbed all the light in the room until they appeared to be shifting colours as he moved. For a moment, his eyes darkened as they traversed possessively over John's splayed form. “You don’t do this often.” John couldn’t tell if Sherlock was asking or stating what he assumed, but he answered anyway.
Jasper didn't wait for anything else. He turned and walked calmly up the stairs to his room that smelled like dust and not like John. His bed was still disheveled from the night he’d left, though Jasper could tell his father had been in his room. The Pussy Riot poster on his wall was skewed and his pillow was more rumpled than usual. In the middle of the bed, there was an envelope still sealed with John's messy scrawl on the front. He would recognize that writing anywhere.
The man was tall and resplendent in a black, wool Belstaff coat that lengthened and flattered an already long, graceful form. Dark, brown curls framed a pale face and the sharpest set of cheekbones John ever had the pleasure of laying eyes on. What John found peculiar, however, were the slanted, opalescent eyes currently flickering over his person with keen interest. The man's sumptuous lips were pursed in a prim line and his expression was otherwise unreadable.
Sherlock took his time crossing the room as he spoke, and picked up the padded leather chair in the corner of the room, the one he distinctly remembered sitting in as he took John over his knees for the first time. He sat it in the middle of the room, biting down on his smile as John swallowed but kept his gaze steady.
Clamping down furiously on those thoughts, Sherlock smiled tightly at John and simply raised a brow in slight amusement. If John were like every other Alpha, the wordless insult would render him angry and useless. Alphas never thought with their brains, merely allowed instincts to rule them. To Sherlock, it both made his job easier and frustratingly mundane.
If he was honest with himself, John hadn’t expected much to come from his dinner date with Sherlock Holmes. The man’s reputation preceded him, and John wasn’t sure he was down to the task of entering into any type of relationship with a prima donna. Not to say that that wasn’t what Sherlock was. He could most certainly throw a fit if things didn’t go his way, but the benefits of his more attractive qualities out-weighed the risks, and John never regretted his decision.
John finally got up the nerve to knock, and leaned forward, rapping on the door sharply. After a minute of no answer, he rang the bell, hearing no signs of life from inside. He backed away looking up at the first storey window. John swore under his breath at seeing it dark and uninhabited, wishing he had thought to call before assuming he could just come round.
Lestrade cleared his throat, fidgeting with his gloves as he watched Sherlock read the headline. “He was spotted a few blocks from your building, leaving a Starbucks with that fellow who worked for you, Sebastian Wilkes.”
A quick call summoned a cab to the kerb, and Sherlock slid in, waving the cabbie back into the driver’s seat when he’d made to go around and get the door. He had a few black cabs on payroll in the case of expedience. He had to say, it was much safer than one of Moriarty's spies carting him around London.
When they'd reached the Marylebone district, Sherlock shook him awake, wiping a bit of drool from the side of his lips with a careful thumb. When the car finally pulled round to a four-storey flat building on Baker Street, John was wide awake.
The first thing Irene said was: “You don’t belong in a place like this, darling, but I have a better alternative.”
Sherlock ran his hands through his hair in frustration, pacing across the lounge room with long, crisp steps, while he gesticulated wildly with his hands. “John's pack was ambushed by the hunters, and in turn, he was left alive in order to lead them to the next closest pack. Using his biological imperative, they followed, or rather, herded him to my territory, though we can't be sure if they've discovered our exact coordinates.”
John was staring at him cautiously from beneath furrowed brows, eyes still bleary from sleep, right cheek streaked with pillow lines and temptingly rumpled. It was impossible not to drink him in. Whenever it came to John, Sherlock found his self-control flying out the window along with any feelings of animosity he harboured when not in the younger man’s presence.
Jasper pouted, slumping on the couch in seeming exhaustion. "They were out of those little biscuits I like." Jasper pouted, falling into his customary sulk as he was wont to do when he didn't get his way.
John dropped his bag on the floor, frowning. No mum, no Harry; the bedsit was as lonely as lonely could get.
The man stopped in the centre of the room and turned, crossing his arms and smiling in a way he thought might be seductive. Sherlock already missed John's bashful, self-deprecating smirk. The man opened his mouth to speak but Sherlock swiftly cut in, not wanting to ruin this illusion any further. “Don't talk.”
The third round of play was more sensuous than the first and second, slow and exquisite. This time, John was properly tied, his arms and legs tugged on either side of him and tied to the bedposts. Sherlock brandished the riding crop like an extended appendage of himself, his eyes alight with something more than lust. The first two times were only the beginning, John had come to understand, something to whet Sherlock's appetite, but this…
This time, John’s steady gaze didn’t so much as flicker, though the corners of his eyes tightened the tiniest bit.
John chewed thoughtfully for a moment, turning Sherlock's words over in his head. It seemed a bit weird, then, that Sherlock would offer John a job that plenty of qualified people were knocking down his door for. "Well, what do you need me for, then? I mean, I've never had a job like this before. Wouldn't you want someone more... I don't know, proficient in that area?"
John sighed before turning away from the window and walking back to the couch. He laid down and closed his eyes in hopes of sleep coming to take him again.
Sherlock nodded, entranced by eyes too wise to be anything but John's, looking up at him with so much trust.
When John reached approximately twenty-eight to thirty years of age, the cell replication began to slow, and John recalled snippets of his time in Afghanistan.
As much as John tried to hide his attraction, Sherlock didn't miss a thing, and that included the heavy-lidded stares when Sherlock said something suggestive... so he began to say more.
Sherlock didn’t know why he brought John there. All he’d known was that a world without John Watson would be one without Sherlock Holmes, too.
The woman on the track groaned, and Sherlock was completely enraptured as Lady Grey’s expression seemed to falter for a moment, breaking her character as vixen as she appeared to pant a little. Sherlock hoped that he was affecting her as much as she was him.
“I don’t have time for this, Mycroft. Tell me: You have your finger in every pie, so do your job and tell me what I’m up against.”
Now that he was sober, everything he hadn't noticed about the flat upon arrival, was greedily taken in, along with a flood of new information about his employer.
Stamford watched him, he knew, but Sherlock couldn’t take his eyes off the display. There were three stages, each of them showing a different scene. In the middle, a group of showgirls twirled around the stage in unison, their heads held high and posture perfect, even with the added weight of the large, feathered headdress. Which, frankly, was not at all flattering. On the second stage, a woman in a mask walked a man on a chain, pulling as he got close to the edge of the stage. In her other hand was a whip she used to tap him lightly on the back.
Sherlock retrieved the plug and lathered it with lubricant before placing it at John’s entrance, waiting until he was completely still, then pushed it inside in one slow slide. After inserting the plug until only the curved, horizontal handle protruded, Sherlock sat back to survey his submissive.
Like a hound with a scent, his mother sat straight up and crossed her legs, leaning forward to stare directly into John's eyes with intense scrutiny. "No, my Johnny wouldn't do that." She was completely serious, and John sank back into his chair and slid down, seeing no way out of this.
Victor smiled softly, leaning forward to place a hand briefly on Sherlock’s knee. “Of course. You know she still comes to me for custom gowns and the like. She’s good for business.” Victor paused to mull over his words before continuing. “She says she hasn’t heard from you since your John showed up out of the blue. I got a bit worried…”
He hung up and paused at the door, turning as if he had forgotten that John was there. With some awe and what looked like relief, Sherlock said, “Jasper is with Mycroft.”
The question snapped Sherlock out of whatever sentimental haze he’d begun to fall into, and like a brick snapping from a rope, the pain of every last year without John came crashing down upon his head until all he saw was red.
John, understanding her concern, flashed her a reassuring smile. "Don't worry, Sarah. He might be a prat, but I've dealt with worse." And he had. When he was younger, school hadn’t always been the easiest to get through, and teenagers could be cruel. "I can hold my own against him."
John smiled and nodded, crossing his arms as he leaned against the window and turned his eyes to the empty street below. "I'm okay, Mr. Holmes. I don't sleep much through the night anymore."
Sherlock conceded with a reluctant agreement. “Alright,” he said, licking his lips. “That seems… fair. Meet me tomorrow then. We’ll talk over coffee as I do intend to work with you again in future if you would agree.”
"And do be careful. Office romances can be tricky things. Believe me, before I met your mum, I was a bit of a slag in my day!"
Mike coughed again, a tad louder away from the receiver, before he spoke again, short of breath. "I know you have a lot on your plate right now, but I need a huge favor."
They lay in bed afterward, spent and lying over sweat-soaked bed sheets. Cool air dried the pearly beads of perspiration on their skin until John reached over and pulled the cover over their naked bodies.
“Well we know who's behind this, Sherlock, there's no need to recklessly put yourself in harm's way for information we already have,” Mycroft reasoned, the crack in his composure only growing more strained the more that he learned of the situation.
who was gracious enough to help me make this a better story. I hope that you all enjoy this new chapter and also, the Sherlock Special, then after we can have a Johnlock hell after party together :)
“Stunning,” Sherlock murmured to himself, sliding his hand into his pocket where the remote lay in wait. For a moment, he simply watched John’s ribcage expand with each breath. It was proof enough that this wasn’t all in Sherlock’s mind, that John was real and tangible; not just a vivid dream that would disintegrate the moment Sherlock decided to believe it.
John looked past Lestrade and to the door again, feeling a bit more wary the closer it came time to meet the rest of the wolves.
Sherlock traced the line of a vein in John's neck, following the pale thread up until it led over his chin, to soft, supple lips. John would want to be active duty; he enjoyed the challenge, wanted the excitement, which would mean Afghanistan or Iraq. Sherlock tried to picture John's likely transformation after time in the sun. He pictured an older John, weathered from the sun, how his blue eyes would stand out against his tan skin, the sturdiness of his form after days of running, training. Sherlock hoped that one day he would be able to see this John, alive and well, even if it had to be from a distance.
Sherlock nodded, unable to tear his eyes away as John lifted the wooden spoon and blew on the sauce before testing it. Watching his pink tongue dart out to lick away the remnants made his limbs feel weak and loose and his breath stutter in his throat.
John smiled up at his father fondly, and dropped into the passenger seat, stretching out his legs as he reclined. It was comforting to have a conversation with someone other than Sherlock; no sexual charge and flirtatious innuendos to keep pace with.
Yes, John had met many men like Victor, and he could spot one just as quick. Everything in John was repelled by the man; all John needed to know about him was apparent in that last moment between them in the lounge, as Victor sat smiling smugly in the midst of ensuing chaos, like the cat who ate the canary.
The was mildly surprised at the wild surge of jealousy at the sight of them together caught John off guard. His stomach plummeted unpleasantly and his breath to caught in his throat.
When he disembarked, his father politely said his goodbyes to the stranger and quickly walked over, beaming all the way.
Before he could go further, John stood and shoved his hands in his pockets, avoiding Sherlock's eyes. "Look, Sherlock, just- don't. I'll spare you the time and just-," John turned halfway as if to leave and hesitated. "Listen, I wanted to apologize, for not telling you about the-" John gestured to the coffee table where the image of Jim's bruised back glared up at him, pale and barbaric. Sherlock had done that to him because it was what he liked, and because it was also what Jim liked. "I think it's- it's entirely appropriate that you made this decision. I mean I-"
Sherlock stubbed out his cigarette and retreated to the loo to clean up. He donned his suit and grabbed his phone and wallet, keys, then left the room.
"Yeah," John finally replied, flinching at the surge of emotions he was struggling to keep down. "Yes, I'll be fine."
“Agh!” Holmes gasped, blinking hard as he opened his eyes, the long, pale column of his throat bared.
John scratched his tousled, blond head as he looked at the little torn off scrap of paper where Jasper's spidery letters described the way almost illegibly. "221B Baker Street," he read aloud to himself. John looked up at the building, eyes wondering to the first floor, where the curtain was just fluttering closed.
The lump under the sheet shifted, pulling the covers down as he rolled onto his stomach. John’s back still shone damp with sweat, tiny, shimmering beads that traversed down the nape of his neck and followed the curve of his spine. Sherlock could still see the imprint of his hand stamped across John’s hips.
John tore his eyes away, unable to hold Sherlock's stare for long. It was like looking into a well; no matter how hard you would squint, you could never quite see to the bottom. Those eyes were deep and depthless, and the potential to fall in was ridiculously imaginable.
Then again, there was nothing truly petty about the situation. He’d become disassociated with who he truly was, forgotten that there was a life outside of Lady Grey and the Looking Glass.
John bucked his hips in a pleading gesture, but with a swift, “Down,” from Sherlock, he settled for squirming.
“Yeah,” John breathed, meeting Sherlock’s hooded stare beneath the fringe of his pale lashes. His moan fractured against Sherlock’s lips. “I like it, too.”
John’s eyes flicked down, then up again, dark and heavy-lidded. “What do you want?” He asked, swallowing.
“You trust me,” John blurted, but it was already out and he wasn't going to recall the statement. Just last night they’d established that there was more between them, but it didn't implicitly encompass trust. Of course with their bedroom activities, there had to be some level of trust between them, but John hadn't known it extended to Sherlock's end.
For John, it had been a great loss, and the final thing to push him to cut all ties to London and his life before. He’d just been trying to hang on when it was inevitable that sooner or later, life would intercede and they would both have to move on.
John’s held lolled against his shoulder, mouth wide open, so Sherlock made good use of it. John clamped his lips over Sherlock’s fingers readily, sucking them in until the tips nearly touched the back of his throat. He gagged messily, saliva running down his chin as Sherlock hooked two fingers on the back of his tongue.
Every Alpha had a weakness, an issue that Sherlock could press until it gave way for compromise and logical thinking. For most, it was love or money, sometimes both, but one was always greater than the other. For Sherlock's previous client, Sebastian Wilkes, his weakness was money. Wilkes would do anything to stay wealthy and in a position of power. No matter how bruised Wilkes' ego over his stolen Omega, no one cared for a tyrant. All Sherlock needed to do was pinpoint that fear and expound on it. Sherlock's job was to cut through the feral aspect of an untamed Alpha and hit the pressure points. Wilkes had to understand that either he would get over his former Omega and move on, or he would lose his company.
Abruptly, Sherlock pulled back, breathing hard as he ran a hand through his slick curls. John was a mess before him, laid out indecorously, and probably blushing from head to toe. Without breaking their connection, Sherlock leant over and pulled his drawer out. He must’ve known precisely where everything was placed, because he didn’t even have to rummage around before his hand emerged wrapped tight around a tube of lubricant.
The room was filled with a symphony of groans and full throated growls that rattled the windows, parodies of thunder, and just as powerful.
Mike had asked that question no less than four times since they'd joined him in the kitchen, and Sherlock grimaced into his tea from where he leaned against the counter, trying hard not to deduce Mike to within an inch of his life. John could see his lip twitch, on the edge of spewing out something venomous every time that Mike repeated himself.
Sherlock’s stomach trembled excitedly as he leaned back, memorizing the slick shine of his saliva coating John’s neck and chest, the red indent of his fingers, barely visible above John’s waistband, and the coral hue of his bitten lips.
The lump of flesh on John's back emitted a soft groan and rolled away, allowing the crisp air to settle sharply on his skin. The sweat rapidly chilled and John sighed into his pillow. Better.
The crowd wasn't as dense as it would be on a weekend, but the atmosphere was thick with loneliness, and sorry souls drinking away their woes. John found himself despicably satisfied that he wasn't the only one there feeling woefully inadequate to continue the day without some form of self-medicating.
Feedback is always encouraged. I would love to hear what you think of the new chapter! Until next time, my friends.
John kept thinking of the dark figures of the hunters, so close to their victory. If Sherlock had decided to stay another night, they would be ashes in their beds, with no way to warn the others what was coming. It was frightening, and made John realize how close he'd come to death for the second time.
Lestrade swore and swept out the room behind the medics, leaving Sherlock alone with forensics, taking pictures of Förstner's cooling body. Unfortunately, John's gun had been bagged as evidence.
John scratched the back of his head, fighting his developed tendency to deflect. Sherlock wasn’t planning on relenting, and John didn’t want him to. “Actually, yes, I do,” he replied.
John hadn't expected for Sherlock to want to continue, but the man seemed just as curious about how this odd scene would play out. He wondered how much of it all was affecting Sherlock and whether his cock was pushing against his cassock. It was a vulgar thought, one that John should have been ashamed by, but instead, he found himself wanting to see with his own eyes.
Sherlock wrapped an arm around John's waist and turned them, so that the smaller male was lying docilely beneath him. John allowed his legs to fall open in a prurient display of submission, staring, but keeping his hands obediently at his sides.
Sherlock growled, looking down at John, whose face had grown increasingly more pinched by the minute. Carefully, he handed the infant to Anthea, who cradled him gently against her bosom, and placed the nipple of the bottle against his lips.
Sherlock's gaze had grown shrewd and assessing. It was at the tip of his tongue to say yes, but Sherlock's eyes begged him to think, to stow away his impulse to please and answer honestly.
Sherlock stood back and observed, uncertain as to whether he should remove himself from the room and give John the time needed with his parents, and frozen by the desire to stay near John in case his presence was needed.
He’d brought his cane, which Sherlock nearly sneered at, a small bag of toiletries and a change of clothes along with him, as well as his gun, buried at the bottom of the bag when he thought Sherlock wasn’t paying attention. Why he needed it was anyone’s guess, but Sherlock kept quiet about it and led them out the bedsit with little comment.
John hadn't even noticed the man, but looking at him, he wondered why that was. The newcomer was not at all ordinary, and his presence, alone, sucked up all the air in the room.
John could hear as his friend shifted on the other end of the line and the dry, staticky sound of fabric sliding together. A scraping wheeze emanated from Mike's throat upon each breath. "John, thank God you answered, I thought you'd be dead to the world."
John's eyes flitted from Sherlock's eyes, to his lips and back, unsure what to say. He wasn't anything special. Besides having a lover who had eclectic tastes in the bedroom, he was just a normal bloke. There was nothing fascinating about him. Eventually, Sherlock would get bored-
The tall brunette turned those eyes onto him, and once again, the feeling of being stripped down and cut open made him feel just as uneasy as the first time. John wrapped his arms around his naked body, feeling uncomfortably vulnerable and judged. The taller male followed the movement, eyes predatory in their intensity, and John didn't know if the small spark of excitement he caught was just his imagination.
Sherlock pressed his lips together, thinking it better not to tell Victor to piss off. He was only concerned for Sherlock’s well-being just as Sherlock would be for his if the situation were reversed. It appeared that wherever John was involved, rationality was merely a second thought.
