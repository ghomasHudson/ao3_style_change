Cas meets his gaze, blue eyes still dark, palm brushing over Dean’s jaw, down his arm.  “No,” Cas replies honestly.  “Not until quite recently.  But once I did, it was easy to wait for you.”
Lightheaded, Castiel braces an arm against the bulward and takes in his surroundings.  This ship is smaller than the
Dean huffs, shaking his head.  “Douens just scare me is all.  Everyone’s got their thing.”
Just before midnight, Cas hears his name called and turns to see Sam coming down the corridor.
The douen shrieks indignantly at him, lashing at Castiel’s chest with its good arm.  It knocks him to the side before pivoting on its back-turned toes and disappears at a sprint into the undergrowth.
“No, I didn’t,” Cas says, circling around the counter to stand beside Dean.  “But Sam’s not an idiot, and this is a small bunker.”  He pauses to set his mug down next to the plate of uncooked bacon, then takes Dean’s hand in his and brings it up to brush a kiss onto Dean’s knuckles.  “Does it really upset you that much?”
The last thing Cas can hear is the Empty’s wailing, screeching peals of laughter echoing after them as the portal closes.  A different kind of blackness rushes up from below, ushered in by the blood flowing freely out of Cas’s wound, and Cas sinks into unconsciousness.
had stopped for smoothies just before the Maine border, sighs disapprovingly.  “You’d have been better rested if you let Cas drive,” he chides.  “We have to go talk to the police.  What if the vamps already have another victim strung up somewhere?”
“What?  That’s stupid.”
Another torch appears through the trees, then a second, and a third.  Half a dozen men materialize from the woods, armed with torches and blades.  Patience had followed through on her word and sent the cavalry.
It’s not until Cas is gone that Dean feels the pain.  With silence ringing in his ears and his heart thudding against his ribs, the edges of his vision begin to fade.  Panic is setting in.  It’s cold and hot and shaking and searing and Dean can feel it gripping him from the inside.  His fingertips scrape against the concrete floor, his back pressed against the wall as he desperately tries to ground himself.
He leans to the right, and the Impala’s wheels dip onto the gritty shoulder.  She skids and fishtails, the corner of her trunk clipping the cornstalks.  Gravel peppers her belly like gunshots.  Cas swings her back onto the road before she can completely spin out.
Castiel trails along the shoreline with Ishim and Inias, water skins slung over his shoulder and sweat already beading on the nape of his neck.  The beach is odd — no sand or gravel, only rippling volcanic stone.  The ocean glitters where it laps along the edge, impossibly clear.
empty.
birthdays and anniversaries, and he even drove over for Dean’s first day of preschool last month
Walking beneath the trees, with one hand interlocked with Dean’s and Miracle running ahead, Cas finds no need to fill the space between them with talk.
Abruptly, Cas’s hand snakes behind him and into his jeans, thumbing past the waistband of his boxers in order to grab Dean’s ass bare-skinned.  His fingers dig possessively into the cheek, forcing Dean’s pelvis to buck forward.  Dean sucks an involuntary gasp through gritted teeth, his head falling onto Cas’s shoulder, into the flushed crook of his neck.  He’s glad he didn’t wear shoes this morning, because without them he and Cas are exactly the same height.
Dean tugs on the earring in his left ear, laughing again.  “Well, hunting doesn’t always bring with it silver and gold.  Gotta pay for supplies somehow.”
“I meant about last night.”
wash over him.  Relief, sadness, joy; he has no idea what it is.  But that’s the point.  He needs the space to figure that out.  “You deserve an answer, Cas,” he insists.  “A real answer.  One that I’ve taken the time to consider.”
A smile crosses Cas’s features, outlined in a green glow for a moment before the sign changes back to red.  “That’s true.  You have.”
Eileen raises her eyebrows, glitching into pixels momentarily.  “Am I going to have to separate you two?
“I got three,” Eileen chimes in.
“And?”
Dean looks pleadingly in Cas’s direction, but apparently Cas’s willingness to help him only extends so far.  He lifts his hands and says, “Don’t look at me.  I offered to drive eleven times.”
Cas sits up on the edge of the mattress, reaches out and tugs Dean close.  “I was starting to worry you’d changed your mind,” he confesses, breath ghosting over Dean’s chest.  His palms course up Dean’s sides, along the wings of his ribs.
One of Cas’s hands circles up behind Dean’s head, grips him by the hair, and he pulls out only to slam back in and make Dean nearly bite off his tongue.
“On the
Dean is quick to follow, all too eager to be done with the case for the day.  Exhaustion prickles at the back of his head as they step back out into the frigid air.  The walk back to the Impala is brisk and bracing, and they meet up with Cas and Eileen on the corner of Commercial and Dana.
Jack has disappeared into the bunker archives, frantically tearing through every text the Men of Letters ever compiled, but Dean doesn’t believe he’ll find anything.  Sam remains in the library, combing through the books there in search of a straw to grasp while staying close enough to keep an eye on Dean.  In the evening it’s quiet.  The ringing has finally faded from Dean’s ears and the only thing he can hear is Sam turning a page every few minutes.
me,” Dean growls indignantly, “there’s a booth over there selling peanut butter and jelly cheesecakes, and I’m going to go get one.”  He throws the blueberry-stained napkin at Sam’s face and stands up from the table.
“Even if you go to Hell, you’ll still come back.”  Dean’s voice oozes out of the Empty, a rumbling, starving snarl, and it’s the worst thing Cas has ever heard.  “You are a cockroach.  I need to cut off your head.”
“I just needed a minute.”  It’s the first thing he’s actually said out loud in hours.  He rests his elbows on his knees, feeling gooseflesh course over his skin in the chill.
It’s hard, Dean realizes after Cas’s bedroom door closes behind them, to get undressed without breaking contact.  Even in the brief moments where they have to separate in order to pull shirts over their heads or toe off their shoes, they’re already reaching for each other to close the gap.  Cas’s new shirt and jeans wind up in a pile on the floor, and Dean bursts into an abrupt fit of laughter and buries his face in Cas’s collarbone.
Alastair knifes in and out of him, in every possible direction, from every possible direction.  Tears and spit and snot and blood and bile pour out of him, all mixing together to form whatever’s left of him.  He’s disgusting.  A slithering thing at his own feet.
but good for this world?”
Outside the car, Eileen is trying to reassure Sam, but Cas doesn’t care enough about what she’s saying to listen.
Dean studies him for a moment, then nods and says, “Okay.  You sure you don’t want a snack or something?”
It feels just like their first kiss, all those years ago.
Dizziness washes over him, from a lack of oxygen or sheer adrenaline he has no idea.  Dean pulls Cas closer and then pushes him back against the counter as Cas’s hand traces up his spine.  Goosebumps course over Dean’s skin, radiating outward from Cas’s touch like ripples on a pond.
“Elvis here,” Dean announces grimly, gesturing to a third body.  This one’s neck is ripped to the bone, his trachea gaping in the open air.
A short rope used to tie down a stowed sail to its yard, tied with a quick-release knot to let the sails fly immediately when necessary.
Jack leans over the bowl and slowly inhales the smoke, taking it deep into his lungs.  When he opens his eyes, they’re bright gold again.  He straightens, and as he exhales the veins around his eyes begin to glow, spreading outwards until there’s a virtual spider web of light stretched over his face.
A chuckle bursts out of Cas’s chest and he shrugs in the most human gesture Dean’s ever seen him make.  “It’s a
Dean’s eyes glaze over like they always do when Sam says things like
helping.  “You’re my best friend,” he says, although at this point the term doesn’t even come close to describing them.  “And we owe it to each other to be honest.  Me especially, after everything you’ve done.”
They’re on a wide bridge overlooking a river, the sun still in the east.  Dean worries for a second about leaving the Impala in the road before he remembers that there’s no one else on the planet, nobody left to drive by.  They get out of the car and Cas goes over to the edge, his hands on the railing as he takes in the view.  Dean leans against the rail next to him, propped on his elbows.  Sunlight is glinting off the water as the river rushes beneath the bridge, frothing over the rocks below.  The clouds painted against the sky are feathered and distant.
“Exactly what I thought.”  Paradis snaps his fingers to emphasize his point.  “So, I went through all the security footage from the past year, and this happens at least twice a month.  Always on garbage day.  Except,” he says, leaning forward, “the garbage men usually pick up the black bags.”
He frowns, realization settling cold in his gut.  “Dean?”
“It was twelve,” Cas counters as he leaves a trail of kisses across Dean’s chest, mapping paths from freckle to freckle.
There is a second vehicle in the driveway, another car materialized from nothing.
Castiel’s shoulder prickles where the mermaid bit him.  In truth, he had completely forgotten the injury was even there; he’d been far too focused on hunting the douen and getting Jean-Luc and Feliciana to safety.  It doesn’t hurt any more, not really, though the scabs are just starting to itch now that he’s aware of them again.  “It’s fine,” he answers, returning to cleaning the blood from Dean’s skin.  “I’ve always been a quick healer.”
“How’s
When the sky is just descending into purples and oranges and the lake is turned to wine, Cas sits up straight.  “Sam,” he says.  “Look.”
The coroner nods, and gestures to the wall of cadaver drawers.  “I got five more bodies that look just like this one.  Normally, I’d say this was an animal attack, but the only animals we have in downtown Denver are squirrels and the occasional stray cat.”
of it, all of
of voices, ripping through his skin, organs, atoms.  His eardrums are being torn to shreds by screams.  Men’s.  Women’s.  His own.  An iron poker sizzles in his belly, and his intestines boil.
He reaches up and pulls Cas down into a crushing kiss, wanting nothing more than to chase away the worry.
Cas is forced to focus solely on the creature launching herself at him, and all he can do is hope that Donna and Claire can hold their own.  He swings his machete at the Nachzehrer but she leaps deftly out of the way and slices her claws into the side of his neck, making him yell in pain.  He pulls out his gun to try and slow her and she sinks her teeth into his forearm, forcing him to drop the gun.  In the same instant, he swings his blade under his left arm with his right and manages to catch her in the side.
Cas doesn’t slow down.  “Come on, Dean,” he snarls under his breath.  Protecting the Impala from a head-on collision should be more than enough to shove Dean to this side of the Veil.
Castiel follows, clutching his arm where it still hurts, and descends the steps below deck after Dean.  It’s dim here, lit only by the sunlight streaming down the stairs and a few swaying lanterns.  He stands and lets his eyes adjust while Dean digs through a few crates to his right, toward the stern.  When he turns back around, he hands Castiel a few pieces of dried salted beef and a slightly bruised orange.
Castiel follows Dean’s gaze up, up, up into the recesses of the den, and his blood turns to ice.
“God, you’re just like Dean,” she says with a shake of her head.
Eileen frowns, worry tugging at the back of her head.  “Sam,” she says.  “The Impala’s gone.”
Dean’s not great with his words, and he doesn’t exactly know what to say to that.  But he can feel his soul pulse in his chest, just as surely as his heart, and he knows that Cas doesn’t have to wait any more.  Neither of them do.  Dean understands precisely what Cas means when he talks about being lucky.
Castiel shifts awkwardly, opening his mouth to apologize for eavesdropping.
The rear of the ship.
This realization has only a half second to marinate before a splitting
ship.  She’s quicker and more agile than the
“Well, damn, Cas,” Dean remarks as Cas frustratedly shakes the painful tingle out of his elbow.  “You kiss your mom with that mouth?”
“Are you police?”
you, talking with your mouth full makes it impossible to read your lips.”
The kitchen occupies one entire corner of the cabin
Dean’s arm tightens around him.  “Is that what this is about?” he asks.  “You losing your wings?”
The little girl is crying, panicking, writhing in her bonds as Dean frantically cuts through them.  “I’ll be right behind you!  Tell Frank to burn the den!”
At the base of the palm, a cluster of mussels clings to the wood.  They grow in a knotted mass spread over a large patch of the tree trunk, and despite being easily forty feet from the water they are healthy and alive.  Barnacles dot the trunk as well, little eyes closed against the daylight.
Drawing a deep, steadying breath, Cas stands and approaches the bathroom door.  He knocks softly.  “Dean?  Are you okay?”
“There’s no good seafood in Kansas,” retorts Eileen.  “I’m enjoying it while I can.”  She leans forward and props her elbows on the table.  “So it’s vampires?”
Hunters’ funerals are rapid affairs.  Embalming is not part of the process, and it's wise to leave as little time as possible for the person’s soul to attach itself to something earthside.  The faster the funeral, the less painful.  It needs to be quick.  It needs to be quick.
’s speed picks up again.  Castiel is grateful for the daylight, having spent the remainder of the night after the attack tossing and turning in his hammock, unable to sleep without nightmares of black eyes and huge fangs.
His brain is still shouting at him that Sam and Eileen are in the other room, but Dean seems to be the only person hung up on anything, so he tries his best to shove the fear to the back of his head.
for this chapter, if you want it.
They end up driving for a little longer than Dean planned.  Nowhere seems like the right place for the conversation they’re about to have, and Dean wonders how much of that is just him stalling.  He doesn’t know
Sam is leaning through the passenger window, staring at Cas with what can only be described as extreme concern.  “Cas,” he says, taking in the sight of Cas’s blanket and pillow and the marks of the leather upholstery creased into his cheek.  “What… are you doing?”
Eileen snorts and excuses herself to the ladies’ room.
with their hunts on occasion, and a few other crews who do the same thing.”
It would make sense, he thinks abruptly, the idea shocking into his brain like a clap of thunder.  Cas is a hunter, and they always said that any partner would have to understand the hunter’s life.  Cas is his best friend, and he knows Dean better than anyone else apart from Sam.  They’re already close; would one step further really be that big of a change?
Castiel follows Dean’s gaze upward, to the glittering black.  Cassiopeia and Perseus arch across the sky, and to the east a meteor falls, fizzing out just as quickly as it appeared.  “Yes, it is,” he agrees.
“Is this your first time here?” Dean asks.
“I can’t – I can’t heal you, I can’t help you sleep, I— I’m barely useful on hunts—”  The words spill from Cas’s mouth and over the edge of the bed, clattering and scattering on the floor like marbles.
Castiel hefts Feliciana up from where she’s beginning to slip, readjusting his hold on her legs.  “You don’t have to tell me,” he amends, “but if you want to, you can.”
“I’m sure the little boy will be fine,” Castiel ventures after another solid twenty minutes.
Castiel’s jaw clacks shut, a surge of anger rearing up somewhere in his chest as he’s slapped with yet another thing Dean is refusing to tell him.  But Frank is already far ahead and Dean’s shoulders are quickly disappearing into the vegetation, so Castiel stows his arguments and hurries to catch up.
Sam is the one to light the pyre, and they all step back and watch the flames surge toward the sky, smoke pouring upward and dissipating into the blue.  Cas looks down when someone grabs his hand and sees that it’s Claire.  She squeezes his hand once with both of hers and leans her head on his shoulder, and he
logical, and he knows that.  He wanted to give up his grace.  And the Empty tore it from him and destroyed it without concern, but that shouldn’t matter.  It shouldn’t, because Cas would have chosen to give it up anyways if it meant being here, on Earth, with Dean.  Really, the Empty did him a favor.
“Preble Street?”
At least, that’s what Tallie Bilodeau tells herself every morning while trying to psych herself up to put on her damn running shoes.  But she’s still trying to shed the last couple of pounds from her third kid, and her wife is on a new healthy-living kick so Tallie’s inevitably been roped into it.  So every morning, when her alarm goes off an hour before dawn (which at this time of year isn’t even that early), she begrudgingly yanks on her sneakers and her insulated jogging clothes and drives to South Portland in the dark.
Another nod.  Sam agrees with her but can’t help turning slowly in place for a minute, grasping at the details of Cas’s living space as he left it.
Somehow, the fact that Cas isn’t speaking – isn’t even
.  He pulls his phone from the charger on the bedside table and does a quick Google search.
Somewhere in the haze of all of this is the knowledge that he couldn’t have won against the Empty or Billie, let alone both of them, but all Dean can think is that it’s his fault for not acting quickly enough.  Or decisively enough.  Or violently enough.  He’s lost Cas so many times before; how could he have let it happen again?
He looks ridiculous, really, in Sam’s clothes.
that’s supposed to make it work.  Jack closes his eyes, looking for a moment as though he’s praying, and then he lights the bowl himself.
Gagnon gives Dean an utterly unimpressed sneer.  “Do you have any idea how big Casco Bay is?”
Feliciana’s home is a small, cramped apartment above a butcher shop, the window illuminated by candlelight.  Outside the shop, she shouts, “
She stops short, then clears her throat.  “Dean’s brother,” she answers, her voice abruptly tight.  “He’s not with the crew anymore.  I thought Dean would have mentioned him.”
“Cas!” Claire shrieks.
“What’s to stop me from sending myself to Heaven?” Cas spits.  He has no idea if it’s a threat, a promise, a wish, a plea…  It would be easy, too.  The bunker is home to any number of weapons; Cas is never more than an arm’s length away from something that can kill him.
“Well, I don’t see it.”
Dean laughs, but it’s empty, hollowed out by fear.  The final peal of the bell is still echoing, hanging over the water like the scream of someone just murdered.
” Feliciana cries before she can be carried inside.
Dean furiously wipes his face with a napkin, only partially succeeding in turning his skin back to its normal color.  “I would hit you back right now if it wasn’t a criminal waste of pie,” he seethes.  “But believe me, payback is coming.”
“Careful,” Frank warns, blocking her with a bulky arm.  “They’ve not been tested yet.”
“What the hell are you
Rather than firing back at Dean’s dig at his girlfriend, Sam deftly switches tracks.  “What were you doing in Cas’s room?”
not going to see anyone,” Dean says as he spits an apple seed onto the ground and tosses the core.  “She’s an old friend of the family.  I swing by every time we stop in Tortuga.”
Nearly two months after they beat Chuck, Cas wakes tangled in Dean’s limbs.  Dean is snoring, his arm draped over Cas’s middle.  Cas waits for a while, watching Dean sleep and relishing in the warmth of the too-small bed.  He idly traces shapes on Dean’s bare shoulder with his index finger, ghosting over freckles and scars from old fights.  Finally, the clock turns over to eight-thirty and Cas sighs, not quite ready to leave this moment.  He wakes Dean, gently running his hand over Dean’s forearm until he stirs.
“No, a rehab clinic isn’t going to talk with a reporter,” Sam counters, gesturing to the Boston Globe ID poking out of Cas’s jacket pocket.  Then, to Dean, “If you didn’t sleep at all on the way here, then that’s on you.”
Alastair is above him.  He’s
In what seems to be a growing trend in this conversation, Castiel has no idea what Frank means.
The heavy bunker door slams shut behind him and the cool night air fills his lungs.  He pauses halfway up the steps to the road, his hand gripping the railing tightly.  The stars glitter indifferently overhead, the half-bare trees creak in the breeze, and the world actually
Suddenly Sam is itching to get behind the wheel, to drive off and discover everything this place has to offer, to collect things to show his wife when she joins him.
“I know.”  A small, pained smile crosses Jack’s face.  “You’re human.”
A rustling behind him makes him turn around to see Cas standing in the doorway.  He’s wearing only a too-big t-shirt and sweatpants, rumpled from sleep.  Dean has to work to suppress a snort but manages to instead offer Cas some coffee.
Instead, he’s just happy.
Sam shifts uncomfortably from foot to foot.  “Um… I think I’m going to let you two… talk,” he stammers, then retreats and follows Eileen.
The dense tree cover breaks into a wide grassy slope awash with sunlight.  Wildflowers bend and bob in the breeze, the wind rippling silver over the hill as Dean guides the Impala along the road
His mother had told him stories, fair maidens as unearthly as they were beautiful, and Castiel had longed to see one since before he could remember.  In the orphanage years later, he’d stared out the windows watching the ships on the Thames, yearning to sail away with them until he’d finally run and found work on the
“Beer,” Dean says.  “Please.”
Castiel peers at her in bewilderment, still not quite certain whether she’s playing a joke.  “So…?”
nothing.  He knows it is.
Suddenly Dean is pulled away from the door as Cas spins him, gripping him by the hips, and pitches him backward onto the bed.  Dean’s back hits the mattress and then Cas is on top of him, his mouth tracing down Dean’s sternum.
and Cas can barely look at him.
Eileen finds him ten minutes later when he still hasn’t joined them in the back yard, and she freezes the moment she sees the look on his face.  “Who?” she asks.
“It’s okay, Sam,” Dean says, clamping a hand on Sam’s shoulder.  “You can go.  You
“Wait,” the captain says firmly, raising his hand.  “Hold steady…”
, is the only ridiculous thing in Dean’s head.
barely twenty-six
Jack moves to defend Cas, but in less than an instant the Empty swings its arm up and slices into Cas’s neck.  Blood sprays, and Cas doesn’t even have time to gasp.
Dean’s shoulders finally fall at that, and he glances up to the dense canopy like he’s begging for assistance from on high.  He swallows, skin pallid in what little sunlight has made it through the trees above.  “Douens, they—”  He starts, sniffs, and starts again.  “They mimic the voice of the victim’s mother.”
He nods.  “Yes, that’s me.”
leaps from the back seat of the van as soon as Sam slides the door open, running up the porch steps and bouncing impatiently from foot to foot when he realizes the front door is locked.
“I think we can show ourselves out,” mutters Sam, already heading for the door.  Robin doesn’t seem to notice them leaving.
track with no exit in sight.  It’s not like Sam cares, not really, but… Dean does.  Even if it’s already out there, he still wants to keep it for himself a while longer.  Even if other people are comfortable seeing it, he’s not sure he’s comfortable showing them.
Lilah grins from behind the bar.  “Local brew.  You gonna want another one?”
.  But instead, Dean squeezes Cas’s hand before he lets go and says, “Yeah, Cas, I’m fine.”
The question weighs heavy on Sam’s shoulders as he cleans the kitchen, all too eager to occupy his hands.
Sam is quiet, hushed to silence by the splendor just outside Dean’s front door.
Dean’s legs bracket Cas’s hips and he gasps when Cas grinds downward, sending a jolt of electricity tearing through Dean’s core.  His hand flutters up Cas’s flank for a moment and finds a place on Cas’s neck, fingers digging into his nape and trying to pull him, somehow, closer.
“We never had them digitized because we never had the time between apocalypses to actually digitize them,” Sam replies smoothly as he scans
Dean pauses, then laughs tightly, like he’s trying to brush away something that’s clinging to his shoulder.  He deftly changes the subject.  “Nice night, isn’t it?”
“Fight monsters,” Castiel clarifies as he moves on to the next gasket.  “As a mission, I mean.  Day in, day out.”
“I’m saying that I want to think it over.”  Dean can’t make any promises right now.  He
bleeding.  There’s a huge gash in his throat and a red puddle already forming underneath him.  His coat and shirt are stained red nearly down to his waist.  He gasps for air once, twice, and then his eyes roll back in his head and his body goes limp.
By the time Cas is up to three fingers, Dean is rutting helplessly against the mattress, desperate for any kind of friction, and Cas is hitting his prostate on every other thrust.  He twists his hand slightly and Dean releases a string of swears into the pillows.
More vomit splashes into the toilet.  A beat of silence, then a flush.  The tap runs.
“You all right?” Dean asks, studying Castiel with his forehead knitted in concern.
Sam frowns in confusion.  “Wouldn’t this guy have known that if he works in the city?”
Cas’s heart lurches to a stop, his hands going numb.
The captain’s piercing gaze swivels around to Castiel, like a lighthouse beam in the night.  “You’d do well to speak softly, boy.”
Sam clears his throat, his eyes darting toward the door.  Dean nods; it’s time they wrap this conversation up.
Sam gives him a look, like he knows what Dean was just doing.  Rather than lecture Dean about his drinking, Sam merely hands the spell book to Jack.
“Hello, Sam.”
Cas smiles at the sky.  “No.  No, I couldn’t.”
“Dean, why wouldn’t you tell me that you wanted out?” Sam asks.
They spot Eileen’s Plymouth Valiant parked at the head of one of the piers and stop.  Dean gets out of the car, allowing Sam to switch into the driver’s seat, then gives him a quick “Call if you need anything” before he drives off.
for me,” he says.  “Second, I don’t need to see them.  I have everything I need here.”
Sam raises his eyebrows, waiting.
He half hopes that Cas decides to wear whatever he’s chosen out of the store, but when they meet back up Cas has changed back into Sam’s poorly fitted hand-me-downs.  At the very least, Dean thinks, Cas is far from the worst-dressed person to ever wander into a Wal-Mart.
Part of Cas – a big part – considers killing himself quickly.  He’s human now, so it should be easy.  Humans are breakable and susceptible to any number of deaths.  His soul will go to Heaven where he’ll relive his best memories, and he knows he’ll be with Dean.
Sam glances between Cas and Dean for a half-second, then repeats the details of the potential case.
“If I didn’t know better, I’d say it was a vampire,” Gagnon says, and Dean and Sam freeze.
“You could have borrowed more of mine.”
“Nothing from you,” Dean replies smoothly.  “I’m here to see Missouri.”
Cas doesn’t listen and instead hoists himself up to sit back against the headboard.  The clock on the bedside table glows a menacing
Cas stumbles over the dead and dismembered vampires, barely noticing them.  He’s focused entirely on Dean’s face.  His eyes are closed, his mouth slightly open.  Cas cups Dean’s cheek and there’s no response.  His skin isn’t cold yet, but it’s not as warm as it should be.  There’s no color, no sign of pain, no small but sure pulsing of the vein in Dean’s temple.
(See the end of the chapter for
“It’s not about you,” Cas says softly, running his fingers along Dean’s forearm.  “Not really.”
But with nobody left to drive her, leaving her untouched seems almost cruel.  Cas is fairly certain he’s imagining it, but he thinks she perks up when he comes in, sitting straighter on her wheels.
Dean is waiting on the porch, hand on the railing.  A pair of Adirondack chairs rest to his left.
.  Castiel can barely keep track of him far ahead, waistcoat flapping as he weaves through the crowds and turns down one street, then another, and another.  Castiel’s boots splash through the mud and he narrowly evades horses, carts, people, and leaps out of the way of a chamberpot emptying from the upper level of an inn.
The Empty screeches, the sound piercing through them like the noise of a sun exploding.  Its form shifts again, brown hair melting into yellow until Claire’s face appears.  Her eyes are sparkling like distant stars, cold and unfeeling and ready to burn him to a crisp.
you know about the world,” he snaps.  “Let your guard down, and that’s when something new will come around and bite your head off.”
Dean doesn’t know what Cas was intending to say –
Shower-damp and wrapped again in the robe, Dean makes his way to the kitchen after and sets the coffee pot brewing, as he promised.
.  He’s still stuck on that track, somehow, and he wants to smack himself upside the head for thinking he'd be able to change that overnight.  “Force of habit,” he manages to grunt out as an answer.
Dean stares at the portal, and it takes everything in him to not take a running leap and follow after Jack.  But he knows that there’s no way in this or any other dimension that the Empty would ever let him back out.
.  Hoping a wrench will fly off the tool shelf by the stairs, or that Dorothy Baum’s motorcycle will tip over, or that the Impala’s engine will spontaneously start.
She shifts uncomfortably from foot to foot, her prior coolheadedness all but gone.  “I-I, uh.  No.  I don’t know.  I really don’t know him well enough to say.”
Before Castiel can say another word, a shout reaches them from several stalls back.
But ambiguity is not his friend, and Dean either wants this or he doesn’t.  And he knows he does.  There’s no use twisting himself into tighter and tighter knots over things that haven’t even happened yet.  All he can do is let them happen.
“She’s a hunter’s car.  She needs to be with a hunter.”
Cas and Sam exchange a look, and quickly head for the Impala to retrieve their guns.  If someone was about to discover them burning a body in a field, it wouldn’t end well.  Their fears are quashed, however, when they recognize the vehicles coming down the dirt road.  Three trucks and a car all drive into the meadow and park next to the Impala and the Valiant.
Lilah, who had presumably come over to take Sam’s order, is now standing there staring down at the police file.  Sam quickly moves to close it.
They have, what, another forty years?  If they’re lucky?  The eons of Castiel’s life that stretch behind him are fragmenting in his head, memories falling out of his human-capacity brain like files deleting from a hard drive.  The forty-if-they’re-lucky years ahead of him seem like a drop in the ocean, a blink of an eye, and suddenly death is right around the bend, lurking in the corner of his bedroom.  He grips the sides of the sink, staring at his reflection in the mirror and repeating under his breath,
“You don’t have to sound so surprised,” Dean retorts, untying the robe.  His hands shake only slightly, and he’s proud of himself for that.
to keep you in business.”
Cas’s eyes drop to Dean’s mouth, and back up again.  Dean really wasn’t kidding about the honeymoon phase — the thrill hasn’t even begun to fade, and he’s not sure it ever will.  He thinks he’d be fine with the honeymoon phase lasting for the next decade or so; maybe longer.  Heat pools low in his belly as Cas’s hand loops around the nape of his neck and pulls him into a kiss.
And Dean is right.  John was never the father either of them wanted or needed; he was just the one they had, and they’d had him enough in life.  They have nothing more to ask of him.  Nothing more to prove.
A noise to his right draws his attention, and he grabs Dean’s arm.  In the corner lies the only body still somewhat intact — half-eaten and missing any distinguishing features — and next to it, bound in vines like flies in a web are two small children.
The weight of God’s expectations, of John’s, of the world’s
do you remember the spot where we had Dean’s funeral?” Sam manages to ask.
Dean ushers them out to the front porch then, to sit and drink and enjoy the view.  Dean and Sam sit on the Adirondack chairs, while Cas sinks onto the top step and leans his back against the rail post.  From inside, Robert Plant sings on the stereo.
“Colorado.  He was on a hunt with Claire and Donna.”  Sam speaks only in sign.  His throat is closing up.
He’s suddenly
His fingers ghost over her shell.  “I’m sorry,” he whispers to her.
“I think so,” Dean replies.  “I mean, I’m pretty sure.  I’ve had enough of ‘em myself.”
Cas is angry.  He’s furious.  After the first few weeks of numb, barely-functioning denial, Cas settled comfortably into the second stage of grief and got stuck.  He’s not tried to bargain.  He’s too angry to be depressed.  And he sure as hell isn’t accepting anything.
Castiel flinches back.  He doesn’t know what test they’re about to put him to, but he didn’t just survive drowning only to be stabbed twenty minutes later.  He suddenly wonders if he’d be better off jumping overboard and taking his chances with the sharks.
“Good night.”
As the sun finally crawls above the solid line of Cushing Island, Tallie turns to leave, coffee calling her name.  She stops when something catches her eye, at the edge of the breakwater where it dips into the ocean.
“Where’s the den?”
“Sorry, there’s not enough room for two,” she shrugs.  “We work with what we have, so one of you’ll have to stand.”
He’s not hungry.  He turns down breakfast and sips on his coffee and ignores the weird look Sam’s giving him.  When Dean comes in a few minutes later, Cas can’t seem to find the energy to listen in while Sam informs them of the newest possible case he’s found.  He keeps his nose in his mug, breathing in the steam and trying to shake this feeling of unfounded annoyance.
Dean swallows the old instinct to argue against any implication of his own worth.  If anything in his life was going to make him feel worthy, surely this should be it.  “Did you always know this was going to happen?” he asks instead.
Castiel casts one look over his shoulder, at the door to the captain’s cabin, and hears something heavy slam inside.  He watches Dean stalk all the way to the prow, climbing up to the foredeck and disappearing behind the railing.
Castiel sits back, placing his now-empty dish at his feet.  “Find a ship to take me to Havana, I suppose,” he says.  “Then find work.”
There’s a hiss from behind them, and Castiel whirls on his heel to see a creature crawling over the edge of the starboard bow.  He flinches back with a gasp, knocking into Dean.  There’s nowhere to run.
And then it’s over as quickly as it began.  Jack reaches into the void and vanishes, the black hole collapsing after him.  The library goes silent, leaving Sam and Dean’s ears ringing.  The only thing left is a silken thread of light hovering over the brick wall where the hole had been, a rift between the Earth and the Empty beyond.
” the girl cries when Marie Helene comes in, and wraps her arms around her mother’s waist.
Sam does not sit down.  He stands in the middle of the entryway and demands that Donna spit it out.
The odor only grows thicker inside, trapped by humidity and a lack of ventilation.  Castiel slides forward with his belly scraping the ground and the branches of the den walls scratching down his back, occasionally poking him in the sides.
“Oh.  Uh.”  Castiel gives Feliciana an awkward pat on the back, unsure of what else to do.
“Sure.”
Dean nestles up to the place where Cas’s wings used to be, covering up the unseen scars with his own body.  It’s all he can do, really.  This pain, this loss… it’s right, and it’s what should have happened.  But that doesn’t make it hurt any less.
“Well, no,” Patience explains, dropping the empty basket into the corner and grabbing a second knife from the counter.  She sits at the head of the table and begins shucking the skins from the sweet potatoes.  “My grandmother can read thoughts.  She senses things from certain objects, reads energies, tunes in to people’s souls.  I can’t; I see the future instead.”
Dean vigorously shakes his head.  “
, from his skin down to the very atoms that make him.  He suddenly realizes that he’s dying – really, truly
“Well, he’s not,” Frank snaps, jabbing the gun in Castiel’s direction.
At that moment, a woman’s voice calls out from the dark.
In the small moments where Cas and Dean are alone, they discover each other gradually, bit by bit.  Cas decides that this is the best time in his eons-long life.
worse.
Dean reaches for the bags containing the bedsheets to take them to the linen closet, but it’s Cas’s turn to catch him off guard.  Without warning, Cas loops a hand around the back of Dean’s neck and kisses him again, longer and deeper and enough to make Dean’s toes curl in his boots.  An alarm bell goes off somewhere in him — that this isn’t private enough, that Sam could walk in at any second, that one kiss in public per day is already almost more than he can handle — but the alarm quiets as Cas’s fingers wind into the hair at the nape of Dean’s neck.
In the morning, Cas sits in the passenger seat of Claire’s 1993 Fox Body Mustang as she drives away from the bunker.  He’s pulled everything he needs for a vamp hunt from the Impala’s trunk and stashed it in the Mustang’s – there’s no reason for three hunters to use three vehicles and he knows that either Claire or Donna will be more than happy to give him a ride back to Lebanon afterwards.  The Mustang is small and tough, a vicious terrier, and Claire laughs at him when he has to move the seat all the way back for adequate leg room.
“Maryann’s the supervisor today, but she’s out on lunch,” Robin replies.  “It’s just me here at the moment.”
” he asks again.
fingers around the tip of Cas’s thumb.  “Oh…” Cas sighs.  “He’s beautiful.”
“Deal.”  Claire is visibly happy that he’s agreed, and Cas loves that she thought to ask for his help.
“Come on,” Dean beckons him back to his feet and leads the way up the steps.  Returning to the deck, Castiel has to squint as his eyes readjust to the sunlight.  Dean goes to the ship’s edge and drops the rind of his orange overboard, then leans on his elbows.  “It’ll take us a few days to reach Tortuga.  But once we’re there I can help you find another ship to run with.”
Sam stares at him.  “What?”
Castiel pushes down the collar of Dean’s shirt, swiping at a couple drops of blood that trickled almost to his shoulder blade before drying, and stops short.  Close to where his fingertips are pressing the cloth to Dean’s skin, there’s scarring.
Back on his feet, Cas leaps at her again, desperately trying to regain his hold on the machete while dodging her claws.  He finally grasps the hilt solidly and yanks as hard as he can – it comes free with a disgusting squelch as her claws rake through his shoulder, tearing the fabric of his shirt and his flesh beneath it.
The door slams shut.  Then, the only sound is Dean vomiting noisily into the toilet.
bite wound, by the way?”
in sleep when a loud noise drags him back into consciousness.  He comes around groggily, his brain fighting to keep his eyes closed, and grumbles as he scrapes a palm over his face.  He squints blearily at the alarm clock on the bedside table and barely makes out that it’s 2:17 in the morning.  To his right, Eileen is snoring loudly, her arm thrown over her forehead.
There's only a moment of stillness before he swipes up at Sam with large claws, and with superhuman strength throws Sam off.  Sam hits the ground bodily and scrambles to right himself, while Dean reaches to retrieve his machete.  The stranger is back on his feet before either of them can do anything about it, and Cas and Eileen chase after him at full speed.
Dean lets out a long breath, trying to stave off the ache in his chest, and looks back up at the sky.  “I guess not.”
When Sam steps back from Dean’s solid embrace, he looks down at his hands.  His skin is young again
Dean is
for me, then you’re blind.  I’m sorry, but you’re fucking blind.”
The reality of Cas’s death is starting to sink in, and Dean finds himself at the table in the library with no memory of walking there.  Sam must have dragged him there, out of the dungeon where Cas disappeared – died – was

“Eileen wanted to visit a

Jean-Luc’s mother’s name is Marie Helene.  She’s young
“I doubt any ship in Tortuga will have honest work,” Castiel says.  In his years aboard the
Eileen sighs, swallows, and begins to pull perishables out of the fridge.
Cas waits for exactly two minutes before he pushes Dean’s arm off him and stands up, making Dean groan indignantly into the pillow.  “Come on,” Cas urges, lightly slapping Dean’s thigh.
While Frank works, Dean sits on the ground with the children, neither of whom seem at all willing to leave his side.  So far, he’s not succeeded in convincing the girl to say anything, but Jean-Luc is chattering at him in French and doesn’t seem to realize that Dean doesn’t speak his language.
Cas has no idea what that means, but it sends a chill through his body.  Terror claws at the back of his skull, his breath quickening.  “Where… where is he?” he asks, his voice shaking.
Dean does as he’s told, looking a bit like a scolded puppy.
Dean barely has time to sit down and say hello before the bartender approaches them and drops a couple of menus onto the tabletop.  “Welcome to the King’s Head,” she says, clapping Dean on the shoulder.  She has a tattoo of a toucan on the inside of her forearm.  “My name is Lilah.  What can I get started for you?”
He’s always been a sky rat, comfortably at home up in the rigging and sails, and it takes him barely any time at all to learn his way around the
“He just finished kindergarten last week,” Cas says fondly, cracking open a fortune cookie.
Castiel sees none of that now.  Somehow this small, solitary creature has rattled Dean to his core.  His face is pale and his knife still clutched tight and quivering at his side like he expects the douen to leap again from the trees.  His eyes are blank, unseeing, and he jolts at Castiel’s touch.
, after all.  Dean swallows audibly, self-conscious and shy for the first time in years.
Dean scrambles to his feet, giving Cas a wide berth, and makes for the bathroom.
Cas lets out a huff of relief, feeling dizzy.  “Thanks,” he says.  “Are you both okay?”
Everything is too long, too wide, and seems to swallow Cas whole.  Even Jimmy’s clothes had been too big on him, oddly, the suit and coat wearing Cas more than the other way round, but that was nothing compared to Sam’s things.  He has to roll up the sleeves on all the shirts in order to use his hands, and the pants bunch up around the ankles.  He looks like he’s wearing a plaid flannel tent.
Castiel yanks the rope on the alarm bell hanging at the railing of the foredeck, and he sees Rufus’ silhouette immediately straighten at the helm.  The bell clangs again and again, resounding over the ship.  Dean is already running at full sprint for the cargo hold, shouting as he thunders down the steps below.
Sam glances down to where Cas is lounging on the steps; he winks back at Dean.
Despite the cacophony of the harbor and its surrounding town, the crowds and the filth and the buildings crammed up against one another, the vast majority of Tortuga is heavily blanketed by forest.  Immediately beyond the edge of town are small crop fields bearing fruits and vegetables, and they quickly give way to trees and brush.  The woods are dense enough that even during midday it’s still tenebrous and murky, the canopy filtering the unrelenting sunlight into little droplets that scatter and vanish in the undergrowth.  Plenty of places for any number of creatures to hide with their prey.
Well.  Not exactly.  Jack is gone too.
Dean snorts, smiling at the tabletop.  “Yeah, that’s true.  Guy’s pretty short on marketable skills.”  He taps his fingers a few times in thought.  “All right, when we get back to the bunker, you can help.  Thanks.”
just a fact, always there, some days a shadow in the corner of his eyes, some days sitting so heavy on his chest that it’s hard to breathe.  But he’s used to it.
A hand clamps down on his shoulder, and Dean’s voice murmurs low in his ear, “Hey, calm down.”
On the main deck is sheer chaos.  Men shouting, screaming, fighting.  Blood on the planks.  A dozen mermaids, maybe more, impossible to tell in the pandemonium.
Dean’s body stitches itself back together as he follows Alastair’s grip up, up, up to standing.  Alastair’s hands are tight on his shoulders as he turns Dean around to face the rack, where there’s already a soul waiting for him.
Frank grumbles but lowers his weapon at last, his suspicious glare unwavering.  A tiny muscle under his right eye spasms as Dean sidles through the door past him.
“Good.  Here.”  Dean holds out a pastry, some kind of meat pie.
In the morning, Cas is startled awake by a sharp rap on the Impala’s roof.  He squints blearily at the offender, his knees creaking from being bent for hours.
“Yeah, ‘cause vamps so often know their victims personally,” Dean says dryly.  But for a victim without a crime scene, it’s the only place to start.
He’s alone, but he’s not cold or frightened.  And he doesn’t have to wait long.
“What’s going on, Cas?”
“Surprise me,” he finally says.
“HEY!” Sam shouts, approaching from the opposite direction with Eileen and forcing the vetala’s attention away from Dean.  Instantly, she lunges for Sam.
“You’re pirates,” he says, his grip on the bulward tightening.
, what is he going to tell Dean?
Ishim seizes Castiel’s shoulders and shoves him hard.  “Go!  Go!”
“Man, I was having a good dream,” Dean grumbles, only half coherent as he shifts closer.
”  There’s an aproned giant of a man standing outside his stall, a sausage-sized finger jabbing in their direction while his face rapidly turns purple.
In the mornings, Cas still makes breakfast for himself, Sam, and Eileen, and then walks the dog.  With Miracle in tow, he meanders through the wooded roads surrounding the bunker, witnessing the changing of the seasons as months tick by.  The first colorless winter is the hardest.
The corners of Castiel’s mouth tug upwards for a mere fraction of a second, a microexpression so small that Dean’s not even sure he saw it.
At last, Dean trudges back into the light, blood streaked up his arms and spattered across his chest.  Feliciana is cradled in his arms, tear-streaked and trembling.
The full realization of everything that Castiel has lost hits Dean like a freight train, his coffee going cold in his hand despite the steam coming off the top.  Everything that Cas has given up, has sacrificed, has fought for… and how short his life will be.  He had expected to live for millenia – no, for
“I-I couldn’t – I couldn’t g-get him down,” is the only thing Sam is able to articulate.
“You two been having fun?” Dean asks, chuckling at Cas’s worn-out expression.
“You miss them?” Eileen asks as she pulls a detached claw out of her hair.
“Listen to me carefully.”
” she says.  Her words tremble through the phone.
Back inside, as Dean pulls a pair of longnecks from the fridge and twists the caps off, Sam leans against the counter.  “So this is your Heaven, huh?”
It’s new and, knowing the both of them, it’s a little scary, so Sam keeps any remarks to himself.  After everything they’ve been through, Sam supposes Cas and Dean are more than entitled to their privacy, if that’s something they want.
It’s another long minute before Dean says a word, and just as Castiel thinks he’s not going to answer, he speaks.
Eileen gives him a withering look.  “Obviously,” she signs.
Castiel and Ishim throw their shoulders against the dinghy, pushing it toward the water, but it’s not necessary.  The land flexes and drops abruptly, water rushing up the rocks.  The wave seizes the dinghy and lifts it easily, and Castiel and Ishim are barely able to climb in before they’re dragged to the same fate as Inias.  The ocean surges up, flooding past the beach, vegetation and trees disappearing into the water.
A moment later, there’s a crinkly
He doesn’t know where they’re going to put her, but there’s no other possible answer.  “Yes,” he replies, already making plans in his head to clean out the garage.  “Of course.”
“What exactly are we supposed to be looking for?” Frank asks as he hacks through a particularly tangled web of vines.
Claire runs toward him, crying his name and reaching for him.  His knees buckle before she can get to him, and he tips backwards.  The last thing he sees is her face, and then he tumbles over the edge of the roof and falls into empty space.  The last thing he hears is her screaming.
because of that, anyways.  Dean doesn’t have a long history of connecting with anybody in this way, and hell, he’d even had his fair share of vulnerability issues with Lisa.
The bemused smile slides from Castiel’s face.  “Wait.  Truly?  Psychics?”
Claire appears from behind, slamming a fistful of pennies into the alpha’s mouth.  The hit makes the alpha’s hand squeeze reflexively, a single gunshot echoing out over the industrial sprawl ten stories below them.  Cas flinches at the noise, and in the same instant Donna removes the alpha’s head from her shoulders.  The Nachzehrer’s body falls unceremoniously, blood splattering out from her gaping neck and turning the concrete crimson.
“Only on days we’re not rescuing near-dead sailors,” replies the captain smoothly.  He cracks the first smile since his arrival.  It’s wide and mirthless and full of teeth.
—” Donna starts, and her voice hitches slightly.  “
“Hey, do
When Jack starts to pull Cas along with him, Cas yanks his hand away.  “Jack, you have to leave.  Before the Empty finds you.  I made a deal, and I accept the consequences.  Go!”
Castiel winces, rolling his shoulder as he tests the limits of its movement.  “I think so.”
Dean shakes his head, grinning.  “Heaven ain’t like that anymore.”
he exhales and tries to see his breath.
“Eileen says hi too.  What’s up?”
White light spills into the Impala’s cabin as the headlights draw closer, then flash once, twice, three times in a frantic warning.  More honking.
Dean smiles, bright even in the midnight gloom.  “Yeah.  I’d take you on my side in a fight any day.  How many’d you get?”
It feels odd to be back in the garage, though Cas can’t quite put his finger on why.  Everything feels suddenly more solid than it did when he’d left.
” he hisses, terror coursing through his veins.
It’s not that he thinks he has any real reason to be afraid of Cas, or anything involving Cas.  But Dean’s just… not used to this.  To anything beyond superficiality.  And it’s not because Cas is a man — not
He disappears into the corridor and Dean just stands there by the map table for a minute, hair prickling where Cas tugged on it, until he manages to give himself a shake and re-orient the room around him.
“Come on,” Ishim says to Castiel, taking a few empty water skins from the boat.  “Let’s try to find a spring or something.”
Frank nods.  “Can’t tell what it is exactly, though.  I ain’t ever sensed that before.  Smells like rotten poultry.”
Immortality laps at the edges of his mind, inescapable and inaccessible.
Cas doesn’t — won’t — apologize for being worried, but he obliges and backs off.  “Come back to bed when you’re ready.”
Maybe Dean’s not been gone long enough to know how to pierce through the Veil.  They saw the same thing happen with Bobby years ago; it’s not unheard of.  Maybe Dean is right there, just out of reach, just out of sight.  Maybe he’s screaming to be heard.
“That’s impossible.”
Cas sits bolt upright in an instant, his mind already spinning with possible scenarios — Dean in the bathroom puking up his guts again, Dean taken off in the Impala without so much as a word, Dean
Cas chuckles, glancing up at Eileen through the diner window.  She’s also on her phone, checking in quickly with Sam through a video call.
Castiel is quiet for a while as he considers this, and he comes to the conclusion that Garth is probably right.  Making sure a person doesn’t turn into a vengeful spirit is likely to be equal parts strategy and kindness
“It was gross,” Dean answers.  “Did you and Cas talk with the woman who found the body?”
By the time they’re finished, they’ve each interviewed at least a dozen people and the frost has melted from the sidewalks, but Eileen’s fingers are still freezing.  She blows into her hands to warm them as she and the boys reconvene on the street corner a block up the hill.
“Are you insane?” Frank snaps, eyes beady in the firelight.  “That girl’s as good as dead.”
of time with Sam lately, and the same is true of him and Dean.  The brothers have had barely any space to hang out just the two of them.  And Cas knows it’s the right call, since Dean is already excited at the prospect of working a case with just Sam for the first time in a long while.
So Cas stays.  He lives.
At that moment, Cas decides that what they need is a place with light, and people, and
Castiel’s chest heaves, and he braces one hand on his knee.  His other hand still holds the pie.  “You… bastard,” he huffs, sweat dripping from his nose.
Dean slides in behind him, letting Cas settle before cinching his arm around Cas’s middle.  Finally Cas can feel his body relaxing, muscles uncoiling, tension seeping into the mattress and disappearing.  He stares at the crack of light underneath Dean’s bedroom door, pulls the blanket up over his shoulder, and focuses on Dean’s solid grip.
They have the ingredients in a burn-proof bowl this time, on the end of the library table, and this time Jack won’t have to eat them.  Which is kind of a pity, because this particular concoction seems much more edible.  Yarrow root, dried blackberry leaves, pure unprocessed honey, sprigs of greenbriar and sage and rosemary, and just a few grams of ground peyote.
Something gives, and Dean lurches forward, falling onto Castiel as he finally manages to pull Dean free.  One douen still clings to Dean’s leg, teeth digging into the meat of his calf through his breeches as it's dragged behind him.  Castiel quickly untangles himself from Dean and stabs the douen through the top of its skull.  Instantly, its limbs go limp, mouth hanging open, like a puppet that’s just had its strings cut.
He glares at Eileen, who’s grinning at him across the table.  “I’m
dried salt beef, rice, and beans.  It’s hearty food, and Castiel is starving, so he doesn’t make chitchat with the others as he eats, content to just listen to their conversations.
“Well, like the coroner said, a lot of arrests but nothing violent,” Sam says, skimming down the front page of Fred Sargent’s arrest record.  “He was a veteran, homeless, no family.  Seems like a guy who got dealt a bad hand.  Oh, and he apparently was at the Kettle Cove Rehab Clinic a couple times a month at least.”
After another few seconds of silence, with no sign they’re about to become prey to any kind of vicious monster, Castiel begins to wonder if they’d hallucinated the creature in the water.  “Do you think it was just the one?” he asks.
The woman is still crying, sagging against the wall like the very air’s gone out of her.  Missouri gestures for her to wait a moment.
What convinces him that he is, in fact, awake is not Jack, but rather the black surrounding them.  Castiel can feel the Empty pressing against every molecule in his body, ancient fury washing over him and making it hard to breathe.  He can sense billions upon billions upon billions of souls in every direction, pressing up close and yet still lightyears away.  It’s all terrifyingly real.
His head presses to Alastair’s collarbone.  Alastair’s voice goes horribly gentle, pouring down Dean’s back like honey.
“Ah, come on, that was fun,” Dean says breathlessly, lightly slapping Castiel’s shoulder with the back of his hand.
Dean leans forward, shining his own flashlight where Sam is looking.  Sam reaches further into the truck, fumbling, and his fingers wrap around a handle tucked away in the corner, out of the way of the compactor.  He gives the handle a tug, and a panel falls open.  The opening is just big enough for a trash bag to be tossed inside, though it doesn’t look like it goes anywhere — it's a storage compartment.
“Whatever,” is all Dean says, and sips his coffee.
“More than enough,” Castiel agrees.  “But I’ll stay.”
Cas is quiet, letting Dean ramble.
Claire shakes her head.  “No, no, I’m good.  I actually wanted to ask a favor.”
Dean swallows, clears his throat.  Blinks and refocuses.  Castiel can see him pulling himself together, restructuring himself from the inside out, and Dean nods.  “Yeah.  Yeah, I’m good.”
He feels like a broken compass, whirling back and forth with no target in sight.
Cas coughs out a breath, the air tearing out of his lungs with sharp edges.  He barely manages a nod.  The longer Dean is stuck there, the worse it is.
leaving the hunter’s life, let alone dive headfirst into normalcy.  Except for… Sam suddenly recalls Lisa, and how Dean gave everything up for her – the weapons, the thrill of the hunt, even the

The drop of the ladder is quickly followed by the lowering of the dinghy, and then Castiel is rowing to shore with the five-man scouting party.  He and Ishim jump into knee-deep water to haul the dinghy onto land, the wood slats scraping against the rock.  Suddenly, they’re in the shadow of a densely forested hill.
“Let’s go.”
Dean draws his arm back, pats Cas on the knee, and says something about getting the popcorn ready as he heaves himself up off the couch.
They’re close enough to the Bahamas that an undiscovered land mass is far less likely than winds simply blowing them off their normal route, but the idea that they’ve gone off course for the first time in a decade makes uneasiness settle into Castiel’s spine.  He has made the journey across from England with the
This is stupid.
and he watches the empty town slide past in the dark.  He thinks he feels the Impala sigh in relief under a gentler hand on her steering wheel.  Jack avoids all the potholes and bumps on the road leading to the bunker.
Cas recalls a case that Sam and Dean worked in Oregon ages ago.  By now it’s been at least ten years, but Cas remembers the details.  Creatures that eat hearts
To move a ship forward using a favorable tide or current, thereby traveling without sufficient wind.
Later, after breakfast, Dean announces that he’s found a case in Ohio – children disappearing in pairs, their parents left dead or disfigured.  Eileen finds another in Parkersburg, West Virginia, and turns her laptop around so they can see the article reporting that three bodies had turned up with their hearts ripped out.  There’s some debate among the four of them as to which case to tackle first, until Dean decides they should split up.
“It’s an antelope, I think,” Dean replies, keeping his eyes on the task at hand as he does the same with the buntline to Castiel’s right.  “Like a deer.  Captain spent some of his time with His Majesty’s army in Africa, said they were all over the place, and faster than you could believe.  Nigh impossible to catch.”
Before Dean has the chance to refill his cup again, Cas tells him to get dressed.
Two spells, buried deep in the dusty, decaying archives of the Men of Letters tomes.  Jack has the brilliant idea of researching Dreamwalker lore, since Kaia was the one to open the portal to the Bad Place, and he finds a spell that will temporarily give him the ability to Dreamwalk like she did.  Sam finds an ancient ritual in Enochian for turning a person into an archangel Sword, a true vessel, therefore amplifying the archangel’s power.  Jack is almost vibrating with relief and excitement as he says they now have a real shot at retrieving Castiel.
Patience pauses, fixing him with a level gaze.  “I find that most people don’t really want to know their futures,” she says.  “And I can’t say that I blame them.  In any case, if I do tell them what the future holds, the mere fact that they know what’s coming is enough to knock them from that path and into a different future.  Best to keep one’s visions to oneself.”
that!” he cries, though he’s starting to laugh too.  “I’m human now; my heart can’t take this.”
In the dark once again, Dean yanks the pillow over his head with an irritated huff and he stays there until sleep finds him at last.
Cas is offering, but Dean still has to ask.
something,
Cas presses his mouth shut, staring at the crack of light beneath the door.
“So how long did you make it?” Dean asks, breaking Sam from his thoughts.
Frank’s gun swivels to point at Castiel, which Castiel does not appreciate.  “And him?” Frank demands.  “What is he?”
Shouts from the crew.  More are slithering onto the deck below
Donna, Jody, Bobby, Charlie, Patience, Claire, Kaia, Alex, Eileen, Cas, and Sam all build the pyre together.  There are tears and reassuring hugs and loving stories and broken laughter over memories relived.  And when it’s time, Cas and Sam carry Dean from the car.  When Cas falters while tying the shroud, Jody steps in to help.  Bobby splashes gasoline.  Charlie hands Sam her lighter.
with you?!”
Cas looks over at him, his hands in his lap and confusion on his face.  “Is… is that what you want to discuss?”
“Then
“Dean?” Cas ventures, his voice cracking and hushed.
“How long have you been feeling like that?”  The question jumps from Dean’s chest before he has a chance to stop it, somehow both desperate for and dreading the answer.
Dean smiles to himself, certain that what Sam really means is that he’s going to see Eileen for some much-needed alone time.  After everything they’ve been through over the years, he knows Sam sure as hell deserves some happiness.
“Cas, it’s going to take me some time to really process this, okay?” he admits, running his fingers through his hair on the back of his head.
,” the boy whispers.
As if on cue, Sam walks in and finds them in the corner booth, taking a seat between Dean and Eileen.  He sets a file on the table, the folder branded with the Portland Police Department logo.
“Ugh,” he says as he stacks the plates and tucks a few bottles under his arm.  (It does not escape his notice, however, that only four empty bottles is quite the drop from Dean’s usual level of alcohol consumption.)
A gasp of a sob bursts out of him.
They reach the bunker shortly after dawn, and Cas doesn’t know if it’s the hunt, the long and sleepless drive, or the blood loss, but he’s exhausted.  Sam and Eileen are still an hour or two behind them, having stopped more frequently to trade shifts driving, so Dean calls dibs on the shower and heads to his room to unpack.
“You have
Sam and Eileen keep Miracle, at Cas’s insistence.  Sam protests, shaking his head vigorously.  “No, Cas, you need to keep him,” he argues.
Dean sleeps the whole night through.  When he wakes in the morning, he returns to consciousness slowly, Cas’s arms heavy where they’re still entwined, his face nestled into Dean’s shoulder.  Dean doesn’t open his eyes immediately, content to lie still for a little while longer with Cas’s breath tickling his neck.
“That,” says Dean, staring at the glass in his hand like it’s made of pure gold, “is the best beer I have ever had.  Holy
Cas shakes his head, lungs trembling in an exhale.  “I can’t—” he starts, and chokes.
Dean blinks.  “Seriously?”
“I’ll meet you up there,” Dean says, and Cas nods and continues up the stairs and out of the bunker.
“It wouldn’t be fair to you,” Dean adds, hoping that’s enough to make himself clear.
Sam clears his throat, wiping condensation from his beer bottle with the pad of his thumb.  “I just wish Eileen were here,” he says, and almost feels guilty for saying it.
He barely has another second to wonder what the noise was when it happens again
“Really, man?” Dean grumbles, quickly moving his beer glass out of Sam’s line of fire.  “You can’t even take a second to sit down?  Why don’t you order a beer?”
Castiel obeys, letting Dean shift the boy to an easier position.
“My point is,” Dean continues, “she’ll show up when you’re ready.  But until then, enjoy all of this.”  He sweeps his hand out, gesturing to the vanishing horizon and the sky beyond.
Before charging blindly into the woods, Dean, Castiel, and Frank circle back again to the psychics’ house to arm themselves, once Dean has confirmed that a douen can only be killed by a silver knife.  Frank packs a small goatskin bag with food and a few other necessities and slings it over his shoulders.  Castiel takes the silver knife Patience hands him and straps it to his belt.
Cas hooks the fingers of one hand into his pocket as he takes a sip, his Adam’s apple catching Dean’s attention for a moment when he swallows.  “Good different?” he asks.
Dean is the opposite, deep in sleep with his mouth slightly open and his face squashed heavily into the pillow.  His eyes flick back and forth underneath the lids.  A muscle in his cheek spasms.  Cas studies the contour of his nose and can’t help running a finger down the curve of his jaw.  Dean doesn’t stir.  For once, he’s not snoring.
Once they cross Congress, the hill slopes downward again, and it’s only two blocks before they find the resource center.  They recognize it not by the sign at the top of the building, but by the dozens upon dozens of people gathered at the doorways and scattered across the surrounding sidewalks.  Some sit on curbs, others wait in line to receive paper-bag meals passed out by volunteers, and a few slump against chain-link fences, eyes rolling in a drug haze.  Litter is strewn everywhere, and it’s difficult to avoid stepping on needles discarded on the concrete.
Cas glances past Dean’s shoulder and nods silently in agreement.
Jack only quirks an eyebrow at him and walks around to the driver’s side.
Cas blinks, blue eyes greyed in the light of the kitchen.  “Yes.  Once a month.”
.  And Sam’s only saying it to make himself feel better.
The coroner is a chubby man in his early forties with a neck beard and an ID badge that states his name — Matt Gagnon — in bold letters.  He shrugs.  “I mean, sure, but honestly there wasn’t much to do an autopsy
After being dragged back out of the Empty, graceless and profusely bleeding, his own clothes were no longer in any condition to be used and had to be thrown out.  Even the trenchcoat was tossed when no amount of scrubbing and rinsing would get the blood out of its seams.  Dean offers to get Cas a new one, but surprisingly Cas declines the offer.  “I think I’d like to find something different,” he says instead.
bring him back.”
Cas ends the call and goes back inside.  He asks the waitress for a box so he can take his lunch to go, eager to wrap up the case.
At last, Jack sits back on his heels and draws his hands away.  The gash in Castiel’s throat is gone, but the blood still stains his clothes and the floor beneath him.  And it’s
"Damn it."  Dean winces, picking gravel out of the palm of his hand where it was scraped.
“Wait,
Dean lurches forward, sidestepping as one of the douen’s arms swings perilously close to his neck, and shouts “Grab him!” to Castiel.
He’s pulled under by a force so strong, the air is ripped from his lungs as he goes down, bubbles streaming from his mouth like his very soul is escaping him.  The strongest man on earth couldn’t swim against this current.
Ropes used to hoist sails up for stowage.  The buntlines are situated along the center of the sail, while the clewlines are only at the edges and used to hoist the corners.
Castiel stands there for a minute, unsure if he should just go back to the crew’s quarters and pretend like nothing happened.  In the end, he follows Dean.
Frank makes a sort of growl in his throat, like he hates both the question and the person asking it.  “You want me to track vampires, sirens, mermaids… That I can do.  An aspidochelone is different.”
Inside, Castiel follows Dean into Missouri’s kitchen, where he breathes in fragrant air laden with sage and rosemary and lavender.  Bundles of drying herbs hang from the ceiling and a partially plucked chicken sits on the table in the center of the room, feathers dotting the floor.  The kitchen is run-down but clean and homey, and Castiel thinks he’d likely feel comfortable here if it weren’t for Frank hovering in the doorway watching him with his gun still dangling at his side.
Dean wipes sweat from his upper lip, surveying the area.  The crew is filing down the gangplank past them, eagerly dashing off to rum-soaked taverns, brothels, and other familiar haunts.  Only Bobby and Rufus stay put, waiting for the captain to return.  They have errands to run
Dean nods in understanding, a shadow of guilt rippling over his face.  “That was hard for you to hear.”
Donna shrugs her business-suit jacket off her shoulders.  “Well, okey dokey, then.  How do we kill ‘em?”
“Sorry, are you… are you Deaf?” he stammers.
He returns to the creaky mattress and scratchy sheets, but refuses to close his eyes until Dean comes back from the bathroom nearly twenty minutes later.  Cas’s heart is still beating far too quickly for him to sleep, and when Dean finally slips into bed, rolling over to face away from Cas with his shoulders pulled in tight, it only makes Cas worry more.
Jack turns slowly to look back at Sam, the glowing veins spreading further down his neck, and a half-vacant smile crosses his mouth.  “Like I can do anything,” he replies softly.
They arrive at the meadow just before sunset, when the summer light is fading into gold.  Donna’s truck is there, and Claire’s Fox Body Mustang, and even from a distance they can see two blonde heads working to collect firewood.  When Eileen pulls the van to a stop beside the truck, Donna and Claire pause their work to greet them.
“And we’re thinking about retiring.”  He shifts uncomfortably, cracking his knuckles.  “You know, living like normal people.”
Dean thunders back down the staircase in bare feet and swim trunks.  “Come on, Dad!” he shouts as he runs past, through the kitchen and out the back door.
Dean kicks Sam lightly on the foot.  “Hey, you okay?”
Dean plasters on his best
Tortuga smells like low tide, rotting fish, manure, and the body odor of a hundred ocean-bound men all rolled into one aroma so thick it could be cut with a knife.  Granted, most harbors in both Europe and the Americas smell less than sweet, but Tortuga has a particularly hellish sourness to it.  Castiel breathes through his mouth to combat it, but then he can taste it, which is worse.
Cas only tilts his head back and quirks a stern eyebrow.  “You’ve been up for well over twenty-four hours,” he admonishes.  “Even if you’re not too tired, I doubt you’d be much fun.”
The ship noses down, down, down until the anchor chain wrests the winch free, and it tears through the splintered gap in the hull with a crash.  The
The island groans and bucks, and Inias screams, losing his footing.  He tumbles down the slope of rock and splashes into the water.
A tinny bell over the door to the clinic jingles softly when they walk in.  Dean frowns, surprised at the homey interior.  There’s a front desk and a secretary, but the rest of the lobby — if it can be called a lobby — is made up of squashy patched-up armchairs and a ratty couch, a scuffed coffee table, and piles of outdated magazines.  A few narrow doors lead off from the main room, nameplates designating them as offices, and a staircase leads up to a second level in the back.
A brief shadow of surprise flits over Cas’s face, but it’s gone as quickly as it appeared.  He does as he’s asked, and stands back up from the table.
This fic is tied in to my other works:
.”  He twists in his seat to call over his shoulder.  “Hey, Lilah!  What is this stuff?”
He frowns, tilting his head to see it better in the limited light.  The scars are thick, a few years old at least, and criss-crossing over each other in long tendrils.  Castiel can only see an inch or so of them and can’t tell what they might be from, but he can see that the scars stretch downward beneath Dean’s shirt, further than what’s visible at the moment.
,” the douen says, and Dean freezes instantly.  Color drains from his face.  The douen’s voice is abruptly human again, and eerily calm.  At last it manages to stand, drawing itself upward as it speaks softly in a woman’s voice.  “
“So you heard about his body washing up in South Portland.”
He presses a kiss to the back of Cas’s neck, and something gold and granted unfurls inside Cas’s chest.  Dean is rarely one to initiate this much physical contact, even in private, but it’s helping Cas to ground, to feel more connected to the world underneath him.
Jack presses his mouth into a thin line.  “Does this seem like bailing to you?”
Dean’s expression flattens, his mouth tightening.  Here in the dimness of the hold, the shadows on his face make him look older, harsher.  “You don’t want to know.”
The woods grow darker and darker as they walk, until they’re surrounded by such a heavy, dense blackness that nothing is visible beyond the light of Frank’s torch.  The flame only illuminates a few feet ahead, and their speed drags.
” Donna cuts through the haze, snapping Sam back into the present.  “
Cas lifts his head, regarding Dean with a mildly perplexed expression.  “What do you mean?” he asks as his touch roams across Dean’s stomach, his sides, his hips.
Castiel chews on this thoughtfully for a few minutes, and the table falls quiet apart from the knives peeling and chopping.  He strains his ears and tries to hear what Dean and Missouri might be talking about in the other room, then quickly stops when he realizes that Missouri would likely be able to tell he was eavesdropping.
No, he’s not alone, and he chides himself for thinking it every time the idea crops up, but it still burrows into his brain and makes a nest there.
The details are unimportant.  Sam is silent as Donna explains the case she and Claire were working in Denver, that it was a pack of Nachzehrers gone rogue, that Cas came along to help and was killed for his efforts.  That somehow, the monster got ahold of Cas’s gun and he was gone before they knew it.
yes, we’re gonna do that to Eileen,” Dean says.  “But this time, we have to film it.”
“Is this…
“Well, okay then.  I guess you’ll have to finally start using the dresser in your room.”
, Dean—
“So you can read my thoughts?” Castiel asks.
He plants a wordless kiss on Cas’s mouth, and he thinks he might not care if Sam were to walk in this time.
Breathing hard, Dean is startlingly aware of the fact that he’s already half naked while Cas is still fully clothed, and a glimmer of hesitancy tugs at the back of his head.  With Cas’s hands pinning Dean’s wrists to the bed, somehow expertly pushing every one of Dean’s buttons, he realizes that Cas has been playing this movie, running over this exact scenario in his head for
Pressing a kiss to Dean’s shoulder blade, Cas sinks a slick finger into him, knuckle-deep, and Dean cries out and grips the headboard.
“I’m not going over the bees with you again,” Cas replies evenly, though he crinkles his nose affectionately in Dean’s direction before stepping over to Sam.  He takes the tape from Sam’s hand and slides it back into the stereo, clicking it shut and pressing
Dean feels like a complete asshole.  “Maybe we should have talked about this years ago.”
“We’re close,” Frank says, his nose wrinkling like he’s just eaten a moldy piece of fruit.  “Stinks like a trash pit.”
He’s gone crazy, he thinks.  He’s recklessly driving his dead boyfriend’s car, trying to jolt a ghost to appear among the living, and he’s wearing nothing but a t-shirt and boxers.  What the hell
Dean refuses.  “No, I won’t be able to sleep.  Might as well stay here.”
It’s strongly fragrant, and abruptly the air in the library is heavily perfumed, sweet and herbal.  In any other context, it would make Dean hungry.  Now, it makes him sick.
He watches Sam methodically sift through the texts, mouthing words to himself as he reads, and feels a surge of anger.  Sam lost Eileen, too.  And Donna.  And Charlie.  And
“Really?” Dean asks about the peyote.  “He’s going to be stoned?”
He then pulls his flask from his inner jacket pocket and takes a swig, squinting up at the sky.  “It’s getting late.  We should check out the sanitation department and do some of our own snooping before the police get in the way.”
“I’ve lost track.”
He stares just a bit too long, and Cas notices.  “What?”
At this point, it’s past noon and Dean and Eileen are already hungry again.  The four of them return to Monument Square and sit on the granite steps below the statue of Nike, eating sandwiches from a small deli that faces the square.  Again, Sam orders nothing besides a black coffee, which makes unease tug at the pit of Eileen’s stomach.
With the addition of Jack’s blood, the cauldron spits and sparks and makes the three of them flinch.  “Your turn, Jack,” Sam says, though he’s eyeing the cauldron to make sure it doesn’t do anything else unexpected.
A roaring, gaping black hole appears in the wall, and Dean nearly vomits from the pulse of sheer
Dean tosses in bed, the sheets tangled around his legs.  He’s sure that Sam and Cas are both snoring away in their respective rooms, and he’s annoyed that he can’t seem to do the same.  There’s a lump in his pillow from the gun he keeps under it, bothering him for the first time.  He yanks the pistol out from under the pillow and shoves it into the end table drawer by his bed, then drops his head back down and closes his eyes and
Dean’s eyelids slip closed.  A soft “Mm” sound comes up from his chest, his body sinking into the mattress.
Missouri shoulders past Dean and Patience, and Frank lurches to his feet, seizing his gun from the table.  Castiel stands too, suddenly wishing he still had the copper cutlass, but he’d left it on the
a larger picture, even if you can’t see it, even if it’s not planned out by me or Chuck or anything else.  You have lived for millions of years, and now you’re human.  In the grand scope of things, do you really think a human life is such a long time to wait?”
The four black trash bags are still sitting on the sidewalk, untouched.  Cas tilts his head in surprise.
Missouri plants her hands on her sizeable hips and fixes Frank with a scathing look.  “Frank, I do not need to test them to know they are who they say they are,” she chides.  “Now, quit your whining and be a good host.  Come on in, boys.”
Doing his best to not wake Garth, Castiel carefully climbs out of his hammock and pulls on his own boots.  In all likelihood, Dean’s simply gone up to the deck to take a piss, but something about knowing monsters are lurking unseen in the waters below has Castiel more anxious than he used to be.  He tiptoes out of the crew quarters and creeps up the steps onto the deck.
he’s been through before, and none of them had left a mark on his body.  And this one stupid,
whether he needs to heal Dean or not; the fact is that he
Once the Empty spat him back out like an offending watermelon seed, Cas got one or two clothing items from Dean, but he mostly wears castoffs from Sam.  Wearing Dean’s clothes feels too quick, too intimate for where they are right now, whatever label-less thing they have.
Instantly, their entire party stops.  Dean’s arms tighten protectively around Jean-Luc, and Frank twists on his heel, holding the torch aloft.  At his back, Castiel feels Feliciana go absolutely still, her grip rigid.
The island gives a great, terrible shudder, a sound coming up from the earth below like a thousand-year-old fury.
Dean chokes on his coffee.  “What?”
Castiel pays Frank little mind, and instead reaches to touch Dean’s forearm.  “Are you all right?”
“You don’t have to be sorry,” Dean says, because he can
“What now?” he asks as the captain goes to pay the docking fee to the harbormaster.
the object rip out of Dean’s flesh, scraping past bone and tendon and muscle.  Worse still, the motion drives the last bit of air in Dean’s lungs out in a hollow exhale, and for a single excruciating moment Cas thinks Dean is still breathing.  This is what Sam couldn’t do.  He couldn’t listen to this.
Sam opens his mouth to explain further, but the door swings open behind them, letting a cold gust of wind follow them in.  A short middle-aged woman enters from the street, her winter coat and skirt buffeted by the breeze, legs hidden inside knee-high leather boots.  “Whew!” she shivers, giving herself a shake as she steps into the warmth.
“It has a crust!  It’s pie!” Dean snarls over his shoulder as he stalks away.
Cas and Eileen wave to him from a corner booth.  They’re both in civilian clothes and they’ve stashed their press badges in their pockets.  Dean hasn’t
“Quit looking at me like that,” Dean says, spitting a glob of toothpaste into the sink, but there’s no bite in his tone.  He just sounds tired.
November is hardly the most forgiving month in Maine.  The sun sets early and rises late, the autumn long faded and the snow yet to fall, leaving the landscape a muddy mix of bleak grays and browns.  Puddles splinter on the sidewalks and the wind is punishing.
Cas chuckles, shutting the door behind him.  “You’re getting ahead of yourself,” he says.  “It’s not even Thanksgiving yet.”
Then, unprompted, Dean begins to hum.
”  Not understanding, it’s all Castiel can do to hold her and hope he can keep her safe for the rest of the journey back to town.
“Whoa, whoa, hey,” Sam quickly stops him, stepping out onto the deck.  He reaches for Cas’s shoulder.  “What’s going on?  Are you okay?”
Castiel follows his gaze back down, and his heart nearly stops.
Eileen grips her machete and signs to Dean and Cas with her other hand, “Sam and I go left, you two go right.  Be careful.”
or maybe that’s the wail of the oncoming car’s horn.
There’s a single, lonely gray hair poking from his temple.  There are creases in the corners of his eyes.  A slight sagging to his cheeks.  Were those always there?  Did he just not see them because he was too far above the humanity of his own vessel to notice them?  Or, now that he’s free of grace, is his age catching up with him in fast-forward?
stalling is nagging in the back of his head.
Above them, the island ridge is sinking too, arching like the great fin of a shark.  The churning waves wash over the edge of the dinghy, pulling at the oars until they’re torn from the locks.  There’s debris in the water — shredded wood and ropes and torn canvas — and bodies flail in the riptide, passing too quickly for Castiel to tell who they are.
Dean grunts in the back of his throat, refusing to move.  “Two more minutes.”
that Castiel would be useless, so he nods.  “Yes, I can work.”
did you get that?”
“Progressing quickly,” Cas answers.  “It’s werewolves.  We’re pretty sure there’s a whole pack nearby.  After lunch, we’re going to ask around and see if we can figure out where they’re hiding.”
Stunned, Sam finally points to her.  “Eileen’s here,” he says.
Dean barely glances at the menu before ordering burgers for himself and Cas, while Eileen requests fish and chips.  Lilah whisks back behind the bar.
“They’re bringing him to Lebanon,” Sam signs.  “I have to be there.”
“Yes, sir.”
Sam sets the blade he’d been working on back down on the tabletop.  “I figure if we’re hunting a vamp nest, there’s no harm in making sure everything’s ready.”
“Aspidochelone,” Dean supplies.
Cas scratches behind his ear.  “Once Sam gets back, we should look into places the victim frequently visited.  It’s possible the vampire knew him.”
Cas’s mouth twitches, pressing into a thin line like he doesn’t believe what he’s hearing.
Cas watches him over the rim of his coffee cup.  “How are you doing?”
Just as quickly as she’d returned to them, Feliciana dashes back to her parents, who take her back to the safety of her home with a last grateful look over their shoulders.

Dean cuts him off, though he’s not angry, or even upset.  If anything, he seems amused.  “First of all, time runs a little different here than on Earth, so it’s been a while but it hasn’t been
the cookie tells him.
The words echo in his head, over and over, louder and louder, until it’s all Dean can hear.  It’s not the first time Cas has said it, but this was so different from before.
The sun is already sinking close to the horizon when Dean parks the Impala on the street outside the waste management parking lot, a fenced-in grid of pungent trucks laid out a decent distance from the city proper to keep the smell from bothering residents.  Overhead the sky glows orange and gold, the day drawing to a close before it’s even five o’clock, and it feels like they’ve had barely any daylight at all.  The temperature is quickly dropping again as they climb out of the car.  Eileen shivers and huddles close to Sam’s side while Dean digs through the arsenal in the Impala’s trunk, handing a machete to each of them.
“Yeah.”  He stops and leans back through the driver’s side window.
me!” the Empty squeals in Cas’s own distorted voice.  “Ohh, I am so, so tired of dealing with you, Castiel.  You are a
“Hey,” he says, making a beeline for the coffee pot.  “Since when do you do dishes?”
A glimmer of hope surges in Dean’s stomach, but he tries desperately to tamp it down.  He can’t forget the risks, nor can he ignore all the reasons this plan may not work.  They want to give Jack Dreamwalker abilities, but Dean knows all too well that that kind of magic – even temporary magic – comes with a price.  Not to mention, Dreamwalking is meant for peering into other worlds, but the Empty
He pauses in the hunting section for long enough to pick out a knife for Cas.  It’s not anything special as far as a hunter’s arsenal is concerned — Wal-Mart doesn’t exactly carry their typical grade of weapons — but it’s quality steel with a blade that pivots into its handle and a clip to attach it to a belt or a pocket.  It’s similar to the one Dean carries for minor tasks, like cutting rope or slicing his hand for a sigil.
, and yet it’s obscenely loud in the silence of the garage.  Cas sits still with his heart thudding away in his chest and his ears ringing.
In the morning, he’s woken by Dean lightly punching him in the shoulder.  He jolts awake, hammock swinging.  Dean is standing over him with a grin.  He’s shrugged a plain black waistcoat over his shirt, leaving it hanging unbuttoned, and he’s holding Castiel’s boots in hand.
“Yeah,” is all Dean can say.
, Dean.  Quit it,” Cas spits with a glare, and even as he says it he immediately regrets it.
The frown line between Cas’s brows only deepens.  “...Yes?” he says carefully, perplexed more than anything else.  “He’s known for a while, Dean.”
“You— Your
And that’s that.
“Gonna stop in on a friend,” Dean answers without elaborating.  “After lunch.  You hungry?”
Sam draws a
Frank makes a face at him, a gratuitous roll of the eyes, but snorts and wipes a drop of blood from his cheek as he stomps off in the same direction the douen had run.
Eileen shrugs.  She’s not the type to make assumptions at the beginning of an investigation.  Whatever answers are out there, she’s certain they’ll stumble onto them eventually.
Castiel breathes deeply, wrinkling his nose when he realizes that Inias is right.  A strange odor hangs heavy over the island, not just salt and earth but something else too.  Something sour, like mud flats at low tide or decaying piles of fish guts at a monger’s.
Dean pants, rolling onto his back and clutching the nape of his neck.  “Thanks, Cas,” he says breathlessly.
“I told her we’d take two specials,” Cas says, studying the crappy wall decor and the grizzled patrons lined up at the counter.  It’s warm and comfortable here; exactly the sort of place someone might want to start their morning before spending the rest of their day working out in the bitter cold.  A newspaper sits at the end of the counter, and Cas slides out of the booth for a moment to steal it.
anomaly.”  The maniacal smile drips away.  “You broke your promise.”
He shifts to fifth, letting the Impala’s wheels drift over the yellow line.
Cas continues to hunt, as do Sam and Eileen.  Years drag by in little more than a blink.  Cas gradually learns sign language, which helps on cases so that they can all communicate silently, but most importantly it means that Cas and Eileen can make teasing jokes about Sam when his back is turned.  They still have movie nights and game nights, and other hunters breeze through the bunker in search of help or a place to lay their head for a while.  It takes a long time, but Cas does manage to smile and laugh and have fun in the small moments, because he knows some days that’s all that’s keeping the grief at bay.
Cas blanches.  “Hell?” he asks.  It’s the only thing he can think of that’s worse – nearly endless pain and torture rather than an eternity of nothingness – but Hell will only delay his return to the Empty, not prevent it.
Cas frowns, eyes still closed, and makes a noise of protest low in his throat.  His arm cinches tighter.
“It’s time to go, Castiel,” Jack says, standing back with his hand on Cas’s chest.
Castiel is out of breath with exertion and terror, and he glances over his shoulder to see that Dean has beheaded the other mermaid on the prow.  Its severed head sits where it rolled a couple yards away, its body lying akimbo and leaking dark blood onto the planks.
Cas can sense Dean smiling as he says, “
Inside, they find a gruesome scene – some poor young woman whose heart was ripped out so violently that her blood splattered on the ceiling.  Eileen stares down at the body on the floor, her mouth twitching in a pang of sadness, before she signs a single word to Castiel:  “Werewolf.”
, while a fire-and-brimstone preacher shouts to a nonexistant crowd.  A handful of homeless folks tuck themselves into corners — benches in Congress Square, the art museum steps, a bus stop, the doorway to what used to be a Dunkin’s.  As Dean drives down the hill toward the water, he has to stop to let a man in steampunk fashion cross the street.
“I thought we killed them all,” Castiel hisses.
The front of a ship.  Bow refers to the entire front, while prow specifically means the front portion above the waterline, however they are mostly interchangeable.

little bite is going to scar.
“Sam can do the rest,” Cas replies idly, brushing past Dean and heading for the hallway.
The officer shuffles slightly, clearing his throat.  “Sorry.”
Lilah only shrugs at Dean’s dry remark, her arms crossed.  “We have a business to run.  I’ll give him a bit of food if we have anything about to expire, but I can’t do much else for him.”  She studies his photograph thoughtfully.  “He’s always seemed like a nice dude.  Just a lot of problems, you know?”
There’s no response from Cas – he’s still staring at Dean, still bewildered.  He has no idea what the hell Dean’s talking about.
He hesitates, but finally returns to the bed and sits beside Dean, pointedly keeping his hands to himself.
pierces his ears, and the dinghy, unable to hold itself together against the power of the ocean, breaks apart.  Castiel catches Ishim’s eye and has no time to say any kind of farewell before the water rushes up to greet them.
On screen, they watch as the figure of a man in boots and a heavy jacket lugs four large black trash bags from the direction of the wharf.  He approaches the side of the road, then leaves all four bags beside a big pile of purple garbage bags awaiting collection and walks off back to the dock.
“It was nothing,” Cas replies evenly, gazing back out the window at the trees blurring past the window.  “Endless nothing.”
Cas reaches up and presses another kiss, quicker this time, to the corner of Dean’s mouth.  It’s enough to make Dean relax, his shoulders falling as the tension sweeps away.  “But maybe not here,” Cas adds, briefly squeezing Dean’s wrist before letting go.
“Enough chit-chat,” Frank cuts in, holding up the torch he’s made.  It casts a bright orange glow over them all, beating back the evening gloom and throwing the trees into shadow.  “Let’s go.”
Why hasn’t Dean told him?
“Everyone?” Sam echoes.  “You mean—?”
“Nah,” Sam waves off his concern.  “We don’t have the doorbell lights in our bedroom.  And as for Dean, the kid sleeps through everything.”
“Why?”
He gives her a smile and squeezes her hand, but it’s all he can manage in the moment.  The bunker doesn’t quite seem real around them, the surfaces intangible and the air ill-fitted to the space.  He was only here a month ago to help Cas with re-organizing the archives and nothing’s changed, not really, but for the first time in nearly fifteen years it doesn’t feel like home.
Sam is quiet again, digesting this new information.  Dean can practically hear the gears in Sam’s head spinning away.  He’s struggling to figure out how to put his thoughts into words, and all Dean wants is for Sam to either hurry up and say what he has to say or go back inside and leave Dean in the dark.
They’re only half right – one of them has fangs, the other is just a girl with a trust fund and a bitchy attitude.  And after they’ve killed the first, when Cas tries to corner the other outside of a bar after she spends the evening partying, the second vetala swoops in from behind him and knocks him into the brick wall, sinking her teeth into his neck.  The trust fund girl screams at the top of her lungs and runs as fast as is humanly possible while wearing six-inch stilettos.
“Since when do you like cheesecake?”
Castiel isn’t given the space to ask anything further; Dean turns and leans down to give Missouri a farewell hug.
The wind returns with the sunrise, and just after dawn Castiel climbs aloft with Garth to unfurl the sails.  The
“I guess you’re right,” Sam agrees, leaning back in his chair.  He watches the sailboat on the lake pull up to a dock.
“It’s getting late.”  Dean eyes the sky overhead where it’s beginning to darken, night creeping in from the east.  “I say we find a motel, get a couple of rooms, get started on the case again tomorrow.”
As the sun dips down and evening sweeps back in, the

Dean huffs a wobbly, almost delirious laugh at the memory.  “Yeah, and you blew it.  Funniest thing I’ve ever seen.”
…and he rips the air apart.
He finds Cas standing rigid and silent, leaning back against the kitchen counter, a white baker’s box sitting open behind him.  Cas is staring at the wall with a faraway look in his eyes, holding a small plate in one hand and a fork in the other.  A slice of peanut butter and jelly cheesecake sits on the plate with only a single bite taken out of it, Cas’s fork scraping absentmindedly on the ceramic as if he’s completely forgotten the cake is even there.  He hasn’t noticed Sam.
“You all right?” Cas asks.  “Are your eyes bothering you?”
Castiel frowns, lifting his head and glancing around the cabin.  The other men are all sleeping soundly, and he knows Dean isn’t on night duty since he’d seen him working all day.  Dean’s boots are missing from the floor by his hammock.
“Sure is good to see you, kid,” Bobby says to Dean, his red face redder in the torchlight.
wink in the sunlight.  “Do what?”
Eileen refrains from poking fun at Dean’s lack of sign language comprehension; it’s not as funny as it was yesterday.  Instead, she only raises her hands placatingly.  “Sorry,” she says, and changes the subject.  “I think we should check out Preble Street right after this, while they’re still serving breakfast.  People are going to scatter if we wait too long.”
Sam is watching Jack with more than a little worry.  “How do you feel?”
“Sound the alarm.”
“Are you laughing?”
Cas leans back on the bench, resting his coffee on the wood slats beside him.  “You never wanted to raise a child in the hunter’s life.  With Jack, there wasn’t a choice.  With Dean, there is.  I’ve known you were going to quit hunting since you told me Eileen was expecting.”
“Great,” mutters Dean.  “Well, if we’re not back by sundown, you’ll, y’know…?
in all directions.
—” Dean whines, a tone he’d be embarrassed by if he weren’t so achingly turned on.
No.  This is too important.  Havana can wait.  Castiel cuts Dean off swiftly and decisively.  “I’m not going anywhere.  I’m helping.”
“Anything?” Castiel whispers.
Sam smiles to himself and leaves, heading down the corridor to his room to call Eileen.
“If it makes you feel any better,” Patience continues, “seeing only the future means I don’t know anything else about you.”
Cinching the robe around his hips, Dean walks as quickly and quietly as he can.  Fortunately, when he slinks past the open door to the TV room, Sam is entirely focused on the rapid gunfire and bloodcurdling screams coming from the movie, and Dean is able to slip by unnoticed.
Sam shrugs with one shoulder, still grinning, but drops the accent.  “Eileen disagrees.”

Blade at the ready, Dean creeps to the bulward, peering tentatively into the water, then back to Castiel’s side.
Something tugs at his gut, and he opens his mouth to ask Dean about them, but Dean speaks first, seemingly unaware of Castiel’s observation.
“No, never,” he answers resolutely.  “I’m not interested in doing anything you’re uncomfortable with.”
Sam shakes his head, distracted by the Nazi getting clubbed to death onscreen.  “No, thanks, we already ate.”
“Cas,
“You must take after your mother,” Castiel bluntly states, then chides himself for not holding his tongue.  He has a feeling that Dean is the sole reason he’s still alive, that the captain wouldn’t have stopped to fish him out of the water.  And here he is, being rude.
This isn’t Dean.  It’s an empty shell, his soul already gone.  He’s not standing.  He’s
The edges of his vision blur as lightheadedness sweeps in.  He can feel his legs about to give out, but there’s no time to do anything about it.
The upper edge of the hull that comes above the deck, forming essentially a rail around the deck and keeps water from washing onto the ship.
Finally, Cas’s hips stutter and lock.  He comes undone with a groan and collapses, trembling and still pressed deep inside, onto Dean’s chest.
“Get up!” Dean urges him.
Mr. Singer turns and quirks an eyebrow at the rest of the crew.  “What’re you idjits standing around gawking for?  Get back to work!”
Sam nods, and Cas shakes his head in wonder.
Dean eventually falls into his bed sometime around dawn, more than a little drunk, and lays there in the dark.  He’s exhausted but he still can’t sleep, completely unaccustomed to having nothing looming ahead – no new fights, no monsters, nothing in the entire pantheon of the world coming to try and devour them.  There will still be cases, the occasional werewolf or vampire or djinn, but all of that seems trivial now, barely a blip on the radar.  Tomorrow (or rather later today) he’s going to wake up and he’ll have nothing to do.
“Sir, it’s four in the morning on a Sunday.  We can’t sell alcohol until noon.”
” comes Frank’s voice from outside, muffled through the den walls.
Frank, a wild-eyed twitchy man with bristling gray sideburns, keeps the gun aimed directly at Dean’s nose.  “The hell do you want?”
The little girl wriggles through next, skirt catching on twigs as she comes through the tunnel on her hands and knees.  Castiel grabs her under the arms the moment he’s able, hauling her the rest of the way and sending her after Jean-Luc.
“Keep your wits about you,” Dean says over his shoulder as the terrain steepens.  “These things are fast.”
Robin glances at the photo for only half a second, arms still crossed.  “If he has, you should know that federal patient privacy laws prevent me from discussing our patient’s care without a warrant.”  Their eyebrows shoot upwards, challenging.  “
“Sorry,” Dean says, and Castiel frowns, because if there’s anybody who should apologize, it’s not Dean.  “My father can be… an acquired taste.”
Castiel is struck suddenly with the weight of what they’ve just done, the half-eaten child’s body and the scattered bones in the den looming large in his head.  However many children had been taken and not survived, they’ve managed to save two, which is no small thing.  He shudders to think of the douen continuing to hunt and feed its offspring unchecked.  He doesn’t doubt that a great many more children would have been killed, had the
“Mr. Singer!” says the captain, turning to an older bearded man standing to his right.  “I’m sure you’ll do the honors, since Dean is not so inclined.”
A breath of relief rushes from Castiel’s lungs.  “Is she hurt?”
“Alright, so… vamps,” remarks Dean.  “Not bad for our first case after Chuck.”
Dean’s knuckles are white around the hilt of his silver knife, jaw set in determination as he moves in for the kill strike.
Jack glares at him.  “That’s not what you were doing, and you know it.”
is too many losses for Dean to wrap his head around, and it still feels comparatively minor.
“Right,” stammers Castiel.  “Thank you.  For saving me.”
Dean smiles, relieved that the tension is beginning to dissipate.  He doesn’t think he could handle feeling awkward around Cas for much longer.  The easiest way forward would be to keep joking, to eventually get to a point where they can forget Cas ever said anything (impossible), and to return to the way their friendship was before.  But he also believes what he said, that he owes Castiel his honesty, and so he draws a deep breath and takes a risk.
“If you’ll
Canvassing is an agonizingly slow process.  Several are too high or drunk to respond coherently to the simplest questions, and several more flat-out refuse to speak with them at all.  Armed only with notepads and pens, they slog their way through round after round of questioning.  Eileen takes copious notes while chatting with a friendly pregnant woman who looks like she’s not had access to a shower in weeks.  Across the street Dean talks to a swaying drunkard, while Sam patiently listens to the disjointed ramblings of an elderly schizophrenic woman.  Cas kneels on the sidewalk to speak with a man who picks constantly at his skin, riddled with the visible symptoms of a meth habit.
with Dean.  Or he thinks Dean isn’t ready to talk about it (he’s right).  Every word is hesitant, stammered.
Because when has death
“Nah, they’re watching gory movies and Eileen’s already passed out in a pizza coma,” Dean replies with a flap of his hand, leaning on the counter.
Cas has already refocused his attention on his book, and it takes him an embarrassingly long moment to realize that he’s… still holding Dean’s hand.
“Well, that’s a bit out of our way,” the captain says, as if Castiel had insolently asked for help getting there.  “We can drop you off in Tortuga.  That’s our next stop.”
“Is this really your last visit?”
Cas’s heart lurches in his chest, the smile vanishing as quickly as it appeared.  Something shatters within his core.
“Yeah, the Preble Street Resource Center,” Maryann clarifies, scribbling an address onto a Post-It and handing it to Sam.  “Most of the homeless folks in Portland hang around that area.  It’d probably be a good place to start.”
“Seriously?” Sam asks, incredulous.  “You’ve been here over thirty years and you haven’t—”
.  Alastair’s voice is sickly sweet, the squeal of a knife through bone, butterflies feeding on rotting meat.  Dean can barely hear the screams any more.
He blinks, shaking his head as his vision goes glassy and blurred at the edges.  “For what?”
.  “Caught you flinching,” he taunts, adopting a lilting accent that sounds only vaguely German-esque.
He opens the fridge to find the mac and cheese wrapped and sitting on a shelf, untouched.  Sam or Eileen must have put it fully away at some point last night.  He moves it to the side and digs out the carton of eggs and the packet of bacon, stomach rumbling loud enough to remind him that he’d never actually eaten dinner.  He gets a rudimentary breakfast spread together, humming absentmindedly to himself in the quiet of the kitchen.
The pit of Cas’s stomach goes cold, ice spreading through his veins.  “Sam, what happened?”
After a moment of silence, the door slams open and a cocked pistol is leveled at Dean’s face.
They find Dean and Cas four rows over, standing at the rear of one of the trucks.  The license plate matches the one from the security camera footage.  Dean runs the beam of his flashlight over the compactor and shudders.
Eileen sinks down to sit on the lowest stair.  Distantly, Sam can hear Dean in the yard, shouting something to an imaginary nemesis and practicing the moves he’s learned at karate as he jumps through the sprinkler.
Castiel blinks.  Dean has halted midsentence and is now staring at him, his brow knitted in concern.  Clearing his throat, Castiel realizes he’s been glaring at the wood slats under his feet, barely listening.  Rather than reply to Dean’s question, he asks one of his own, tight and accusing.  “Are you going to explain what that was about?”
The night has only gotten darker and it's difficult to see much detail at all, but Eileen doesn't miss the look of surprise that takes over Sam's features.
“Maybe you could help us out, then?” Sam prompts, drawing Fred Sargent’s mugshot from his pocket.  “We understand that this man has been a patient here.”
“Thanks,” Dean says as they reach the waterfront.  “For sticking up for me, I mean.  It was unnecessary.  But thanks.”
It occurs to Castiel fleetingly as the douen drops onto Frank’s back that it’s smaller than he expected.  And it is fast.
The injured douen’s path follows a more direct route now, cutting through the sparser areas of the woods and making it much easier for the three men to track.  Frank’s face grows redder and more puckered with each step, his complaints of the douen “stinking to high heaven” ever more frequent.
.  Dean blinks and there’s a cold beer on the table in front of him, but he can’t touch it when all he feels is nausea.  Sam is sitting next to him, a strong hand solidly on Dean’s shoulder, but Dean can’t hear anything he’s saying.  Or maybe he’s not saying anything.  Dean doesn’t know one way or the other.  He feels lost in a way that he’s never felt before, even on his worst days.
Eventually, Jack comes back into the library and wakes them up, announcing that he’s ready.  Sam stands, digging the heel of his hand into his eyes and yanking his hair away from his face.  Dean senses a newfound wave of dread swirling in the pit of his stomach; he’s suddenly sure this plan won’t work.
Is this supposed to be normal for humans, he wonders, to just be in a shitty mood for absolutely no logical reason?  Because it’s
“An aspido— aspidochelone,” Castiel replies, still stumbling over the word but managing for the first time to say it in its entirety.
morning talking to them.”
Sam huffs.  “Fine, I’ll go to the station and you three can get lunch.”
There are already a number of people out and about, heading to work or ducking into coffee shops that are just opening their doors.  Eileen watches a man push a shopping cart full of empty plastic bottles across Congress Street, and spots another curled up inside a sleeping bag in the doorway to a consignment shop.
At last, he’s able to sit up without hitting his head on something, though the space is still claustrophobic.  He can hear Dean squeezing through the tunnel after him, and clumsily shuffles out of the way.  There’s a crunch and a clatter underneath him as he moves, a pile of objects shifting.  It’s a jagged surface he kneels on, like the packed dirt floor is halfway mixed with gravel.
As they reach the dock, Dean pauses.  “I don’t think there’ll be any inns taking guests at this time of night.  You might as well stay the night with us,” he says, then quickly offers Castiel an out.  “Unless, of course, you don’t want to.  I know we’ve given you enough excitement over the last few days.”
A full-body tremor courses over Dean’s frame and he staggers back like he’s been struck in the chest.  His shoulders go rigid, and Castiel sees sweat drip from the nape of his neck and roll down to the collar of his shirt.

kill the monsters without losing anyone?  Or are you just ignoring it?” he spits.
“Okay.”
The den is only a dozen or so yards further, and Castiel can’t keep his jaw from dropping when he sees it.  He’d expected a cave, perhaps, or some kind of burrow — something that matched the douen’s short stature and would allow it to drag its prey to a safe, hidden place to be devoured.
“I love you too.”
“I knew taking him for ice cream after his appointment was a bad idea,” Eileen signs to Sam as she circles around the nose of the van.  “He’s loaded with sugar.”
to Eileen in the other room, the words follow Cas down the corridor like some kind of bat, clawing at his shoulders, flapping at his head, gnawing at his neck.
Alastair’s hand — abruptly solid — courses over the small of Dean’s flayed back.  Instinctively, Dean squirms and leans into the sensation, gasping and shivering, honing in on the first real touch he’s felt in decades.  The muscles in his wrists tear, barely a blip against the sea of pain roiling in every stripped nerve.  Alastair’s forehead — that’s new, too; since when does Alastair have any parts not made of smoke? — presses to Dean’s, his voice thrumming in the pit of Dean’s bleeding stomach.
Sam’s almost equally fatigued but masks it better, all business, rigid and official as he flashes his badge and tells the coroner they’d like to see the autopsy results.
Castiel frowns at him in surprise.  In his other hand, Dean’s holding a second pie.  “Where did you get that?”  Castiel glances over his shoulder, down the line of stalls and booths they’ve passed but not stopped at.  “
“I mean, neither of us are exactly experienced here,” Dean continues.  A small laugh jumps out of his chest.  “Although you could’ve fooled me.”
“Turn over,” Cas sighs into Dean’s ear.  “I want to see you.”
Dean weighs the pros and cons of getting dressed again: the risk of Sam or Eileen catching him in the hallway in a questionable lack of clothing versus the ease of already being practically naked when he gets back, and decides the risk is worth it.  He grabs Cas’s robe from the hook on the wall and, with one final appreciative glance at Cas, stalks out to the hallway.
Sam shrugs.  “I don’t know; couldn’t sleep.  I didn’t wake you up, did I?”
deserve the same thing?”
.  What was the purpose?  What was the point of all this, if this was the result?”
Castiel rows to shore along with the majority of the crew, leaving only Rufus and Bobby on board the
Cas snags a booth near the kitchen while Dean excuses himself to the bathroom, and a girl in combat boots and more earrings than he can count sets a pair of menus down on the table.
“It’s not,” Sam agrees.  “There are welding marks here.  It’s been customized.”
Somehow, it’s both a short and very, very long time before he finds himself standing a few yards away from his own body.  Everything is peaceful and quiet.
“Well, this bite mark — if it is a bite mark — was made before the guy died,” Gagnon explains, straightening back up to his not-so-impressive height and adjusting his heavy glasses on his nose.  “If it was post-mortem, then fine, some fish or eel or something took a nibble while he was floating in the harbor.  But he was bitten first, then surgically dismembered, and
it with you and bees?”
Dean sags on the hooks like a gutted pig, the hand on his throat as tangible as the hot iron making his skin bubble.  Alastair’s fingers squeeze, and it feels warm and attentive as he chokes the breath from Dean’s lungs.
To Castiel’s left, Dean is still as a statue, watching the flames.  To his right, Garth is a blubbering mess.
Cas is standing there, rumpled and haloed by moths fluttering to the light hanging over his head.  “Sam, I—” he starts, his tone almost desperate, but he stops short and looks over Sam from head to foot.  “Did I wake you?”
“Eileen loves this movie,” Sam protests, though his words are punctuated by another snore.
“Claire, I don’t know what went down, but I know that it definitely wasn’t your fault,” he says firmly, despite the rock in his throat.
Dean reaches up and clutches at Alastair’s arm, clinging like a child to the first thing to touch him in thirty years that isn’t red-hot metal.  He doesn’t know if Alastair actually feels human or if he’s just too far gone to be able to tell the difference.
poster in response.
He dozes fitfully in and out for an hour or so, and the next time he opens his eyes Dean has left the bed again.
“I told you,” Jack says, softening.  “I’m hands-off.  I won’t interfere.”
Eileen strides into the kitchen as Sam is talking and plops down next to him, immediately reaching over to steal a grape from his plate.  Her hair is still wet from the shower and she’s bright-eyed and fully awake, having already been up for ages so she could go running with Sam.  It’s too much energy for Cas right now, and he has to consciously remind himself that his bad mood has nothing to do with her.
She reaches across the table and lays her hand over his.  “I’m not going to force you to talk about it,” she says.  “But I know better than most that grief doesn’t go away, and I know that
Bobby quirks an eyebrow at him.  “You’ve never seen what a pack of these things can do to a ship that ain’t prepared,” he says solemnly.  “We lost three men out of nineteen.  Yeah, I’d say that’s damn lucky.”
A spark of an idea ignites in the back of Cas’s head.  When Bobby had finally made it through to this side of the Veil, he’d done it by getting angry.
This gives Dean pause, his fork hovering over the last bite of chocolate cream crust.  “Why were you in my room?”
She’s panting, hissing through her giant serrated teeth, and bleeding from the two massive wounds in her torso.  Wounds that would have killed almost anything else.  Cas feels the searing sting of his own injuries – the lacerations in his neck and shoulder, the bite mark on his arm – and he backs up as she inches closer.
Cas frowns, puzzled.  “Why?”
Feliciana looks up at him and smiles.  She’s missing one of her front teeth and the expression appears endearingly lopsided.  “
Cas can’t help but smile, reaching up to tangle his fingers with Dean’s where his left hand is hanging over his shoulder.  “Not too close,” he says.  Heaven’s not his home anymore, after all.  He tilts his jaw up and kisses Dean on the mouth, squeezing his fingers.
“Maybe I’m just finally letting my impatience get the better of me.”  Cas’s voice rumbles over Dean’s skin when he breaks for breath, raising gooseflesh in the shape of handprints wherever he touches.  He pulls Dean down to the mattress and rolls on top of him, his body a solid line of weight across Dean’s chest as he slots their mouths together again.
He reaches for Inias’ shoulder.  “I think we should—” he starts, about to suggest they go back to the
Sam’s phone rings then, interrupting their conversation, and he digs it out of his pocket.  “This is Agent Frantz.”  He listens to the person on the other end for a minute or so before he nods and replies, “Okay, we’ll be there soon.”
Castiel snorts, ripping a bit of peel and tossing it into the ocean.  The sun is on their faces as they lean on the starboard bulward, the
“What’s that?”
It’s quiet in the bunker –
The question jolts through him, and heat pools in his stomach.  He gives up the fight for sleep, kicking the blankets aside, and sits on the edge of the bed with his elbows on his knees.
In the kitchen, he manages not to burn himself as he yanks out the mac and cheese tray and sets it atop the stove to cool, then shuts off the oven.  He dumps the remainders of his and Cas’s beers down the sink, stuffing the empty bottles into the trash.
They head back into the bunker, since the second spell doesn’t require the use of an open fire.  While Sam and Jack are getting ready, Dean sneaks into the kitchen and downs two shots of whiskey.  His hand is shaking as he holds the glass.  He stands there for a minute to allow time for the alcohol to circulate before he returns to join Sam and Jack in the library.
“Well, your father may not want me on the crew after the way I spoke to him tonight,” Castiel acquiesces, making Dean laugh.  “But yes.  I’m sure.”
the only archangel blade they have.  Adding a handful of other things – various herbs and roots with supposedly magical properties – Sam recites something in Enochian that Dean doesn’t understand.  The sun is setting, the sky overhead streaked with pink and orange.
Sam sits, only because his head is practically brushing the ceiling, and leaves Dean on his feet.  “We understand that Fred Sargent was a frequent patient here,” Sam begins, taking Fred’s mugshot out of the police file under his arm and handing it across the desk to Maryann.  “Do you recognize him?”
“Be safe,” Cas tells him, and climbs into the passenger seat of Eileen’s Plymouth Valiant.
Dean is quiet, blade at the ready.
Instantly, Cas freezes.  Something is wrong.
With his mind whirling in circles, eddied by fear and hope and alcohol, he becomes acutely aware that Castiel’s bedroom is only a few doors away down the hall.  They gave Cas one of the extra guest rooms to make into his own now that he actually needs to sleep, and he passed out in a beer coma hours ago, much more of a lightweight than Dean or Sam.  Dean can practically feel Cas’s energy from where he lays, somehow so much more
“Good morning.”
“This is my last visit, Castiel.”

It only takes a couple of weeks to sink into their new normal.  Not just hunting small-time monsters and being relieved when each case doesn’t lead to bigger and badder things, but
Sam’s eyes light up immediately, and Dean wipes tears from the corners of his eyes.
“You okay, man?” Dean asks.
“Still alive,” says Frank with a shrug, and Missouri shakes her head fondly at him.
He unlatches the tailgate with his heart pounding.  There’s a blue tarp covering Cas’s body where it lays next to a large tool box.  Sam allows himself a single nerve-steeling breath, then pushes the tarp aside.  Instantly, he recoils.
He sleeps well that night.
At the sensation of the boat rocking gently under his feet, Castiel breathes a sigh of relief, already feeling more at home than on solid land.  There’s no one else on deck — with the ship moored, there’s no need for anyone at the helm — and the windows to the captain’s cabin are dark.  A few oil lanterns hang from the

so many times.
“The boys?”
Cas breathes out a great sigh, a painful ache blooming in his chest.  He doesn’t know if Jack’s appearance made things better or worse.  He wasn’t ready to say goodbye to Jack, not again.  He’s still not ready to say goodbye to Dean.
Cas’s fork clinks on the plate as he takes one more bite, chewing it with all the enthusiasm of someone eating dirt.
but Sam still wonders if Cas continuing to live in the bunker was the best idea.  As frequent as their visits might be, and however often he might see Jody and Donna and a whole host of other hunters, Sam can’t imagine that Cas doesn’t get lonely.
she texts Cas.
Castiel supposes everyone mourns in their own way.
They pack up changes of clothes and snacks for the road, and just before they head out the door Dean presses a quick goodbye kiss to Cas’s lips.  “I’ll call you from the road.”
Dean swears loudly and viciously when Cas rolls his hips into him.  The action sends a searing pulse of electricity crashing through him, ricocheting from his groin through his chest and back again.  Dean’s fist curls against Cas’s pectoral, tugging his shirt so ferociously that it nearly rips.  The cloth chafes along Cas’s neck and leaves a reddened line under his skin.
Dumb question.
“Then, you can sense the aspidochelone?  You can tell the
When Cas steps back, leaving Dean halfway breathless and staring hungrily at his lips, all he says is, “So.  Dinner?”
She stops in her tracks and touches his arm.  “Are you feeling okay?”
The town of Tortuga is more pleasant late at night, without the heavy aroma of sweat and shit and fish, or the unbearable heat of the sun making the smell worse.  The wind has died down and the island has cooled, stars winking above and the moon swinging near the mountains on the far side of the harbor.
Gagnon makes a face, setting the detached forearm back onto the steel.  “Guy’s in pieces; it’d be weird if he wasn’t drained.  That’s not the interesting part.”  He moves his hands to the severed head, rolling it onto its side.  “
Cas grits his teeth and pointedly returns his attention to his newspaper.  “You don’t have to be rude.”
But it’s still deep, and it still hurts, and it’s going to leave a scar.
“I’m just going to say this,” Jody continues.  “You are
“So,” Dean says through a bite of burger, “any ideas on how to track a vamp nest from a victim found in the ocean?”
“No.”
Surrounded by family, they watch Dean burn away into the atmosphere.
Under the table, Dean nudges Cas’s leg with his knee.
“My brother ran off, couple years ago,” he starts, clearing his throat.  “He wanted to join the seminary.  I didn’t really understand it, but I think he was willing to do anything to get out of what we do.”
Dean glares at Sam, wholly unamused.
There's a scuffle and a wild flailing of flashlight beams when Dean tackles the stranger in a move that would have made the NFL proud.  They crash into the icy ground, and Dean's machete goes flying, clattering several feet away.  Sam instantly joins the fray, seizing the stranger by the back of his coat and flipping him onto his back, Sam's knee on his chest and blade at his throat.
There’s a grating sound of winding chains and every hook in Dean’s body yanks tight.  A scream is torn from his chest like a vine from a tree it’s killing, and he feels lighter and lighter and lighter until he’s ripped into halves.  Three pieces.  Five.  Eight.  Fourteen.  More.
Patience only raises an eyebrow at him.
“Same as the last time you asked me,” Cas replies evenly.  “I feel human.”
” Sam manages to get out, and the only thing Cas can say is that he’ll be there soon.
“Yeah, this is a weird one,” Donna agrees, looking genuinely rattled.
Cas holds up his fake badge, trying to keep a straight face as the rookie blinks rapidly, utterly taken aback.
“Then come on,” Dean says, hoisting him back up to his feet.  “Fight’s not over.”
“All right,” Dean says, but his tone disagrees.  It’s not all right, Dean knows something is up, and they’re going to talk about this later.
“It wasn’t an island,” Dean says solemnly, popping an orange segment into his mouth.  “The creature, the island…”  He shrugs.  “Same thing.”
drain blood, and when newly-turned don’t hide the bodies well.
Frank has a small fire going now at the edge of the den to Castiel’s left.  He rips a larger branch from the wall, one end of it burning, and uses it to spread the flames along the den’s circumference.  Smoke pours upward as the fire climbs toward the treetops.
reaching his ears.  A second ticks past, then another, and Castiel is still alive.
Dean has the sneaking suspicion that Cas isn’t really astonished by any of this, that he’s simply been waiting for Dean to catch up.  So Dean does.  He follows Cas out of the kitchen and down the hall.
She doesn't look behind her to see if they're following, but her legs are shorter than the boys' and Dean quickly overtakes her, then Sam, dashing past and skidding on the gravel as they round a corner.  Dean runs down a row of trucks and vanishes from view momentarily, Sam pounding after him, and reappears as Eileen and Cas race to catch up.
Dean blinks.  “They are.”  His face goes pale then, his hand tightening on Jean-Luc’s shoulder.  “Except when they breed.”
He turns, and in less than an instant feels his skin flush bright red, because Sam and Eileen are standing in the doorway.
“Dean and Sam.”
Sam stops him, forcibly grabbing Dean around the shoulders.  “Dean!  Wait!”
The bag is ripped, no doubt torn open by hungry gulls or curious seals, or perhaps a boat propeller.  Water pours out of the hole in the bag, and Tallie’s arm strains to hold it while it drains.  A foul odor hits her nostrils, pungent even in the wind.
, Castiel had passed long hours watching the open water, daydreaming of mermaids leaping between the waves, as if he could just think hard enough and one would appear.
Cas’s

Eileen frowns.  “Are we sure they’re actually being put in the compactor?” she asks.  Sam is right — if they’re going to the trouble of separating the bodies from the regular trash, then the point must be to save them for some other use, for a specific purpose, and it would be illogical to throw them in with everything else.
Then, Cas does something with his tongue that makes him arch up and stutter out, “Fuck — Cas, I — stop, stop,
bobs violently back up, free of the anchor, but quickly begins to sink again.  She lists to starboard, her masts swing down.
Cas smiles, and kisses him again, and hauls Dean away from the counter and out of the kitchen and, stumbling, down the corridor.
Dean wrenches Castiel back and plants himself in the creature’s line of attack, brandishing his cutlass as it lunges.  It releases a hissing shriek like stone scraping on metal, teeth glistening, and dodges Dean’s sword.
“You want to tell me what that panic attack was about?” Dean murmurs into the back of Cas’s neck.
Castiel somehow doesn’t think that’s the answer — the tide already seems pretty high — but he also can’t think of another explanation.  Looking past the clump of mussels, his eyes widen at the vegetation growing close to the ground.  Shaded under the wooded canopy, he hadn’t noticed it before.
He’s just about to drop back into real sleep when the sound of Dean’s breath hitching in his chest catches his ear.  Cas’s eyes open again.  The muscles of Dean’s face have gone taut, frown lines deepening and jaw clenching.  His hand twitches into a fist where it lays on the sheet between them.  Cas can hear his teeth grinding, and another breath shudders out of him.
