There was a beat of silence as Cas shook on the spot.
“Yeah sure.” Sam smiled, but he looked at Cas with concern. It worried him that Cas and Dean wouldn’t be seeing each other for so long. The two were utterly inseparable usually. “Take it easy ok. You look like hell.” Sam smiled, but his eyes betrayed his alarm.
Cas shouldn’t have let himself sleep so long. Turns out getting 8 hours sleep in one night, when you’ve only had double that per week is a massive shock to the system. It took every ounce of will power he had to drag himself out of bed, he’d felt far, far less tired before.
“I never would Sam. He’s going to be ok, I think… it’s a long road but…”
“Thank you.” He accepted.
“I’d crawl in a hole and die.” Gabriel finished bluntly.
“Dean…”
“Are you ok?” Dean asked frantically. “Did I hurt you, what did I…”
“No, its not.” Dean agreed with a chuckle. “But we need to promise each other something else.”
“Don’t. Tell. Dean.” Castiel said firmly, his eyes dark and dangerous.
“Besides we both know you don’t do chick flick moments.” Cas smiled.
Cas was working 12 hours shifts from 6am on weekdays, he loved his job, but it was mentally exhausting. He got home and cooked a meal for Dean, who came home later with every passing day, trying to keep on top of the work. He always put on a smile, despite his own tiredness. Cas then made lunch for them both for the next day and packed it in the fridge. He stayed sat up in bed, doing the accounts in the dark so it was ready for Dean in the morning. He was after all, good with numbers.
“But I can’t promise you that I will get better. Nothing is certain even at this stage, but the doctors, they are now optimistic.” Cas put his hand in Dean’s as his husband moved his chair closer to the bed. “I have kidney failure Dean, probably for months before the Cancer started.”
“I’m going to go stand by the road, the ambulance will be here any second.” Sam said, the sound of branches breaking announcing his departure.
“I can drop down to normal hours now.”
“I haven’t even seen him for months. He’s so busy with work. I doubt he’ll even notice I’m gone.”
“That is hardly practical.” Cas scoffed. “And medically impossible.”
“Miss Talbot. It’s Gabriel, please.”
“I’ll go get the doc.” Balthazar said as Cas focused on his brothers face.
“Let me finish please. The fact that you ever thought I could have cheated on you, it hurts me Dean. You are my absolute world and I thought you knew me better than that. You’re right I didn’t want to see you, even after Gabriel told me this might all be some huge misunderstanding, but I… Gabriel was right. I thought if I heard it from you, that you had cheated on me, I wouldn’t be able to cope, but the not knowing is hurting me far more. I want to hear your side Dean, but before you start I need you to know that I can’t take you lying to me. I need the truth Dean, all of it, and if you did… If there was someone else then…” Cas sighed. “Then maybe there’s still a way we could go forward.”
“Not the garage Cas, you said it, that doesn’t matter. I meant us. I lost you and I can’t live without you Cas, I need to know if there is a way we can fix us.”
“Right here baby brother.” Gabriel answered, sitting on the other side bed and putting a hand on his little brother’s shoulder. “And I’m not going anywhere.”
“I want to put this behind us Dean. We don’t need to renew our vows because neither of us broke them. We made mistakes, they’re in the past. I love you Dean and if there’s one thing this past year has taught me is that time is precious. Let’s not waste a second.”
Bearing in mind I want to keep it open for a potential sequel what do you want to see in the final chapter?
“I believed you no longer cared for me, that Gabriel would despise me for what I allowed them to do to me…”
Gabriel’s phone started ringing and he checked the caller ID. “I have to take this.” Gabriel moved away a little. “Bella?”
“Cassie, I’m your big brother. I can tell when something’s wrong.” He examined the bruises on Castiel’s arms and the cut on his head. “Is he hurting you?” He glowered.
“I tried to keep him calm, to help him but after a while… he just shut down.”
“I’m not lying!” Dean protested angrily.
“Dean, he practically told you he’d cheated on you, what were you supposed to do, read his mind?”
“Sam Winchester, what could you possibly want?”
“I know Cas, but well, I couldn’t help noticing you didn’t eat a lot…”
“Eileen.” Sam warned, he usually oved his fiancé’s no-nonsense approach, but Cas was prone to shutting down when he felt threatened. “Cas, come on, we’re your family you can talk to us.”
“We’re all his family Gabriel. Its not just on you, its on all of us. And there’s nothing you could have done to stop it. He’s here with us now and he’s safe. We can’t change the past.”
“We’re going to need more booze!”
………………………..
“Dean, what’s mine is yours. You’re my husband, you don’t owe me anything.”
“Then you got me Cas, you’ve always got me.”
“Cas, the only place I’m taking you is the hospital.” Jody said gently.
It was only a few short steps into the room, but Dean ran them. He didn’t like what he saw.
“Yeah, sure that’s a great idea.” Dean nodded. Pam, Pamela Barnes, was an old friend of the family, that family being Ellen and Bobby’s… but they hadn’t seen her in years and Cas had never met her. She was a psychiatrist and a therapist, and a damn good one at that.
“Gabriel has hired Bella Talbot as Cas’ lawyer.”
“It’s... Dean’s filed for divorce. He’s divorcing me.”
Cas looked over the spreadsheet again. He and Dean had agreed on the accountant’s salary, but looking at the books, the accountant was being payed $200 a month more than he’d suggested to Dean.
“Ok.” Gabriel didn’t argue further. Now wasn’t the time. He just held his brother tightly and tried not to let the tears flow down his cheeks.
“Hey!”
“I’m sure he’s fine, just working some crazy shifts, like me. Keeping on top of this mortgage sucks.”
“He’s staying with me for a few days. I’ll give it to him.” he beckoned Sam to hand it over.
“Thank God, your last call I was so worried…”
“Oh Cas, you have to stop this. Where are you? You should be resting.”
“Yeah, sssorry just…”
“Ok…” Sam frowned. “I thought Cas was on DOD training this weekend?” He asked.
“Control this is Sherriff Mills.” She said picking up the radio and glancing at Cas in the back seat. He was out cold already which wasn’t a surprise, but it also wasn’t a good sign. This would be a great opportunity to drive him to the hospital regardless of his wishes, but she knew Cas and he was stubborn. If she did that they risked him denying it ever happened and not pressing charges.
“What…”
Dean probably didn’t even want to marry him. He’d been self-absorbed to think so. Dean had probably just proposed to make Cas happy. Dean did things like that a lot, putting others before himself. He didn’t think he mattered, no matter how hard Cas had tried to change that.
“Hey Cas, how you been?” Sam smiled, but the look faded as he took in Castiel.
“We really need to work on our communication.” Dean huffed and Cas chuckled lightly. “I’ll try a lot harder to listen and not jump to conclusions and you’re going to try to express yourself better and not predetermine what I’m going to think or feel. We both need to talk about our feelings a lot more, Capisce?”
“I’m not going anywhere angel.” He promised. And he meant it. He was never going anywhere again.
“It wasn’t your fault.” Dean said. “You need to say it Cas.”
“I’ll be fine Gabriel. As the doctor said, its 2 months then I’ll have the rest of my life… or what’s left of it anyway.” Cas hung his head sadly.
“Argument with my fiancée.” Cas admitted downing his drink in one. Another one replaced it so quickly he barely noticed.
“I… I can’t promise you that Dean, not yet.” Cas said sadly.
“We could do it on Monday night.” Cas offered, but it was too late.
“Yeah, well I’m always funny. That’s my talent.”
“Oh Cas Honey…” Jody started, but as she got closer to her friend she realised something was off. Jody frowned. Yes, Cas smelt of alcohol but looking at his eyes, the usual blue was engulfed but the black of his blown pupils and the way he could not focus on her made her stomach dropped.
“Yes, you will I’m afraid, in fact, it would be best to keep you in from this point. You will need a week or two to recover from the surgery before we start chemo, so until the kidney failure is reversed dialysis will be essential.”
“Yes, I would. We made our vows Gabe, on our Wedding day. Even if he hasn’t honoured them, I will.”
“I’m not going to think Castiel is dead Dean, I can’t.”
Dean stood there, seemingly in shock for a moment. “You mean that?” He said nervously.
“Ok Cassie. That’s fine.” Gabriel accepted that as the best he was going to get for now.
“You idiot Cas. You absolute damn idiot.” Here it was Cas thought, but then he realised Dean was crying. Why was Dean crying?
“There is an old friend of the family, Pam, Pamela Barnes, you may have heard us talk about her?”
“What is it? Is she a problem.”
…………………………………………..
“I’m sorry Cassie. How are you feeling?”
“Yes Dean, Pie’s already in the bag.”
“Sammy, can you get the paperwork?”
“You tried to kill yourself before… you never told me.” Dean sounded heartbroken.
“What do you mean?” Cas asked in confusion.
“Forgive you?” He said sternly. Cas shivered, and Dean huffed shaking his head. “Was I not good enough Cas?” He said coldly. “Was I not understanding and sympathetic and endlessly patient?”
“Gabe, how are you holding up?”
“Both kidneys are affected, but only the one severely. If we can stop it spreading, remove the bad kidney and treat the other, with your age and general health there is a very good chance we will be able to both eradicate the cancer in the good kidney and get it to recover with the correct treatment. There is also the option for transplant if necessary. All in all, there is a very real chance you will be able to live a normal life.”
“Dean…” Gabriel’s face sent a surging feeling of worry and nausea into the pit of Dean’s stomach. “He really needs you.”
“What?” Sam said in shock.
“We got an endorsement, so money should be fine. You can quit at the gas station… And I thought, maybe we could go out for diner this weekend.” Dean probed, praying he wasn’t going to get the response he thought he was about to.
, Cas, for giving me a second chance.”
Shit… “Did they hurt your back?” She said worriedly. She of course knew of Cas’s injury and she was terrified that after all he’d been through to get back on his feet that he would be left paraplegic by this.
“Oh Cas. I’m sorry, I know you love him but he’s a dick and you deserve so much better.”
Cas’ eyebrows raised in alarm. “And now what?” He said challengingly. “Dean if this is because you think you are not worth it…”
“Sam and Dean… Winchester?” The cashier asked tentatively.
“Of course, Gabriel.”
“I think Cassie’s summary proved it really wasn’t that complicated and certainly did not require such a long-winded explanation!”
“Cas, I….”
“Dean, go wait in the car.”
… I don’t know exactly what’s going on, but I understand you now know that your belief I was cheating on you was misplaced.”
He started walking to his bedroom when a sudden wave of Nausea hit him. Half an hour later he glanced at his phone while he spewed his guts into the toilet basin. Email from his boss. He’d be taking the boss’ weekend shifts… Saturday 5-9pm and Sunday 4am-4pm. He looked at the time. Great. Looks like he was working in 40 minutes.
“Put your oxygen back in please.” And then jerked himself, realising how much like their mother he sounded.
“And underfloor heating?”
“Well…” Cas said, the shrug sounded in his voice.
“Mr. Novak, what seems to be the problem?”
“Oh no, please tell me this wasn’t last night.”
“I’ll talk to the doctor soon, but I… if its ok, I’d like you to talk to Jody. You need to decide what you want to do about… what happened.”
Cas looked at him with a frown and then started to feel very weird. He felt tired. So very tired all of a sudden. His head started spinning. Shit, he wasn’t supposed to have his painkillers with alcohol… had he had any today? He didn’t usually take them, but today he’d been struggling. He couldn’t remember if he’d taken any… As a matter of fact he was having a hard time remembering anything at all. His head felt fuzzy and disconnected. Something was wrong.
……………………………
“I know its hard Cas, I can’t imagine what this is like for you and I’m not trying to put you under any pressure, but I just want you to understand that this is time critical. And its horrible to think about, but you do need to get tested in case any of them…”
“Oh God, I’m such an idiot.” Dean put his face in his hands.
“I feel better.” As smiled back. Was something really going right for a change?
“You’re hiring smack heads that’s what.”
……………………………………
“What?” Eileen asked concerned.
“Hold me, please?” He asked, as if he were afraid of being rejected. Dean didn’t need any further invitation. He squeezed onto the edge of the tiny hospital bed and gently wrapped himself around Castiel. Now he could feel that his Angel was trembling. A hand fisted into his shirt, but Cas’ eyes were still glassy.
Any sequel would go more into the recovery and working up to them getting married.
……………….
“I’m sorry to jump you like this, I think our brother’s kind of set it up. I wouldn’t have come if I’d had known they’d not told you I was coming.” Dean sighed. “I’ll go if you want me to.”
“It is.” Cas sobbed. “And even if it isn’t I am filthy and ruined and wrong and you could never want me now.” He ranted hysterically.
Sam frowned in worry, remembering they’re earlier encounter at the flat and the encounter with Dean. Dean was usually the one looking after Cas, making sure that the overly selfless guy wasn’t neglecting himself, but if Dean wasn’t around as much Cas was likely putting himself last all the time.
“No, I promise I didn’t want it, Dean, I didn’t want them to, I didn’t want it…” Cas sobbed and gripped fiercely into Dean’s coat.
“Dean I love you more than I am capable of describing. I always felt like
“You blame yourself I know you do." Cas continued. "And I know you’re angry and upset and tired because I keep waking you up in the night...”
…………………………
“Eughhh.” Was all Cas could offer at this stage.
“You wouldn’t be wrong.” Cas sighed.
Cas looked up weakly to stare into a kind and worried face that was very familiar, but too blurry to make out.
“Ok.”
Dean crumpled up the letter and through it at the wall with force.
It was a miracle they’d been able to buy the business. Poor Bobby Singer had been desperate to sell. He was suffering from heart disease and wanted to spend his last years living life to the full. He was a great Boss and Cas knew Dean considered him a friend. That’s why when Dean came up with the crackpot idea of taking over Bobby had cancelled the deal with the developers and reduced the price as much as he could.
“Thank you, Dean. I’ll… I’ll give it a try. You can show her in.”
“That’s great.” Cas smiled weakly, there was genuine happiness in his eyes. “I’ve missed you.” He said, but he didn’t move any closer. There was no intimacy between them, in fact despite his happiness at the news Cas looked a little hostile, like he was deliberately avoiding Dean.
Slowly but surely the realisation hit. Cas had been drugged and dragged out the bar into the alley, his clothes were dishevelled, and his belt wasn’t properly done like he’d tried to put things right but hadn’t been able to. Cas had been raped.
“Why?” He repeated.
“Castiel?”
“What aren’t you telling me Cassie?”
“Have you lined up what you want from this settlement Mr. Winchester?”
“Why?” Cas asked with a frown.
“Get in the car!” Dean demanded, marching towards his beloved impala.
Cas had scraped up half a million, by raiding his inheritance from his mad uncle, scraping together his savings and asking Gabriel, the only person in his family he still talked to for a favour. They’d had to borrow 7 million in the end.
His stomach ached. But he felt… better somehow. That feeling of sickness, the unbearable and constant nausea was gone, well, not gone, but it was like a weight had been lifted. He wearily forced his eyes to open, fighting against the cloud of sleep.
“I know, I know.” He huffed.
Sam fell silent for a minute. He realised he’d switched sides in this whole thing with a snap of his fingers. Only weeks ago, he was tearing his brother a new one for neglecting Cas and here he’d been defending Dean, neglecting Cas,
“Gabe, go take a breather he’ll be in surgery for a few more hours yet. There’s nothing you can do here. I’ll call you if anything happens… which means I won’t be calling you, because everything is going to be fine.”
“The one that was 2 sizes too small, but he insisted on keeping?”
Cas knew the fact that he was the high earner and the one paying for Dean’s dream made his husband feel insecure. Dean was very much the stereotype of manly, it had taken him so long to admit he was Bi Cas had almost given up waiting. He would be forever grateful that he hadn’t.
it calls.
Claire grinned at him evilly for a moment before his phone pinged. “Eileen?” she asked, leaning over to read his screen sideways.
“— and this is the one to get him out?”
“D’you think it will work?” Sam says in the most gentle voice he’s possibly ever used with Dean — and he’s been so painfully delicate with him for the past few months.
It’s been a while since Dean wore a trench coat — not since he tried one on as a joke in a thrift store in Philly, much to the amusement of Sam — so the feel of wearing it is unfamiliar, but it’s oddly comforting, too. There’s a ghost of warmth along the sleeves that he can’t quite tell is the product of wishful thinking or not, but it’s nice to imagine that it’s the remnants of Cas’ body heat, as much as that exists for an angel in a human vessel.
He bites his lip — hard.
He shifts on the park bench again. Sam is only fifteen minutes away on his supply run, by Dean’s best guess. Just a little longer, he tells himself, just a little longer before he can be nice and warm in the Impala, heater and music both blasting.
“Go on your date.”
“She agrees with me?” Claire assumed aloud.
“Claire.”
b. Abandonment
“Yes, you do.” Claire checked her pockets, realised she hadn’t cuffed her jeans, and stooped to do just that.
2. Write a personal essay on the prompt "what does sacrifice mean?"
Sam tilted his screen away. “Remind me what you’re getting ready for right now?” he said, gaze intently focused on his screen but tone laced with amusement.
He should.
But Cas just shrugs out of his trench coat, gathers it up, and holds it out towards Dean.
“You have sounds on?” Claire asked,
How can’t he remember?
Castiel approaches slowly, feeling out the weight of having a vessel once more. The man looks like a frightened animal, trembling in the grass. Slowly, he rises.
I am not there; I did not die.
Dean blinks and lets the words filter through the haze of his mind which had been hovering somewhere adjacent to unconsciousness. “Huh?”
b. Something otherworldly, but not holy + a void of emotion
Dean grinds his jaw, and looks down to the table. He pushes the book away.
Dean grits his teeth together, preparing for the verbal onslaught.
too much to hold any sort of hope.
“What? I’m an adult. I can take care of myself.”
Dean rolls his eyes, but gratitude blooms warm in his chest when he slips the coat on.
The most true love.
He can’t remember a name.
“Date with Kaia.”
He follows Cas’ gaze, trying not to swerve off the road in the meantime, and quickly notices the tiny flakes of snow that are falling, that catch in the Impala’s slipstream and swirl in eddies — some plastering against the window, some vanishing into the air.
Claire rolled her eyes, mostly to herself, at the muted stream of voices coming from the next library wing over. “They are
“I don’t do puppy dog eyes,” Sam said firmly, putting his phone down.
He walks around the side to sit next to Dean. When he shuffles back, his trench coat bunches up under him, and he stands again to readjust it with the expression of someone who had their coffee too long ago to deal with this. Fondness swells in Dean’s chest when Cas smiles in satisfaction once he’s wrangled his coat into an acceptable position behind him.
d. Tears
It feels like longer.
Absentmindedly, he brings a hand to his left shoulder, fiddles with the fabric under which there used to be a handprint. A mark — the only one he’s ever found pleasure in bearing. The wind brings the warm taste of the approaching summer when Dean breathes it in. He’s trying to heal. He’s trying, but he’s missing something.
When you awaken in the morning’s hush
But Cas straightens anyway. The falling turns to sinking.
He lets it wash over him, lets Dean cling to his shirt, lets himself remember every smile and every significant look and every long drive and every late–night diner stop. “Dean,” he says again — and he’s home.
And the fog clears.
It’s been a few months, now. Three.
Castiel gets a good look at his face, contorted with grief and confusion and longing — green eyes. Green eyes — green like the forest, green like new growth, green like soft grass and stained glass.
He misses a home he does not know.
Unaware of the distress jackrabbiting in Dean’s chest, Cas simply tilts his head and asks, “Are you still cold?”
If he had a physical form to feel it, he might shiver. On some incorporeal level, he does — several pairs of wings and several thousand eyes shudder, stumble, but there is nobody to see it.
He hopes it was important.
Warmth swells up Dean’s cheeks, painting them rosy in the dim light of the evening, and Dean is grateful that Cas can’t see his face. If he smiles a little after he can’t fight it anymore, well, nobody can see him. It’s just him and Cas and the snow, slowly falling through the air. If he tilts his head into Cas, and winds an arm around his back, nobody would know.
“Geezer.”
Sam ignored the jab. “And how are you getting to this date with Kaia, exactly?”
a. Loss
it says. He cannot
“I don’t do puppy dog eyes.”
Sam sighed good–naturedly, sorting through sheafs of tightly type–set documents. “They’re
For a moment, Dean can’t feel his body — in the moment between his heartbeats, he loses all sensation except for a sense of falling, falling in his stomach; of hurtling through the air at colossal speeds, but just for a split second. Just for a moment.
“Nope.” Claire pulled her socks up — the mushroom pattern was disappearing as they rolled down. Kaia loved the mushroom socks. “You guys don’t parade it everywhere. And at least I haven’t spent years dealing with your puppy dog eyes.”
A way to get Cas back.
Still. Still.
Dean traces the lines of Cas’ profile with his eyes appreciatively — the guy isn’t half bad–looking, all soft brows and stubbly lips, hair curling at his temples and the blue in his irises muted in the wooded shade. There’s a slight tension in his brow, a little tangle of thought creasing his eyes, and Dean wants to smooth his hands over it, run fingers down his cheeks and follow the line of his jaw, but he can’t. As much as he wants to so desperately, Dean can’t touch him.
The trees are heavy with wilting leaves the colour of flames. At a glance, one might assume — and forgivably so — that the woods are on fire. Wind rushes through the canopy, setting the boughs aquiver, the sound like the crackling of fire.
“But if you don’t tell me your name, how will I ask you out on a date?” Cas asked, nervously.
“I love you” he blurted out. He was shocked that it came to him so easily. He had only said that to three people in his life: his mother, his brother and his adoptive father, Bobby.
“Yeah, I was new at the time and they just let me use Steve’s tag. He left like a couple days before I started, and they hadn’t had a chance to make me one. Company policy requires me to wear a name tag, even if it isn’t my own name.”
Steve frowned at the comment. “Oh, I’m sorry to hear that. If you’d like, I can recommend a different pizza.”
He returned with his own little box, a slim gold band resting in a cushion of red velvet.
Sam paled and swiftly grabbed his rucksack, pushing Dean out the door.
Tomorrow I’ll be gone. Hopefully, I’ll be gone before you wake. I can’t imagine saying goodbye to you, not knowing if I’ll ever say hello again. All I can say is look after yourself. Stay alive, please. And if I never say it to you again… Cas, I love you with all my heart, all my soul. I will fight til the ends of the earth for you, I will go to hell and suffer for you, I will trade my life for you. You will forever and always be my one and only love. Never forget that. Never doubt that.
Sammy,
Dean’s mind spun... Did Cas think it was a real date? Did Dean want it to be?
Disappointed, Dean turned and left, swinging the chips in his hand.
Normally Dean’s hackles would raise when people offered sympathy at his and Sammy’s situation. But for some reason, Cas’ reply sent a tendril of warmth through his chest.
“At least nobody else died”, Jack responded in kind.
I’ve also been looped into teaching a beginner’s baking class. I’m not really sure how it happened, but I have a feeling Sam roped Ellen into pulling some strings. I keep seeing familiar faces at the community college. Charlie signed up for my class, she is a disaster in the kitchen, and Benny comes to eat with me if I have an afternoon class.
Cas flushed. “Wow. Even your name is hot.”
He tugged on Cas’ sleeve to try and pull him away from the center of the ever growing crowd, but Cas was too engrossed. Sighing, Dean followed him into the mass of students. To his dismay, the crowd parted like water. He could hear whispers and he knew that people were expecting a fight.
Dean smiled back, “thank you so much. Sam will love this.”
He was so tired that he didn’t notice the smile the clerk gave him. He walked straight to the chilled aisle and grabbed the first vegetarian meal he could find. This would have to tie Sam over until Dean could find the energy to properly buy some groceries.
“That one is vegetarian. I really like it. It’s cheese, tomatoes, peppers and spinach.” The man tapped the box and smiled.
“Don’t worry, I’m sure I’m more of a mess than you are. You’re just catching me on a good day.”
Dean opened the wallet cradling it close to him to find it void of any cash and card, but in the front pocket there was an old crumpled photo of Dean that he didn’t even know Cas had and another pristine passport size photo of Dean hugging Cas at the finish of the Chicago marathon where he’d run 2:08 and come 5th. Cas had broken down in tears on the finish line, he couldn’t believe the time and Dean had sobbed along with him, but that had definitely been due to his hay fever. At that moment, Cas’ dream of getting Olympic selection had been very, very real, but that had also been his last race before he accident.
“I thought you were taking time off?”
“Yes, pack a bag we’re going now.”
Sam sighed. “Cas, it’s nothing like that, I’m just worried about you and about Dean.”
“You both know that remission is remission, it is no guarantee, but your remission 6 months ago was partial, this time I’m deeming it complete remission. There is no sign of your cancer have disappeared.”
…………………………………….
“Morning Cas.” Dean said softly, moving back a little to give him some space. Sam sat up straight in his chair and Gabriel hurried round to the other side of the bed.
“I do Cas. I need to make sure you are looking after yourself. So, I’ll pick you up at 9am.”
“Well then it sounds very much like a genetic causation. Because it is such a late stage I have referred you to a specialist, they suggest you start chemotherapy almost immediately. We have a space at a clinic in Atlanta next weekend which I would very strongly suggest you take up. Time is of the essence and they will be able assess whether surgery will help.”
“It’s ok, I’m just… I don’t want to think about those things again, not today, I just want to go home.”
“We are not sure what could have caused it in someone so young. You don’t drink or smoke? Do drugs.”
…………………………...
“He’s not here?” Sam said worriedly.
“Homeless shelters?” Sam offered, more optimistically.
“And you better make up the spare room, because I’m staying few weeks.” Gabriel announced.
“How did you know that?” Dean asked with a frown. The Sherriff had only just called him, so how could Sam already know? Cas didn’t even know yet.
Dean was starting to think this whole thing was a bad idea. It was nothing like he’d dreamed. Nothing like he’d wanted. He was stuck in an office, all day every day. At the start at least, he’d had a few hours with Cas on an evening, but then he hadn’t been able to stay up. Dean got that at first. Cas was worn out, of course he was… but after a while the loneliness and longing for his husband’s company wore off and was just replaced with misery and tiredness.
………………………………………………………..
“Yeah of course.” Dean looked up briefly and then started writing again.
……………………
Cas was silent for a long time, solemn and eyes downcast and Dean worried at his bottom lip hoping he hadn’t crossed a line.
Dean point blank refused to leave once visiting hours where over. Cas was comfily curled into him, holding him in a vice like grip even though he’d finally fallen into a drug induced sleep. And Dean was sure as hell not going to disturb him. In fact, none of them ended up leaving, Jody had, had to step in to prevent things getting confrontational, but Sam Gabe and Dean had all spent the night in Cas’ room. It had been largely uneventful apart from the time when a nurse had come in and tried to top up Cas’ sedative, which nearly resulted in Gabriel biting the hand of said nurse off before Sam had held him back.
Jess had, had to go to work. Sam had taken the day off to stay with Dean and Jess had wanted to do the same, but he’d convinced her he’d be alright. He wasn’t sure he would though, how was he supposed to help Dean?
“Yeah, he’s been doing better because of Dean and It wouldn’t be the first time he’s tried to...” Gabriel grunted bitterly, stopping himself
“You know what,” Dean took Cas by the shoulders. “Husband.” He breathed, emphasising the word. Jade eyes locked with bright blue orbs and Dean took a breath, savouring every inch of his partners face. “When we have enough money to buy a house, I will
“Cas…” Dean protested. “You are in pain every day, you can’t say you don’t wish it would go away.”
“The pair of them are just the biggest idiots I have ever met. Long story short he wasn’t cheating either, just being a colossal moron.”
“I don’t care whether you are asking, I am doing.”
“I’m fine Jody.” Cas sighed sadly.
“It’s only a few hours, early morning. Besides we really need the money.”
“Cas…”
“Ok Cas, I promise I’ll try, I really will. And I aint every leaving you alone again.”
“Hi Dean, I’m sorry if this a bad time I was just calling to ask how Cas is coping.”
“Cas. Cas is gone.”
Dean blinked. He’d never met someone as open as Cas. He must have been staring for too long because Cas squared his shoulders, a crease forming between his eyebrows.
“When you exploded in the empty, you didn’t die because the empty wasn’t as powerful as God. You did, however, absorb some of it. Now the empty is much older than God, almost as old as death. So, it sort of boosted your power. Made you an ancient being. Your split heritage made you more powerful than God. Part human, part archangel, part God destroyer and part empty. And that is why you are more than enough to fill God’s role.”
“Stealing Dean’s car.”
Then — it stops.
Four months since Cas left. Three since he celebrated Christmas without him. Two since a lonely New Year’s. One since the spell.
They’re set up in an abandoned farmhouse, because of something–something; it’s a better location for the exact magic they want to perform. Dean only remembers because Sam explained maybe a dozen times on the drive over, but even for all the logical reasons, Dean can’t help but remember how he first met Cas while he’s spray painting sigils onto packed earth.
“Yeah, and?” Claire grabbed her Docs from where she’d dropped them next to the table legs and pulled them on, lacing them tightly. “Still gross.”
Cas blinks once, slowly, then moves across the length of the bench to sit right next to Dean, and, as if Dean isn’t already dead enough from the warm line of contact along where their thighs are pressed together, puts an arm around him.
He closes his eyes and lets sleep wash over him.
I am the soft stars that shine at night.
Sam wrestled his phone away from her. “Yes, I do.”
He cries anyway.
The other door opens and shuts. Cas straightens up on the other side of the car. “Why did you pull over?”
Sam tilted the screen away again, and was very silent.
“Yeah, of course. But they’re so… gross.”
“I miss you,” he says, aloud. The empty field, misty with the blue early morning, is silent. “Cas,” he adds, and that’s the first time he’s said that name for months, and —
, Claire.”
“Uh–huh,” Sam said, drawing out the second syllable.
3. What is the chemical foundation for an angel’s eyes glowing?
He picks two — they’re dandelions, he thinks — and rolls the stems between his fingers.
Sonnet 73, William Shakespeare
“It’s fine, Dean.” Cas’ voice is as forgiving as always. “And no, I haven’t.”
Or, perhaps, was it a true attempt at rescue? Does someone miss him? Does someone want him back — for ulterior motives? As a pawn? Or perhaps somebody wanted to return him home.
“I found something,” Sam says, thudding a book down on the table. It’s red, decorated with stripes of what probably used to be gold turned brown with age.
Dean purses his lips somewhat awkwardly, not sure what to do, but Cas nods minutely and resumes his earlier position.
Unbidden, a tiny bit of hope sets root.
2. A man — is it the same man as before? — feels an unidentifiable amount of love: a compound of desperation, friendship, and loneliness
“Dude, you sound just like him.” Claire put on a husky voice. “‘Don’t scratch Baby! If you do I will
“…So you’re happy that they reached it?” Sam said tentatively, setting down his papers to look at Claire.
They go through several tins of spray paint before they’re done. Dean fusses with the edges to make sure they’re precise. Against his better judgement, he thinks it might work.
A way to get Cas back.
1. A man sits on the floor of an empty room. The door is open, and two people that have walked inside today will not walk out. There are no vents, windows, or other exits. There are no loopholes, spells or ways to change what has occurred, however much you want to. What happened? How well can you pretend it didn’t?
The snow drifts down calmly, dusting the blacktop, obscuring the lanes and blurring the edge of the road and the grass. The sun is setting now, and the light catches in the snowflakes and the clouds — pink on the horizon and the distant grass, yellow trailing up into the sky and silhouetting the skeletons of trees that stand tall and lonely, blue in the shadows of the road and the Impala and the folds of Cas’ coat.
When he comes back to himself, Cas is still leaning against him, so solid that it surely isn’t a dream, and he can barely breathe for it. Even the tiniest huff of breath, cloudy in the still air of winter, could disrupt the moment and send ripples across the water’s surface until Castiel sits up straight again, and his touch is just a quickly fading memory.
How can’t he remember?
Dean worries his lip between his teeth for a moment, thinking, then pulls the car to a slow, then a halt, just off the road. He flicks the radio off and switches gears so that the car is parked, the engine purring lowly underneath them.
“Yeah.” Claire picked up her jacket — the black leather one that Eileen had given her as a birthday gift. The inside was lined with something comfortably soft. Cotton, maybe.
affronted, swooping down to turn them off.
The person he sacrificed himself for.
This is the way the world ends: not with a bang, but with a whimper.
I am the swift uplifting rush
Dean grunts, “don’t mention it,” but he can feel a flush working its way up his cheeks.
Cas obliges, and Dean clicks his tongue in thanks. “C’mon,” he says, and he opens the door.
She stood, and did a few test stomps that made Sam wince before he said, “…Puppy dog eyes?”
He can’t even recall home.
What he feels for Cas — that’s the most true thing he’s ever felt. Through water, through fire, Cas has always been there. Even if they hate each other. Even if they can’t remember each other — he always finds his way back to Cas.
“What?” Dean says, eyes flicking between Cas’ hands and his face, which, frustratingly, does not betray any emotion.
Dean is insistent — he double and triple checks the documents Sam compiled, the books they hunched over to find answers. Sam’s Latin is perfect, the sigils are exact, everything is as it should be, except there are only two people in the barn where there should be a third. There’s no rush of wings, no flash of magic, no rolling thunder.
Cas is sitting on the other end of the bench, hunched over, hands clasped in his lap. He’s been staring at the tree a few yards away for the past five minutes, unmoving, eyes fixed on a knot in the wood.
“What are you —” Cas begins to say, but Dean cuts him off.
c. A family
He taps along on the wheel, eyes fixed steadily on the open stretch of road in front of him. Evening is coming all too soon, rushed in by the wintertime. The sky has drifted into a dull gray, the clouds indistinguishable from the empty space in the dying light.
It’s a welcome relief, but even for that, Dean stutters over his, “Yeah — a bit — I guess —”
d. Even more Heavenly plan bullshit
“Cas!” he says, lowly, brokenly, and Castiel remembers his name.
“Dean,” Castiel chokes, and he remembers it all.
“‘Through only the most... the most — true love,’” he stammers, “‘can a soul be saved from eternal damnation to the void.’”
“A spell. I think if we tweak it a bit, it might work.” Sam sits down opposite Dean — they’re in the library — and begins turning the ancient pages with gentle hands. God.
For a time, he wonders.
Do not stand at my grave and cry,
He remembers … he remembers green eyes. He remembers being lost in them.
Dean half envies him. Envies how easily he moves on.
It doesn’t work.
“Why are you uh–huh’ing me?” Claire said, mocking affront.
And when they eventually tumble back into the Impala, if he lingers a little longer at the passenger side than he needs, if he leans down and presses a quick, nervous kiss to Castiel’s temple, well, that’s just between them and the beautiful, empty miles of snow.
Do not stand at my grave and weep
“You ain’t seen the snow much, huh?” Dean says, making Cas flinch. “Sorry,” he winces.
When Dean finally works up the courage to look at Cas straight on, he sees a little furrow in his brow that quickly smooths over into a tiny smile when they make eye contact.
It is added to a solution of undeserved love, composed of sadness, respect and need. What happens? (What happened?)
b. An early grave
b. Fate + dumb luck
“…Fine. Just don’t scratch it.”
“No, but its true. Help yourself and you’ll be able to help your husband better.”
It took a while for the phone to ring and it wasn’t the response he was hoping for.
“Jody it’s not your fault.” Sam sighed. “We all know what Cas is like…”
“Castiel, don’t you worry about that for a second. You have insurance and I will pay for the rest.”
“You’re saying I could lose the garage.”
“Let’s get you to bed. Big day tomorrow.”
Cas stepped into the doctor’s office.
“Not a problem.” She smiled.
“What you say about me being your light… when I rejected you, when I thought you’d had an affair and I told you to leave, what you did Cas… you wouldn’t have done that if you were 100% sane, if you were 100% ok. You could have gone to Charlie’s… anywhere but you just went to you're favourite place and lay down in the open, knowing how cold it would get at night. It was like, like you wanted to die. Did you?” Dean's voice cracked, his eyes dangerously full.
“Ok Cas, I’ll take you home.” Jody sighed.
“Thank you, Dean.”
“Good news?” Sam asked Dean with a knowing smile as Dean hung up the phone.
“Nothing, I’ll tell him I’m DOD training this weekend and well, there is training but it’s for field agents not techies.”
It had been two weeks since Dean had proposed to him. Two weeks since he’d got in the Impala with his boyfriend and asked where they were going, to be told that it was a surprise. And it had been quite a surprise.
“Yeah, no I get it that’s ok… Dean explained things to me.”
It had been a long 12months, 3 of which he’d spent in the hospital. Since the day Dean had found him in the hospital it hadn’t been straight back to normal. Neither of them could forget what had happened, yes, it had been one huge misunderstanding, but the boat had been shaken and things like that don’t mend overnight.
“He really wowed at interview and well, he’s a really nice guy. But he wanted a higher salary, Grandmother’s in hospital, cancer, so I thought it wasn’t a lot different.”
Jody frowned, she really didn’t want to leave but, at this stage, she might as well go all in. “Ok call me if you need me and don’t be a stranger.”
There was no reply but 20minutes later there was an email on his laptop. The brightness of the screen burned his eyes as he tried to make sense of what was in front of him, but he couldn’t. The whole system was so disorganised and haphazard he couldn’t figure out what was coming or going.
“Cas and I broke up Jody, he cheated on me.”
“Sam, I need a lawyer.”
But half an hour later they were still driving, and it was dark outside. “Dean…”
Cas was desperate to get home to bed. It was 11:30 and he was up 3:30 for work. But Sam obviously needed something, his face was sincere and laced with concern and he never let his friend down.
“Cas is cheating… that’s rich. We both know Dean’s the one cheating.”
“Cas he’ll understand.”
“You fine on the tills if I start inventory?”
(See the end of the chapter for
“Hey Cas!” Eileen smiled as she opened the door, taking the bottle of wine from him and looking around curiously. “Dean not with you?” She asked. “He better not be hiding again to make me jump.” Cas shook his head and signed back
“Ok, I’m sorry, just two seconds. Everything’s fine.” Cas said and then put the phone back to his ear.
“Oh shit.” Was the last thing Cas managed to breathe out before he completely lost control of his body. He felt himself grabbed by several strong pairs of hands and pulled outside into the alley. He wanted to fight, but he couldn’t, he tried to beg and plead and cry, but he couldn’t do that either.
“Me and Jess are having dinner with some friends Dean, I can’t just…”
Very short chapter I know, but I'm trying to do shorter chapters for this fic rather than 10,000+ extravaganzas like I'm used to.
“Gabriel came into town, so I have been staying with him. It’s fine Sam he’s looking after me.”
Cas had walked as far as his legs would carry him and then a little further still. Dean hated him. His brother and his friends would too. By now they would all know of his disgusting and vile behaviour. They would all hate him and even if they didn’t, he had no right to their forgiveness, no right to be in their lives. Most like likely, they wouldn’t want him there anyway.
“Dean?” Cas didn’t know what to think, what to feel. Half of him was overjoyed that Dean was here, the other half felt betrayed and scared and… then he looked at Dean’s face. The man was sat a few feet away from the bed in a chair, only half facing Cas. His posture was dejected, almost… ashamed and his eyes were red. Had Dean been crying? Why had Dean been crying? He hated to see Dean crying.
“No.” Cas sighed. “I’m worried about what will happen if it goes to trial, I’m worried about having to testify… I don’t think I could do that Sam, I don’t think I could go through that.” Cas' composure tailed off rapidly as he spoke, so much so that Sam feared he might have a panic attack.
“Yeah Gabriel I did. How’s Cas?”
They sat in silence for a moment just holding each other on the bed.
Cas shook his head.
“Well Cassie, breaking news I am worried. And I’m going to be worried until you’re better. So, stop worrying about me, worrying about you. Neither of us need the stress.”
“Well, it sounds to me like you’ve just run yourself into the ground and got yourself a case of the flu.” He gave Cas a thermometer. “Wait till it beeps.”
“Yeah I know. I’m sorry to crash on you and Eileen. Once the apartment contract is up at the end of the month I’ll find my own place.”
“Don’t start that Gabriel. Dean overheard Cas on the phone planning a weekend away with a lover, he knows Cas lied about the DOD training weekend and Balthazar picked up Cas’ phone the other day. It doesn’t take a genius to figure it out.”
“My drink.” Cas managed to force out.
………………………………………
“I’ll make it work.” Dean chuckled, pressing his lips against Cas’ tenderly and the moment they did it was like a fire ignited. It had been so long and there had been so much pain. Cas didn’t hesitate in opening his mouth for Dean and demanding entrance with his own tongue. Dean wanted to keep it gentle, he as worried about his fragile husband, but Cas clearly had no intention of this kiss being chaste. Dean opened his mouth willingly and ran his fingers up the back of Cas’ shoulders, massaging tight and tender muscles as Cas’ fingers roamed his chest and teased the hem of his shirt. Dean moaned when Cas nipped Dean’s lip with his teeth, which made Cas smile into the kiss.
“Dean!” Sam yelled, trying to get his brother to snap out of it.
“Thanks Sam.”
“Cas, that was fast.” Sam said, getting up to make sure Cas was stable on his feet.
“Yeah Angel, I’m here, what do you need?”
out, but I’m not heartless. I know you have nowhere to go, so stay here until you find a place, but I don’t want to see your face again.” Dean said bitterly, but perfectly calmly.
“You two are the biggest pair of idiots I have ever met. All of this because you didn’t talk to each other!” Sam thwacked Dean round the back of the head and his older brother didn’t protest.
Dean smiled Gabriel even had an elf owing him something. "I will start at the child friendly bunker now. Can you make dinner?’ Sam nodded and disappeared to the kitchen.
Sam nodded.” He is fine”. He gave Cas to Dean.
Dean looked at him with surprise and disbelief . "So someone tricked the archangel trickster how?
Kevin turned to Gabriel. "I thought he couldn't talk yet. He was a slow kid right?".
"Great you to wake the slow baby" Dean  was clearly angry. "He is slow for a reason Dean. He was the last angel who was created. God left so his energy was too far away so everything took twice as long. And I just sat with him because he doesn't understand sleeping quite that well".
Gabriel gave him an annoyed look. "You already start to sound like a mom to me".
Dean looked at him a little angry. "What do you mean inside he's just as old as he was, right?"
"Okay boys first a few rules before we enter the bunker. First rule you are only allowed to go to the main room, the kitchen, your bedrooms and the bathroom. Maybe some other places but then we will let you know. Second rule, nobody leaves the bunker without asking Sam or me first. Third rule, do what's asked from you. If I say clean the table you do it without complaining. Last rule for now no jokes, specially not on Cas. Understand?” Dean looked both boys in the eyes.
"Of course Dean'' Gabriel said . Dean didn't believe him for a second.
Ten minutes later Kevin found himself sitting at the table. Gabriel was playing a game on his phone while he eats.
He was worried, Dean was on a dangers hunt. Cas never let him go on a hunt like that without watching him. He couldn't help if necessary and Dean could die! He was stuck in this little body. A body that needs weird things. A body that didn’t allow him to say more as "De'n", And a mind that didn't stop him from wandering off and made him laugh when Gabriel put his hands in front of his face and said peek-a-boo. Who likes that?
"I think I need help Winchester” Balthazar his face changed real quick he looked almost if he was afraid.
"Go to Sam in the liberry second door after the kitchen and tell him what happened now". Bathazar starts running.
"What, why, did you do this?" Dean picked him up and walked back to the bunker.
"Dean, withs room we are going to give them," Sam asked.
Just as he wanted to put his trance coat on, his eye fell on Dean his jacket, what he left on the chair next to the bed. He put his hands between the bars and picked up the jacket. It was really heavy. It wasn’t easy to put the jacket in his bed. He felt the pockets and got his hands on some kind of a gum and a knife. He never tasted gum before but he always sees Dean eating it. He put one in his mouth. He picked up the knife and put it against the wooden bars. It shouldn't be that hard to saw them. He put Dean his jacket close to him, it smelled like Dean. It made him feel safe.
"You won't. I am a profit," he said, his voice sound weak.
"Just be careful and quick". Sam nodded and took his coat.
Sam nodded he was worried about Cas and he didn't even have the profound band that Dean and Cas shared. He knew Dean was even more worried.
When they arrived at the bunker. Dean picked Cas carefully out of Sam's arms and carried him inside.
The younger angel was already up and looked his brother right in the eyes and narrowed them.
"In the main room why?" he didn't forget the incident from yesterday.
Dean picks him up and carries him over the bars. Dean lifts him higher up and puts his nose very close to Cas his diaper. Cas finds this a strange thing he never saw Dean smell his underwear before. Maybe the diaper smelled like something Dean likes.
"Come on, Cas open up. This is really good stuff. Sam eats it all the time and you know how big he is". Dean looks really hopeful. Cas put more strength to his lips to make clear he doesn’t want any.
"I will carry you so you don't hurt your feet''. Balthazar looked like he was considering the offer before he looked at Dean again and nodded.
He turn around to Sam and Dean. Of course Cas chose that moment to start crying.
Cas was sitting in his bed. He stared at the bandages on his knees and feet. Dean was probably really mad that he put him in the bed cage again. He wasn't even tired. While he was really glad Dean found him he didn't think Dean should have the power to lock him up. He looks around in his room, it's black with only a chair and a table not really nice.
Dean was in shock. "Why would you change yourself in a kid". Dean didn't get the joke about that.
"How are those two". Dean turned to look at the other angels they were watching TV. Gabriel turned also around and his eyes wired when his glance met Cas.
Gabriel shook his head. "We have knowledge but emotional we have the same ages as our vessels look like. The same goes for recognizing danger, even sleep and eating. And this isn't a spell you can break you have to wait until your vessel is the same age again what it was before and then the spell will break".
"Sam you are a big grown-up, he is two years old. I bet you are stronger than him so make him open his mouth". Dean remembered how dad just opened Sam his mouth to brush his teeth.
Dean shook his head. "It doesn't change a thing. It's still a slow baby who doesn’t listen. I mean what kind of kid gets in so much trouble?”.
"Oh know not again. He was a terrible baby slow with everything, and really stupid".
"What is wrong?" Dean asked, scared. Gabriel almost can't hold his laugh.
"Dammit Cas you are a really bad boy". He took the jacket and gave Cas one last look before he took Balthazar and left the room. Cas sat alone in his bed cage again. He cried, he didn’t understand what was happening.
"Hey Cassie you can't sleep?" Cas looks sad to him. "Let me tell you something. When you were an angel baby anything took twice as long with you. So now it probably will as well. Most kids get teeth and start eating within a year or so I think at least. It means that you will learn it soon now”.
"We will find him Dean''.
Gabriel nodded. "Cas even needs diapers and a bottle because like I told you before, he is really slow at everything and he looks two and a half now. I am so glad I don't have to raise him again. Most angels started eating normally by the age of hunderd but it took Cas two hundred years”.
Dean was just finished with the camera when he heard Cas cry. He walked to the room to find Cas kicking and hitting his bed with his limbs. He picked him up.
"Sam, Dean, Cas is blue". He screamed like he was really scared. Sam turned around and Dean stopped the car.
"I’m supposed to eat now with you and Cas. Bathazar will be sleeping longer because of his night adventures".
He walked to the main room Cas put his head on his shoulder. Sam looked up when he walked in. "Hey Cas how are you doing?"
The boy shook his head. "So when a kid plays a joke on you, you don't threaten to kill them, but when a trickster plays a joke on you, you do?
Gabriel gave him a small pill. "This is one of the few magical pills that I still have. Put it in Castiel his mouth and play along. We will get a good laugh.
Dean scoffed a laugh, “Sammy would you chill? You need to relax. It
Dean rubbed at his eyes. He’d been awake for almost twenty four hours now and his eyes were failing him. He was standing in the chilled food aisle at 3 am and he just couldn’t read the label on the pizza box.
“So, I can meet you after school today and we can get started? It'll have to be after five because I have swim practice.”
“My girlfriend?”
“Cas, I am so sorry. Bobby called me in last minute. There was a large forest fire. I tried to text you, but I was trying to change out of my date outfit and find my car keys as well.”
Dean panicked, “I mean. It’s just that I’m bisexual but only my family know. Nobody at school knows. Well, maybe Charlie. But that’s because she’s a lesbian and she was the one who helped me figure it out for myself.”
Jack just stood stunned. “I’m part empty?”
Dean swallowed, his mouth suddenly dry. He knew he should be grateful for everything Bobby had done for them. From taking them in three years ago when his father had finally wrapped a car around a tree, to helping Sam every night with his homework.
It’s not so simple for me. Every time I enter the bakery, I think of the first time we met. When you ordered a small black coffee and an apple pie. I had told you we had run out, but you insisted. You had parked yourself on a barstool and refused to leave until I made a new one. It had taken an hour and during that time, you had served each of the customers while I was out back. Your charm had convinced every one of them into buying a pastry or cookie. I was in awe.
He shuffled to the counter, disappointed he wouldn’t be able to talk to Steve.
Maybe Dean had decided he didn’t want to date Cas. Maybe he didn’t like him and was only being polite. Cas told himself not to worry, that Dean was probably just late and would walk through the door any minute.
The clerk stepped around Dean and pulled open a fridge. Within a few minutes, he had replaced the pizza box with another.
He rubbed his eyes, it was another long shift at work today. They had to fight an office building fire, it had taken hours to control and die down and Dean’s muscles ached from the exertion.
“Thanks for this. I know that after this morning, you probably think I’m just a mess.” Cas was worrying at his sleeves, not looking at Dean as they walked the halls. Dean caught his breath and tried not to think about how adorable the trait was.
He noticed he was the only person in the store. That made sense, it was 3 am again.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Dean winced. “Am I a lost cause then?”
25.08.19
“I love you.”
01/07/19
Dean Winchester
“I love you.”
“It’s not your fault Dean.” Sam grabbed his hand.
Before he could say anything further, he caught sight of his brother running towards him. He found his feet again and braced as Sam careened into him.
This past month without you has been hard. Getting up and not seeing your smile. Not having your blueberry pancakes on Tuesdays. Not being able to read with you when it rains.
“I’m so sorry Dean. I thought I would be out of here by six but I’m only just leaving the office now. I should be home in ten minutes.”
Dean watched as his brother followed the teacher and slumped back against the stairs.
“I didn’t know that.” Cas whispered, grabbing Dean’s hand and squeezing.
What he didn’t expect was to be pulled off of Luke, almost immediately after he got his first punch in. Usually, it would take the teachers a few minutes to notice the commotion outside their rooms, and a few more minutes to break up the fight. But today, there he was, arms trapped behind him and a calming voice in his ear.
“So, do you have a girlfriend… or boyfriend then?” Steve asked.
You’ll be happy to know that I’ve been doing better. Sam’s been coming over more often. There aren’t any pro bono cases at the moment, and he’s found that his class is learning quicker than he thought they would. He’s been dragging me and Gabe around with him. Last week, we signed up for a pottery class. Obviously, that was a terrible idea. Gabe kept trying to recreate that scene from Ghost with Sam. But to be honest, Sam didn’t seem to be putting up much of a fight.
Dean felt on top of the world. “Well, I’ll catch you later Cas. If I don’t get this to my brother, I have a feeling he may just pass out and die.”
“Come on idiot. Get up!” Michael prodded at the lump with one of his feet.
“What’s your name? I’ve just been calling you hot firefighter in my head.”
already five minutes late. He had a feeling Shurley's late pass wouldn't stretch to his younger brother as well.
The worst part was that Dean hadn’t even sent him a text. Cas would have been fine if he had just let him know. He checked his phone and realised he could make his shift after all. At least he could earn some money tonight.
“Castiel was the angel of Thursday. My mother was pretty Catholic.”
“Dean. I know. I was just joking.”
I’m glad none of those thoughts were true. I’m hoping that it still isn’t true. I’m praying every day that you’re alive and safe, that you will come home to me.
As always, I love you Sam
“It’s a date.” Dean blurted. There was a pause and Dean panicked.
“I’m okay Dean. Cas and Benny stopped them before it got too bad. I’m just staying here while they go to Mr Roman.” Sam whispered hoarsely. He had opened his eyes, ever so slightly, and had relaxed his curl.
Cas smiled. “No strings. I’m here to stay.”
17/07/19
Dean only realised what the man had said when he landed in his bed twenty minutes later. He huffed a laugh and fell asleep.
The man’s smile dimmed ever so slightly, “I’m sure your girlfriend will. I’ll ring you up if that’s everything.”
Dean shook his head. “No, I meant that pizza wasn’t for my girlfriend. Sammy’s my brother. I was just so exhausted that I didn’t catch what you said until I got home. I was just coming off of a 20 hour shift and I hadn’t had a chance to sleep.”
Dean hated everything. Bobby had called him in at the last minute, apparently there was a forest fire and it was all hands on deck. That was nine hours ago.
Dean groaned, “Uh, I wish. I’ve been trying to find a vegetarian pizza for ages now, but I can’t seem to get it right. It’s like my hand is a meat magnet.”
Dean took a deep breath and pulled out the box.
Luke chuckled and stood back, Michael stepping up to flank him. Dean grabbed Sam’s shoulder and squeezed. Sam nodded, not looking at him. It was a method they used to use when dad was especially drunk, and they needed to check in with each other silently.
Dean nodded. He could totally see Cas as an angel.
Now he was alone. Billie was gone. Cas was…
Dean ruffled Sam’s hair and smiled while the younger boy frowned.
Dean frowned, he was sure it hadn’t been that long since he saw the man. Maybe he had lost track of the days, he was working way more shifts than he used to.
Cas just tilted his head and stared. Dean waited but couldn’t break the intense eye contact.
“Yeah Bobby. I know. But honestly it’s only home room and it’s the first day. It’s not like I’m going to need it to pass my exams.”
“Not to worry, I’ll get you fluent in no time.” Cas bumped his shoulder against his.
“What are you studying?” Dean felt the need to ask. If he could hear the man talk forever, he wasn’t going to complain.
“Sounds good to me.”
Luke smirked, “well you see, Deano. You messed with our family. So, we thought it was only right that we mess with yours. And it’s not like there’s anyone else. I mean, from what I hear, your mother killed herself in that fire and your dad wrapped himself around a tree just to get away from your sorry ass.”
The lump started groaning and it slowly unfolded into a more human form. Dean’s breath stalled. The boy was stunning. Messy dark curls topped a pale angular face. Long lashes framed big bright blue eyes. As he moved to stand, Dean noticed he had a thin but lean body covered in a soft blue sweater and long legs wrapped in dark skinny jeans.
Please make sure he’s eating well. I know Gabe’s there but… I don’t know, distract him for me.
“Oh, it is, Mikey. Didn’t realise little Samantha was going to run to momma bear like a little bitch.”
There lying on the bottom step, was Sam, curled up around his blue bag. Dean flew down the stairs, taking two steps at a time. He collapsed next to his brother, reaching a hand out to see where he was hurt.
Dean jerked back far enough to look into his eyes. “Just like that?”
Dean hummed, “yeah. We can go to Ellen’s if you like.”
Dean couldn’t help himself, he couldn't just stand by and watch. “Leave ‘em alone!”
“There must be a mistake. There’s no way I can fill in for God. How can I. I’m not even a full angel.”
Gabe came to help with the bakery. He’s not very good at the savoury goods but at least he can bake cookies. Charlie and Bobby love them, and they’ve been selling like hot cakes. It’s great because I haven’t been able to bake a pie since you left. The closest I’ve come is baking a loaf of bread, which I burnt.
Dean was stunned, it looks like they were headed to the same place. “First you’re in my home room, next you’re in my first period class? If I didn’t know better, I would say you’re following me around Cas.”
The voice was coupled to strong arms, forcing him away from the crowd. Dean took a breath, and then another, before slumping. The adrenaline had drained from him and he felt weak at the knees. His unlikely saviour noticed and managed to manoeuvre him over to the lockers, where he let his body slide to the ground.
“I have felt strange. But I thought it’s because I didn’t explode.”
The third time Dean walked into the store, he was fully intending to ask Steve on a date. He pulled into the nearly empty parking lot and tried to walk in as casually as possible.
Steve shook his head, “sorry. That’s the thing. My name isn’t Steve, it’s Castiel. Cas for short.”
The comment had it’s intended effect, a blush rising on Cas’ angular cheeks. Before he could say anything though, Dean turned him around and pushed him through the door.
He pulled up to the store and checked his phone. 3:05am.
Dean paused. That was his home room. “Yeah I can. That’s my one. Where did you transfer from?”
“You shouldn’t have had to be there at all. That’s what I explained to Mr Roman. And I spoke to my uncle Balthazar, he’s a member of the board. Apparently, he managed to convince Roman that he needed to get Mike and Luke under control. I’m not entirely sure what that means, but I have a feeling they won’t be around anymore.” Cas replied, easing himself onto the step next to Dean.
Cas frowned. That must have been hot firefighter. He hadn’t had a chance to explain he wasn’t wearing his own name tag the last time they had chatted. He hadn’t even noticed that he hadn’t introduced himself to the gorgeous man, that the firefighter had been mistaken.
Cas hadn’t been home late in months. When he first moved in, he was still finishing off his degree, so his schedule was all over the place. But after he landed his job with the small accountancy firm, he maintained regular hours, generally nine to five.
Sam looked at Jack. Jack’s eyes widened and he involuntarily took a step back.
The new death nodded. “I don’t plan on getting involved in your lives. I know how messy that can get. There is one thing I do have to say though.”
I guess when you said you wouldn’t write to me… you meant it. It’s been over two weeks since you left. I haven’t heard from you since but I’m assuming no news is good news. At least that’s what Sam said.
The second time you came in, I was ready with an apple pie, but you smiled and asked for a pumpkin one instead. Again, you welcomed the customers, while I baked. On your third visit, I realised that you didn’t know what pie you wanted until you knew which one was out of stock. When confronted, you admitted that you were deliberately wanting to spend more time with me. I told you we could do that over a drink.
I know I’ve been selfish.
“Are you okay? Did you forget something?” Dean asked, looking past Cas to see if he could spot anything on the floor. He noticed the short boy from earlier still with them, he was beaming. Apparently he had heard Dean's sorry excuse for an apology as well.
Sam gets involved
“It was awful Dean. They kept saying that dad started the fire because mum wanted to leave him. And that dad finally gave up trying to hide the fact that he was a murderer and killed himself because he was guilty. They just kept going and going and nobody stopped them.” Sam wailed into his shirt.
“You could never be a lost cause Dean. You just never understood the basics, so you struggle with the more advanced stuff. It’s a simple fix.”
After ten minutes had passed, a waitress came to ask his order. Cas had politely declined to order any food and just asked for a glass of water. After thirty minutes had passed, with no sign of Dean, Cas started to panic.
“Wow, that looks amazing on you.”
Michael turned to him and frowned. “Stay out of this Winchester. This is family business.”
“Of course. Yes!” Cas was kneeling on the floor with Dean now, his hands holding Dean’s face gently.
“Jack convinced the empty to let me go.” Cas whispered back, a hint of a smile in his voice.
Dean held his breath. The last time Sam had hugged him like this, was after the police told them that their father had died.
There was a lull in the conversation, Dean was still reeling from his conversation with Bobby earlier. He knew that he wasn't going to get straight A's, no matter how hard he tried. As long he didn't fail, Dean thought he was doing just fine. He wasn't the smart one in the family, that was Sam. Sammy would be the one going to college, Dean probably would just go full time at the autobody shop he worked at on the weekends. As they turned the corner right before they got to the English department, he heard a commotion. Dean's jaw tightened, if they wanted to get to room 303 on time, they would have to walk straight through the gathered students. From past experience, Dean knew that would be a bad idea but there was nothing he could do now, it would take twenty minutes to go the long way.
Of course, their relationship had its ups and downs. They both struggled when Dean’s work meant that they wouldn’t see each other for days. They had fights about the garden, the laundry and the stray cat that Cas kept feeding. But they always made up.
Sam was obviously concerned; he knew Dean well. He knew that Dean was ready to die for everyone, everything. His self-destructive nature was spiralling unpredictably.
Cas’ head jerked up at the comment. He tilted his head and Dean found himself pinned by an intense stare.
“You found yourself a keeper,” Bobby had said, slapping a hand on his back and passing a beer.
“I’m so sorry this happened, Mr Winchester. Mr Novak has told me everything. If you’d like to come with me, we’ll get everything sorted.” Mr Roman said, extending a hand to Sam.
He arrived at Ellen’s five minutes early. He had driven past the cute diner before but had never stopped to eat there. He pushed open the door and found a booth close to the front.
Dean growled low at that, Sammy was not a failure, he never would be, not on Dean’s watch.
Cas had been waiting for two weeks for the mysterious firefighter with beautiful green eyes, to walk back into the store.
“That’s an interesting name. Does it mean anything?”
Dean could risk it and buy it. But at the same time, if he came home with a pizza that wasn’t vegetarian, his brother would probably slaughter him.
How are you? I know it’s been a while since I last wrote. Maybe I shouldn’t have even written a letter to begin with.
Cas had tears streaming down his face by now. Dean steeled himself and popped open the box to reveal a slim silver band. “Cas, my love, will you marry me?”
What if it wasn’t you who sent it, but one of your superiors. What if it was a letter telling me you died? What if you weren’t coming back…
“I don’t need to be fluent, I just need a B in the next test.” Dean grumbled, riffling through his maths folder to find the offending failing grade. He found the paper, appalled by the amount of red on the page and handed it over for Cas to look at.
Most of the time, it would be Dean, but sometimes their classes would be on opposite sides of campus and Dean needed to get one of his very few friends to step in. On Tuesday, Dean had sports after lunch, while Sam had history, so he convinced Benny to swing that way while walking to economics. Charlie had his back on Wednesday when Sammy was in science and Dean had English.
“Can I help you?” a low voice called from down the aisle. He looked up to see the store clerk hovering.
I'm writing this at the desk in our room. Well, I guess it's your room now.
“Dean you know what I’m going to say right?” Mr Singer started, his voice a low growl so the last straggles of his classmates couldn’t hear.
Apparently, he had driven Charlie up the walls with how much he was talking about his late night shops with the adorable shop clerk. She had told him to either suck it up or ask the guy out.
Cas raised an eyebrow, “I may not be the incredible hulk, but I have my ways. Also, I’m a swimmer.”
Bobby had always been a family friend but for a while after both his wife and Dean’s mom died in the same fire, caused by Dean’s father, he had been distant. Mostly Dean was grateful that his father hadn’t pushed him away entirely, because otherwise, he and Sammy would probably have ended up in foster care. Dean wasn't sure he would be able to handle losing Sammy, he was the last thread he had to his family.
Three words seared into his mind, into his heart, into his shoulder.
Dean checked the clock again. Cas had told him that he should be finishing at six today. Dean had timed everything according to that. But it’s been an hour since and Dean was concerned.
Dean’s heart soared and he pulled Cas in for a kiss. His lips were chapped and salty from the tears, but it was perfect anyways.
Five agonisingly long minutes later, Dean pulled up in front of the store. He could see a person sitting behind the counter but couldn’t tell if it was Cas or not.
Maybe after several nights of no sleep and several days of no food, he was seeing things.
He walked around the living room, fluffing up the cushions Cas had bought. Most of them were a yellow and black striped design, it was crazy how obsessed with bees his boyfriend was. Dean had drawn the line at getting the matching bedroom set. He didn’t really want to wake up in a giant bee.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
. I wish I could hold you.
Finally, Cas spoke. “If you need help with maths, I can help. I’ve been getting straight A’s since sixth grade.”
Sam smirked at Dean through the mirror, still adjusting his hair. “Will you be one of those people Dean?” There was a teasing hint to his voice, but Dean struggled to hear it.
“No worries, I’ll see you when you get home. I love you.”
Cas nodded. “Does that mean you haven’t had a chance to eat then?”
Dean nodded but couldn’t say anything. His tongue was stuck.
Dean nodded, not trusting his voice just yet. He breathed through the lump and when he felt like he could talk again without crying he looked up and smiled.
When Cas started talking about another way, Dean couldn’t help himself. He allowed himself to have a small amount of hope. That tiny bud of hope, the only thing he has had when the impossible was facing him.
“Is he alright? Do you want me to help get him to the nurse?” The boy shook his head no. Dean waited for the boy to say something but he stayed silent, a hand on the lump.
Sam had loved Cas when he met him, so had Bobby.
If he had known what Cas was talking about, he would have crushed it before it bloomed.
“Goodbye Dean.”
“Has he told you what happened yet? How did he take down Billie? Did Cas do something to help maybe?”
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Cas stopped abruptly but Dean carried on walking for a few moments before noticing and backtracking.
Cas breathed in sharply, tears forming in his eyes. “Dean… is that what I think it is?”
His movements were sluggish. As if he was moving through treacle. Step after step until he reached the door. It creaked open and Dean’s knees buckled.
Dean looked at the new nametag, Castiel.
“But Bobby, my grades aren’t slipping. At least they weren’t last year! I’m doing the work.” Dean tried to argue.
He would have panicked too if Cas hadn’t looked up, smiled and replied, “I love you too, Dean.”
“Well, that day I didn’t get to ask you out, but I was hoping to remember this day differently in the future.”
“Dean? Are you okay? Where’s Billie? Where’s Cas?”
Dearest Dean
Dean stood slowly. Everything in his body was drained and heavy. He had no motivation to move. No motive to talk. But Sam was calling him. It sounded urgent.
I’m not asking you for much, just something small to let him know you’re doing okay.
Dean clamped down on his rising rage and tried to focus on the dark head in front of him. Eventually, Dean found himself at the front of the crowd, students pressing up against his back trying to get a good view. Dean was so focused on Cas, he hadn’t noticed exactly who was in the centre, but now he had full view. He was shocked to find Sam standing in front of him.
Maybe he should cut more lavender? Before he could decide, Cas’ key slid into the lock and the door swung open.
I just couldn’t help myself, I had to write it down. How I felt. Looking over at you, sleeping peacefully, it’s the first time that I have stopped myself from curling up in your arms. I had to drag myself away, because if I let myself stay, well, I would never leave.
Dean gripped the frame tightly. He couldn’t believe it. He had to be hallucinating. Cas was gone. There was no way he was standing in front of him right no-
“That’s not true Cassie. He’s pissed that you came to live with me and mum because now he’s stuck having to control the fights between Luke and dad. You know how they blow up. Remember the last one? You ended up in hospital.” The shorter boy muttered before shoving the lolly back into his mouth.
“I don’t… have a boyfriend. Do you?” Dean replied.
Dean slumped in relief and let himself smile.
Dean nodded, “I’m sorry, Sammy. I should have been here. If I had just passed my test, Mr Shurley wouldn’t have held me back. This wouldn’t have happened if I could just understand stupid geometry.”
“It’s okay, Sammy. Don’t listen to their lies. Mum’s death was an accident and so was dad’s. I won’t let them near you again. I swear they won’t come close.” Dean crushed Sam closer to him and let him sob into his shirt.
“It’s been hard for all of us, but I think Dean’s taking it the worst.”
“Ah. Yes, sorry. Can you just tell me what pizza this is? My eyes have given up on me.” Dean held the box out to the man, attempting a smile that was quite possibly a grimace.
The new death smiled. “Apparently, when he got you out, he exchanged his life. The empty made a deal with him. ‘I will take you in your happiest moment’, or something like that. Not sure what happened to make him happy, but Cas summoned the empty and the empty took both of them.”
Dean finally replies
Dean could feel the tears seeping through the cotton and tried to stay calm. He knew that if he went to find Luke and Michael right now, he would probably kill them.
have a problem with me being gay?”
It was a month before he finally went back. Sam had been cramming for his finals and had completely run out of all food. He was desperate and apparently, ‘he would eat anything. Even a cheeseburger.’
Bobby had finally given the all clear and Dean didn’t even grab a shower. He legged it to his car and sped to the only place he knew Cas could be.
Dean was confused. “But your name tag?”
He nodded and shuffled closer. The man put a hand into his pocket and pulled out an adorable pair of glasses. Dean should probably invest in a pair himself.
Dean had been on high alert for almost a week. He had been watching out for Luke and Michael and making sure Sam always had someone to walk him to class.
“At least the world isn’t on fire”, Sam said every day.
Finally, Cas spoke. “I’m so sorry you had to deal with that Dean. I understand what it’s like to have a toxic person in your life. I hope you’re in a better situation now.”
Fully standing, the boy was only a few inches shorter than Dean, which let Dean get a really good look at the large purple bruise that was starting to form on the boy’s jaw.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
“You need to breathe, Dean. Calm yourself, Luke wants you to do this. Don’t stoop to his level.”
Dean nodded and shut his mouth, turning to the door as it reopened. That familiar mop of dark hair was back, peaking through the gap.
“No string attached?” Dean needed to be certain.
Sam had also found it strange, but he hadn’t looked into it. He was worried that maybe they hadn’t fully done it after all.
“Ooh, so the little Winchester needs his big scary brother to protect him. Isn’t that just adorable Luke?” Michael sneered.
The boy, Cassie?, rubbed the back of his head. “Yeah, alright, maybe that’s the reason. Anyways, my name is Castiel. But you can call me Cas. You’re Dean?”
It’s been a month since your last letter.
“It’s a date, then. I’ll catch you later Dean.” Cas pushed off and left a stunned Dean sitting on the stairs.
Dean watched as Cas frowned at the paper. Every so often, he would hum and nod before his frown deepened.
Winchester failure.”
He shuffled after the man, paid for the pizza with a thank you and left.
“Dean didn’t do anything. Well, he delivered a killing blow to Billie, but that was before.”
“It’s okay, I got you out of there before you could do any real damage. Plus, Luke was being a prat. If you hadn’t done anything, I probably would have smacked him around too.” His voice shook slightly, so Dean wasn’t sure he was being entirely truthful, but he appreciated the sentiment.
Dean couldn’t stop himself, he flung himself at the nearest of the two brothers and slammed his fists into his mouth. He couldn’t hear the yelling over the blood roaring in his ears, but he knew it would be there. People yelling at him to stop, people yelling to hit harder. It wasn’t his first fight, he knew how this would go.
“Hello Dean.” Cas rasped. Tears were falling out of his perfect blue eyes.
“How’s he doing?” Sam asked as Jack came back with a full plate. Jack shook his head and put the plate down heavily.
Luke looked over his shoulder and focused his sneer in Dean’s direction. “Well if it isn’t Dean Winchester.” Luke brushed his knees and paced towards him, walking directly into Dean’s personal space, not stopping until his chest was right against his.
He sensed something was off a second before he turned the corner. Once he was on the stairs, his heart fell to his stomach.
Jack gestured for her to continue.
“Come on Samantha. If you keep preening like that, we’ll be late for school.”
20.07.19
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
P.S. I'm doing well, I went to mom's grave yesterday and left a tulip for her. I asked her to watch over you while you're over there.
Dean’s hands curled into fists at his sides. He didn’t want to get into a fight today, but he would if he heard another word about Sam.
Cas remained silent. Dean had no idea why he needed Cas to understand but he did.
Sarah smiled back, tugging at the apron and stepping out from behind the counter. “Yes, there was a guy. He bought a bag of chips and asked about Steve. Other than that, though, there wasn’t anyone else.”
Dean’s eyes widened. “Oh no!”
Stay safe my love, I’m waiting for you.
I think I may add in other character letters as well. Could be interesting to write from other perspectives.
Castiel.
He made quick work of the groceries and found himself at the counter ready to pay.
“What are you saying?” Jack asked.
“Sammy? What’re you doing here?” Dean stepped forward towards his shaking younger brother but was stopped with a hand to his chest.
Dean nodded and slid onto a knee. “Castiel Novak, from the day I met you, I knew you would be someone important in my life. Those 3 am grocery shops were the highlights of my weeks. And now, the last year we have spent together, the good and the bad, I know I want to spend the rest of my life like that.”
Cas pushed open the staff door and smiled at Sarah. “Anyone come in while I was out back?”
couldn't get you out of it this time.”
“You’re really here. How are you here?” Dean whispered hoarsely. He could feel tears forming again. He wrapped his arms around Cas tightly and breathed deep. He felt Cas’ arms wind around him slowly.
“Thank you, Cas. I don’t know what I would have done if you weren’t there for him.” Dean sighed, rubbing a hand over his face.
Dean swallowed, an unwanted image of Cas in nothing but a speedo, invading his mind. “Well, thanks anyways. If Roman caught me in a fight today, I probably would have been suspended.”
Dean woke up to the loud ringing of first bell. Apparently, he had slept right through home room again, he had promised Mr Singer he wouldn’t do that this year. He shuffled out of his seat and made his way to the front. Mr Singer was staring at him and there was a slight downward turn to his mouth. Dean sighed and came to a stop in front of the desk. He waited for the majority of the class to leave, mentally psyching himself up for the lecture he was about to receive.
Sam shook his head. “Okay. So, the empty has Cas. Can we get him back? Is that why you’re here?”
Dean smiled and threw his own tattered bag into his Baby before starting her up.
Cas surged forward and planted a kiss on his lips. Dean could taste the honey from Cas’ sandwiches, and the salt from his tears.
I know you’re receiving Cas’ letters. I talked to one of your commanding officers.
He wanted to wait at least five minutes before following the little tyke through the rusting double doors, but while he waited, tapping his fingers along to AC/DC, he heard a thud sound near his trunk.
Dean looked up and found himself staring up at Cas’ big blue eyes. He seemed concerned, the crease between his eyebrows was back and his mouth was turned downwards.
Hey little bro, I sent a letter to Cas, make sure he gets it. Thank you for making me get my ass into gear. I wasn’t thinking about how much Cas would be hurting.
Cas blushed. “Oh, well… I overheard you talking to Bobby earlier this week about your grades. And just now you were talking to Sam. I didn’t mean to overhear.” Cas stuttered.
“I appreciate it. But we should probably get going. We don’t want to be late. As much as I love Singer, he really is a hardass when it comes to tardiness.”
That was until sixth period on Friday. Sam had just finished his maths class and Dean was supposed to walk with him from maths to English. But Mr Shurley held him back wanting to speak to him about his last test grade.
“I’m home!” Cas called, dropping his keys into the dish next to the door and shrugging off the brown trench coat that was a staple of his outfit.
Standing behind the door, in his familiar beige trench coat, in his navy suit and crooked tie. Standing behind the door was his Cas.
The new death nodded solemnly. “Ever since you exploded, the empty has been more awake than ever. It’s pissed. I haven’t been able to calm it down yet. I was hoping you could.”
Bobby had caught wind of the situation and tried to convince Dean to just tell Roman, but Dean didn’t think the headteacher would believe him. He was fine this way anyways. Michael and Luke hadn’t shown their faces since the first day of school, and it looked like they weren’t planning to anytime soon.
“You’re looking wonderful today, and why did you cut the lavender?” Cas leant to smell the bouquet Dean had placed on the table.
I have a feeling you’re behind all of this Dean Winchester, and I really appreciate it.
“I love you too, Cas. I’m sorry I didn’t say it before. But I do.” Dean whispered, foreheads pressed together.
Cas sat and nervously fiddled with his sleeve. He hoped he hadn’t dressed up too much. He was wearing a light blue shirt that Gabriel had told him would make his eyes pop. He was wearing his nicest jeans, but only because all of his others were torn and dirty from all the gardening he had been doing recently.
“Dean your grades aren’t slipping because they’re already the lowest you can get without failing. Dean you’ve averaged a C in every class for the last year. I know you’re better than that. Please just try for me. This is your last year here, try to make the best of it.”
I love you, my angel. Know that you’re my light in the darkness, my beacon of hope.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
“Get your filthy hands off of me.” Dean practically spat in his face.
Dean had nothing to say. There was a hole, a void, a vacuum, in the bunker. There was a cold emptiness seeping in.
“When Dean first struck Billie with the scythe, it was fatal. Any wound by the scythe is fatal, no matter how big or small.”
The store clerk, Steve it said on his badge, scrunched up his eyebrows. “Yeah, I served you the other day. You were looking for a vegetarian pizza at 3 am? For Sam.”
“That will be two dollars please.” The woman smiled, waiting for Dean to grab the change from his pocket.
“Honestly, dude, I really don’t know how to repay you.”
He pushed away from the counter and walked away with his shopping.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Jack inhaled in surprise. “He summoned the empty? How?”
Take him to that community college you’re always hanging about and get him to teach a class. Or get him to take one. Just keep him from thinking about me.
Dean nodded, “Yeah. I mean with my work, I barely get a chance to meet new people. Everyone I know, either lives with me or works with me. And it’s not like I want to date one of my colleagues.”
Dearest Dean,
He looked to the owner, Luke who was smirking up at him. “Lookie here, Mikey,
He had never been happier.
Dean flushed. “Okay, okay. My name is Dean. Dean Winchester. And I would love to go on a date with you.”
“Hey! Buying food for Sam again?”
Sam had sent him a list of groceries again and Dean pulled into the 24 hour store. He could wait until later today, but he might as well get it out of the way now.
Even if I only get to look at your face for a few days, even if I get to hold you in my arms for a few hours. Even if we only get to share one meal, it would be enough.
Why was Dean telling this stranger all of this? He hadn’t even told Bobby half of the gruesome details.
Steve finished scanning the shopping and rung him up. Dean handed over the money and smiled. “Well thank you, Steve. Maybe I’ll see you again sometime.”
Dean let himself break. The lump in his throat burned and choked him. Sobs wracked his cold body.
And yes, I did tell you that I wouldn't write to you while I'm away. And that I don't want you to write to me either; that it's sappy and cliché, but watching you lying in our bed, wearing my t-shirt…
“Oh hey! Did your girlfriend like the pizza?” the store clerk asked.
Dean shrugged. “Well, it is our anniversary.”
Dean swallowed through the lump forming in his throat, “Sammy, you know I would never hurt you right? I’m not like dad...”
Cas just shrugged. They fell into a comfortable silence. Dean struggled to find anything to say, anything that didn’t involve asking Cas on a date that is.
Dean was confused. He looked up and found himself staring at a familiar man. It was the store clerk from a few days ago.
your first day at high school after all. Take it from me, if you walk in there with perfect hair, someone is going to try and beat you up.”
Cas huffed a laugh, pecking him on the cheek before getting up and walking to the living room cupboard.
Steve’s hand hovered over the last bit of his shopping. “I’m trying to finish my accountancy degree. I should be finished this year. Once I am, I will probably be able to meet more people.”
The new death sighed and rested their scythe against the wall.
“Didn’t you find it strange that you could defeat God? How were you able to this time, when until now you were still following whatever he wrote?” the new death added.
Luke huffed and dragged Michael away, muttering something about getting payback. One of the other boys left with them, probably one of their freshmen lackeys.
“Ok Cassie. You will tell me though, right? Later?”
“Huh.” Dean hummed, not really listening.
“Hospital baby bro, you remember?” Gabriel offered gently.
Dean hated Doctors before all this. He hated them even more now. He hated hospitals, and doctor’s surgeries and medical speak. If they weren’t so damn good at saving people Dean would want to punch them all in the face.
“You’re not fine sweetheart, you can’t be, not after what happened.”
Cas had grown up friends with the Winchesters, they were an unlikely group. The Winchesters were popular and well liked, Cas withdrawn and awkward. His family were deeply Christian, Catholic more specifically which made them deeply homophobic. They had known of Cas’… disposition since he was 13 and they had practically placed him on house arrest because of it. No Son of theirs would have relations with men.
“It’s fine. Dean will be home soon.” Cas said unconvincingly.
There was no more Dean Winchester in his contacts.
“Damn it I wanted to get you home.” Gabriel said, pushing a strand of hair back off his brother’s forehead fondly.
“Ok.” Cas said hesitantly. He felt like he’d just hit a nerve. “What’s wrong? Where are you going?”
Dean pulled Cas close to him, tears wetting his cheeks. “I’m so sorry I made you feel like that.”
“Yes, it’s up in Atlanta. He left his bags here.”
“I don’t know.” Sam answered honestly. “I knew he’d been working late, but I didn’t… Look, Gabe, let me talk to him, see if we can’t get this straightened up, because my brother adores Cas I know he wouldn’t be cheating on him.”
……………………………..
Sorry its a bit of a filler, but I'd rather post something than wait to give you a super long chapter and this will take off some of the suspense.
“That’s ok Mr. Novak. Nobody really listens to that rule anyway. I would advise in you condition that you really should be avoiding stress at all costs. Your weight and blood test results are alarming.”
“It wasn’t you.”
“Sammy!” Dean called, but there was no answer. “He must be outside.”
The ruckus had attracted the attention of the nurses in the corridor.
“Ermm. Yes.” Gabriel started, gathering his thoughts. “Maternal side… grandmother, uncle, cousins…”
“Ermm, don’t know, just got back, guessing he’s in bed after his shift.”
“Right ok, let’s get a plan in place, extend the radius to 5 miles to be safe, make a list of people he knows, places he might go… what would you do if you were in his shoes.
“What I don’t get is that if Dean wasn’t cheating on me, why didn’t he come home for weeks? I still don’t understand, it still explains nothing.” Cas pulled at his thinning hair in frustration and Gabriel quickly guided his hand away.
“Yes. Things really haven’t been good the last 6 months.”
Dean took a breath and let himself think rationally. “How about this… You ask for what you want, and I’ll ask permission before I touch you in any way. Neither of us assumes anything and don’t you think for a second that me being cautious around you means I don’t want to touch you, because that couldn’t be futher from the truth. I want to hold you and never let you go again Cas, I want to take you home and never let anything hurt you again.”
“I’m just glad having cancer gives me immunity to your pranks.”
“Gabriel, Dean and Cas broke up.”
The line was silent for a moment. “You… you don’t know do you?”
“I’m so sorry, I just… I wasn’t thinking straight. All I couldn’t think about was… I felt… I feel…” Cas sighed, and Dean just pulled him closer offering a squeeze of comfort and encouragement.
“I’ll start from the beginning.”
“I know. It’s just…”
…………………………
“I know Dean, and so did I… I mean, you two were…”
“You tell me every day Cas.” Dean chuckled.
Yes, I know, I know, I am very sorry for the ending.
“Is that a problem?” Cas growled.
out of money and he was nowhere near drunk. After the cab fare he’d barely had enough for a beer.
“You’re puling over already?” Sam smiled wryly. Dean usually drove for hours, but they were pulling into the gas and sip not 15minutes from Sam’s house.
……………………….
“Doing better.”
“Cas wait!” Dean pleaded, but the door slammed shut.
“Cassie, you have to take better care of yourself.” Gabriel fussed, caressing the side of his brother’s face. “You’ve been out nearly four hours. The doctors were worried sick.”
“Do you get sick pay?”
“Gabriel please…” Dean asked, wanting a chance to explain, that he was only shouting because he was worried.
Cas didn’t say anything, he just looked out the window, something un-readable in his expression.
Dean fell to his knees and covered his face. His heart fluttered painfully as he realised what Cas had meant when he’d begged for forgiveness, what that broken and desperate look in his eyes had meant. Of course, Cas hadn’t cheated on him! How on earth could he have ever thought that?
“Cas…” Dean started, then paused to think through his words. He knew all too well about his own incredible ability to put his foot in his mouth. “Yes, I’m struggling too, I’ll admit that, but I don’t want you to worry about me. We’ll go to see Pam together and that will help, but if you really want to know what worries the most…”
“Gabriel, it’ll be ok, he’s probably just gone on a bender he’ll be holed up in a bar somewhere…”
Cas was earning $7500 a month and Dean’s new manager’s salary was giving them $6700 and the business profits where coming to around $18G. They were bringing in $32 K a month but they had been coming up $80 short every month since they’d hired the new guys. The mortgage was huge. He’d surprised they’d even been granted to it, but the business figures seemed to have done the trick, even if they were rather overestimated.
“So, it’s both kidneys?”
The door swung open suddenly and a shaky, red eyed Dean barged out, holding his phone.
They both shared a silent moment before moving through the house to the kitchen.
“But…”
“Anyway, the reason I know about Cas’ case, is because, well, its my case now. Cas asked me to be his lawyer and I promise you both Dean, I’m going to do everything in my power to make these bastards pay.” Sam said solemnly.
“That’s great Dean. That’s really great, and I’d love to, but...”
“Hey!” Cas protested.
“What can you tell me?” Sam tried. ‘Damn lawyers’ Gabriel growled to himself, but he couldn’t deny he like Sam and he knew he cared about Cas, even if his brother was a douchebag.
Dean smiled. “Yes her. She’s a therapist Cas and I was wondering if you wanted to try going to see her. I could come if you want, or you could go on your own, but I think I’m going to go see her myself anyway, work out my anger against the demons who did this to you.”
The doctor’s office was horrendously busy, and the noise was making Cas’ headache worse and worse. Sam checked him in and sat down next to him as they waited. Cas was looking very fragile and up close he could see just how much weight he’d lost. It was frightening, and Sam was beyond worried, but they were here now, they’d get it sorted.
“I’m ok now Dean. Just a little tired.”
He came home to share the news with Cas. He felt awful that he’d seen so little of him, but now it was time to make it up to him. Cas could quit that second Job. They could have weekends together and start saving to pay off that mortgage quicker. Maybe in a few years they could get that house. He’d checked the new accountant properly this time and signed off on contract with a local business to supply and maintain all of their vehicles. Things were finally looking better.
“I didn’t call to argue about all of this Gabriel. We were at the Gas and sip that Cas used to work at and they told us he’d resigned because he was ‘seriously ill’. What is going on? Dean is worried sick. I’m worried sick because I’ve seen how much weight Cas had lost. I really don’t care what’s happened between him and Dean at this point, because at the end of the day Cas was… is our friend and we care about him.”
“What!” Sam couldn’t believe that. Cas wasn’t the type.
“Yeah of course we can.” Dean said, wondering if he should ask why. But Cas offered the explanation of his own accord.
“Hey Cas, Jake in yet?” Anna asked him with a smile, twirling a finger through her read hair.
“Dean?” Sam and Jody came running over, faces filled with questions.
“I’m coming Dean. I’ll be 20minutes. Please…”
“I’m still not happy with you Deano.” Gabriel growled a little.
“I love you.”
“What’s up with Castiel?” She asked quietly, following him to the kitchen. “He looks miserable. Where is Dean?”
“Will you marry me?”
“It’s under your name, but we both know how much money Castiel put into that place and the fact is, he has paid most of the mortgage payments. You might be forced to sell the business and split the money.”
“No, nothing like that.”
“It doesn’t matter…”
“Sam.”
“Noted Sherriff. I’ll send forensics to the scene and some officers to see what evidence we can collect.”
In the meantime, hope you enjoyed it and thanks for the support.
“Ok, fine. Electricity is good.” Dean conceded. “So, where is it? What are the hours? Tell me everything…”
Deans’ shoulders dropped instantly, his jaw tensing remarkably. “Yes.” Dean said gruffly. Technically that was still true and the girl clearly didn’t know what had happened so it didn’t make sense to take it out on her.
“Anyone in your family have a history?”
“He said it was up to you to decided what I know.” Dean bit his lip. “Just please tell me you’re not dying, just please tell me that after all of this I’m not going to lose you again.” Dean begged, trembling.
………………………………..
“Yes Dean.”
It's quite a short update, but it was important to me that this chapter was at least 90% happy.
“Yes, sleep well Cassie.”
“Cas, please say it for me.” Dean begged and Cas whimpered sadly.
“The pair of absolute Idjits!” Bobby growled. “You want me to ping his cell.”
“I won’t do anything stupid.” Dean promised.
“Dean what’s going on?” Cas asked, feeling a little uneasy, but then Dean just pressed a kiss to his lips.
“Don’t say it Sam. I can’t…” Dean choked and leant heavily into his brother’s shoulder. “It’s my own fault anyway. I should never have bought the damn garage. Everything was perfect before then.”
……………………………
“Ok. If you say so.” Dean said in a disgruntled tone and Cas frowned at the other end of the line. He was about to retort when the line went dead.
“I found Cas outside O’Malley’s on shift the other night.”
“An argument?”
“Yeah. It’s fine.” Cas sighed.
Sam’s heart suddenly skipped. “Dean said he left him in the house, are you sure he wasn’t there?”
“Yes.” Cas smiled rubbing his nose against Dean’s cheek with a smile, while Dean looked at Gabriel a little sheepishly.
“Gabriel, he wants to see you.” Jody smiled weakly.
“It appears to be very aggressive and progressing quickly. You are showing all the symptoms of kidney failure, though it appears that this has preceded the cancer by some time and may even have triggered it.”
“It’s ok Hun, it’s ok. It’s Jody, you’re at my house. Do you remember what happened sweetheart?”
“Oh, Thank God.” A voice breathed in relief.
Dean looked up at his brother and wiped his face.
Gabriel sighed. This was awkward. “I can’t tell you Sam. Because Cas doesn’t want either of you to know and I promised.”
"Sam..." Dean whined.
“Where?” Gabriel asked.
“It wasn’t my fault.” He mumbled. But he couldn’t believe those words.
suggest that of me!” Cas yelled back, unseen tears brimming in his eyes, is that what Dean really thought?
“Oh great, I’ll go to the pet shelter and pick up a Cat, then.” Cas grabbed the keys to the Ismpala out of Dean’s hand and mockingly started to march towards the door.
“What are you, a spaz? Or are you just stoned?”
“I do Dean. I don’t want you to keep things from me because you worry how I might react. We should be a team. ”
“No, everything’s ok baby bro, its just better you hear it from an expert rather than two idiots like us.”
“Yeah, we’ve both been at the grindstone a bit.” Dean sighed
“I’m fine.”
“What am I doing here?” Jody scoffed. “I got a call of a disturbance in the bar, what the hell are you doing at O’Malley’s, this place is full of the scum of the Earth.”
“We need to find Cas. Now!”
“Cas, what do you want for dinner?”
“Heard what?” Gabriel exclaimed, his face darkening in worry. “Where is he, where is Cassie?”
“Yeah, like who?” Dean asked.
“How much sleep do you get per night.”
Cas shivered and screwed his eyes shut, gripping Dean tighter. “I know.” Cas whimpered.
“You’ll put your back out again.” Cas said with a raised eyebrow.
“What, what did I say?” Gabriel asked concerned.
Cas suddenly felt a burning anger. Had Dean even checked this guys’ references? He gripped his nose tight and stood up in frustration. His head suddenly started to feel very fuzzy and the room tilted violently as his head spun and vision pixelated. He gripped hard onto the table and puffed a few deep breaths. He’d been getting dizzy a lot lately, but that’s the worse it had been. He was just tired.
But he was starting back at his job tommorow and he wanted to get an early night.
“Honestly Dean, there is not point wishing or dwelling on what happened. It happened. I can’t change it, you can’t change it. I’m happy now, I’m happy with you isn’t that enough?”
Cas didn’t answer, he just marched painfully out of the door, not even remembering to pick up his coat.
Deans hand tightened around the steering wheel until his fist was shaking and white.
“Really?”
We are getting close to the end of this one now, but I have extended the chapter count a little as I need to bring this to a more satisfying ending.
“It’s ok Cas.” Sam moved in quickly but carefully, putting a comforting hand on his shoulder. “With the evidence we have, I’m hoping your statement will be enough, and if it isn’t there are a thousand ways for you to testify without having to be in the room or deal with cross examination. Leave it to me ok, you don’t need to worry. Go enjoy yourself.”
Double update day for you since chapter 11 was so short.
“Not much.” He sighed sadly. Dean smiled reflexively. He knew Cas was trying to be positive and that it was exhausting. He knew he couldn't manage it all the time and it was more than normal for him to be feeling this way, but it didn't change the fact He hated seeing Cas like this., He just wanted so badly to take away all his pain, but he knew he couldn't.
“It helped a lot.” Cas smiled. “They took out the worst affected kidney and hopefully another course of chemo will clear up the one I have left and get rid of any that’s spread. But until that happens I will have to stay in hospital, I need regular dialysis until my kidney is healthy.”
“Well, if you’re lucky someone might give you a massage to make it better.” Cas said with a wry smile, pressing a kiss to Dean’s lips, chests separated by the box Cas was holding. Dean hummed into Cas’ mouth and deepened the kiss.
“Yep.” Dean winced.
“Wait, he collapsed, here?” Dean asked, confused.
“I’ll try my best Dean.” Cas said, still a little spacey, but his eyes stayed open.
“No, I’m sorry.” Cas sighed again. He hated disappointing Dean.
‘Thank God’ Jody sighed to herself. That was a small mercy at least. “Dean, Cas didn’t cheat on you he was raped.” Jody blurted out.
“We are the official owners and managers of Singer’s Autos!” Dean said, waving a folder of paperwork in the air.
“I am… I just got off the phone with my boss. I explained the situation and he’s been, well he’s been great. They are getting me leave and I will still have a position if I get better. They just want me to work the week out till they can get a stand in.”
“I tried to ring him on your phone, but he wasn’t picking up.”
“Cas, buddy can you hear me?” Jake asked frantically. There wasn’t even a glimmer of a response.
“No way.” Dean scoffed, pouring pancake batter into the pan. "I'll go with Cas, but I ain't seeing no shrink."
“But what if you can’t…” Gabriel spoke up.
“Well I’m really glad it hasn’t, you deserve a win. Besides I love your sex hair.” Gabriel grinned rubbing his brother’s shoulders.
“No, it doesn’t.” Sam agreed. “We all just need to keep level heads from here on in. Cas is what matters here. If Dean finds out who did this, I’m worried he’d going to do something stupid.”
“Why?”
“My baby brother’s stronger than the lot of us. I know he will.” Gabriel huffed. He knew Cas would, but he wasn’t sure he wanted him to. Yes, he wanted the evil sons of bitches to rot in prison for the rest of their lives, but Cas came first and he didn’t want him to go through any more than he already had. “I’m his big brother Sam, I was supposed to protect him.”
“Relax Cas, we’re fine. Aren’t we?” He added concerned.
“Not all Christians condemn what we are Dean and I know you don’t share my beliefs…”
“I know.” Gabriel whispered, sadly. His gaze drifting over his little brother laid on the sofa under a blanket, the dialysis machine whirring in the background.
“He has another round of chemo tomorrow and then they are going to assess if surgery will be successful.”
Cas had broken down, then surrounded by his friends he had told them everything, from his family to the fact he was gay. Cas would have loved to have said that it had made everything better, but it hadn’t. His friends had been amazing, but eyes had been on him all the time making sure he ate, making sure he slept and took days off training. He’d felt just as trapped as he’d always had, that was when Dean wasn’t visiting him.
“I’m cold Dean.” Cas sighed.
He knew that smarmy British voice. It was that douche Balthazar. Cas’ so called best friend. He’d always been convinced that guy had been trying to get into Cas’ pants. They were far too close to be just good friends.
…………………………..
“Yes, the garage.” Dean sighed. “I just, being the manager, it’s not what I thought it would be at all and… I hate it Cas. I hate the hours I hate the paperwork and the taxes and the dealing with customers. I missed the garage, I missed the cars, I missed Benny and the guys, so when I finished my shift and I was stressed and mad and in no fit state emotionally to come home to you I went down there, and I tinkered. Then maybe we’d go out for a few beers and it would get late and I didn’t want to come home tipsy and wake you up when I knew you were working so hard… so I stayed on Benny’s couch some nights, or just slept in the impala, or just stayed out.”
“My pleasure.” He smiled and nodded at the bar man. “What are you drinking to forget?”
“I’m telling you this only so you are aware of the situation, but my brother has cancer.”
“We’re going on a road trip.”
She called Dean. That way if Cas wasn’t up to talking he wouldn’t have to. She had spent her stint of insomnia compiling a list of names and organisations that would help Cas recover from this and help Dean to cope with a traumatised fiancée.
10 long years had passed, and a lot had changed. But a lot had stayed the same. Dean and Cas still lived in the house they’d bought in Washington. Dean’s business was thriving, Balthazar was still annoying, Cas still worked too hard, although Dean kept a much closer eye on things these days. There had been no sign of the cancer in 10 long years, so the Doctor’s had told Cas he was cured.
Cas sighed a little. “I was thinking what a beautiful place it would have been, to run in the park over there.”
“Can I come stay with you please.” Cas asked, voice breaking.
After another heavy meeting with Crowley Dean just wanted to get away. Thinking about all of this, he just wanted his Cas back. He hovered his finger over the call button, knowing it was a bad idea, but maybe, just maybe they could work this all out.
“Well, here’s the final box… had to leave you something to do. We’ll leave you both to it. Happy new home Cas.” Sam smiled, pushing the box towards Dean.
“I didn’t tell him Cas and they’d already figured it half out, I had to fess up.”
Cas stepped out of the bathroom of the luxury apartment in Atlanta his brother had rented. He was only wearing a white bath robe and gently rubbing a towel through his messy wet hair.
“Yes, yes you are Dean. All it would have taken is a phone call to me saying, I’m working late at the moment, would someone keep an eye on my self-neglecting husband and make sure he doesn’t let himself waste away.”
“How can you still have faith after everything that happened to you?” Dean scoffed.
……………………………
“I’ll tell him if you drop me off at home, I just...”
“Just need to catch up on some sleep.” Cas admitted, but he was thinking maybe he wasn’t quite well enough to come back to work yet.
‘I love you’ He’d said. He called them Babe, they’d called him baby. And they were having a weekend away together. Dean sat down heavily, waves of shock rolling over him.
“God had nothing to do with it.” Gabriel scoffed.
“Fiancée Sam, fiancée… and screw you! Fine! I’ll go see Pam.”
“That may well be the case Dean. Its probably completely overwhelming for him at times. Again, I don’t mean to criticise, but the way we are constantly fussing over him, asking if he’s ok,  it probably only keeps reminding him of the reasons he shouldn’t be. He's trying really hard to move on from this, I can tell and he’s doing really well, but if you noticed he’s much more relaxed around Gabriel and I think that’s because Gabriel doesn’t treat him any differently than he did before.”
Dean took a deep breath. “Cas, please tell me it isn’t what I’m thinking right now… please tell me you didn’t go out last night and… sleep with some random stranger.”
“Well you came in with hypothermia, but the doctors said your core body temperature is back to normal. How do you feel?”
“No, that’s fine.”
“Yes Mr. Novak really.”
…………………….
“Hang on Gabriel actually that letter….” Sam called after the honey blonde as he got into the elevator and pressed the button for the ground floor.
…………………………..
“But we put everything into it Cas, all your savings, the mortgage… I didn’t want you to be disappointed in me. You are smart, you are beautiful, you are kind and funny and endlessly generous. You put everything on the line for me again and again… you gave me my dream, everything I could ever want and couldn’t even be happy.”
“We… We don’t have enough money.”
“And a Garden.” Dean smiled.
It was a good place to rest. The best, he smiled as he settled down and waited for fate to decide whether he should live or die. Either way he knew his life was over and he was going to hell. He had allowed himself to be defiled after all, like the abomination he was. If he was already going to hell maybe suicide wasn’t such a bad idea, he mused. I mean, once you’re damned to hell you can’t damn yourself more, right? Besides, he’d nearly ended up trying it once before so surely, he’d been damned all along. At the time he’d promised himself he’s never do that to Gabriel again, but now Gabriel probably hated him too, wanted rid of him even.
In all honesty he’d just come home for a 20minute lie down. He’d spent all morning at work feeling like crap. The extra hours and juggling two jobs was taking its toll, but they needed the money. It wasn’t forever, he told himself.
“What are you thinking about?” Dean smiled as he slipped a hand across Cas’ shoulders.
“I called, but you didn’t answer.” Cas said, hostility creeping into his voice that made Dean reel a little. Shit. Cas called him all the time and he didn’t answer. He checked his missed calls. Cas hadn’t actually called him in over a week. He’d given up calling.
“But, the fact that they’ve hired Bela tells me that they’re going to be putting up a fight. You have some serious assets between you Dean.”
“Dean?” Cas asked tearfully.
“Sammy…”
Cas sighed. His fiancé was as almost as troubled and self-loathing as he had been when they’d first met. Dean had helped Cas move away from most of his own self-worth issues, but not for lack of trying Cas had been unsuccessful in helping Dean to move past his. “Dean we’ve been through this, it’s not because I don’t love you…” Cas knew he had to be patient with Dean and his insecurities, but today was not a good day for him. The pain was worse than normal and it was grating on his nerves.
“Mr. Novak.” Cas had kept his own name after the marriage. A mutual decision between himself and Dean.
“What are you doing here?” Sam asked curiously.
………………………………………
“Gabriel what are you doing here?” Dean demanded, hiding his worry with anger.
“Bitch.”
(See the end of the chapter for
Cas took a breath and then did so. “I rang up and they said he wasn’t there. That he wasn’t supposed to be working. Actually, they said that for a while now he’s been able to work regular hours, but most nights he doesn’t come home, and I never see him. I have no idea what he has been doing for weeks. When he does come home at night, he’s usually gone before I wake up and he slept as far away from me as he could. He’s never been like that, he’s usually a really clingy sleeper. He used to wake me up with a kiss every morning or sometimes…”
Dean crouches in the grass. There are flowers here.
I am the gentle autumn rain.
“So this is the deal spell —”
But the wind is cold; it bites at Dean’s exposed skin and numbs his hands. Maybe it would be better if he still had a coat on, but thanks to the last, scrabbling attempts to escape by a shapeshifter mid–shifting and drenched in blood, his flannel and jacket were utterly fucked up. He’d stripped them off a while ago, wincing when the gooey bits stuck to his skin, and disposed of them, not realising how cold he’d be later.
“Thank you,” Cas says. There are pleased crinkles around his eyes when he looks at Dean.
He misses … he doesn’t know.
He blinks.
“Uhh,” Dean begins. Words die in his throat. People don’t just snuggle into their friend’s coats. It’s not a normal thing that people do.
He sighs and drops his head into his hands, knuckling his eyes. He wishes he could just get over it already. He wishes his sleep wasn’t tainted with dreams of tearful confessions and bloody handprints and the unforgiving weight of bricks against his back. He wishes… he wishes for Castiel.
He sings along, the familiar tune — all rocking electric guitar and steady snare drum — drawing his face into a grin.
gross,” she said upon seeing Sam’s contact name for Eileen.
“Pass me that coat, would ya, buddy?” he says, gesturing to the navy windbreaker he tossed into the empty backseat earlier that afternoon.
Sam shrugged, and sent his text with a loud
Cas stares at him, a tiny smile tugging at the edges of his confusion. He gives in, eyes almost closed, head tilted a little down, and Dean’s heart just about stops.
Sam turns the book around. “Here,” he says, pointing to a paragraph of densely packed type. Dean squints at it and tries to decipher it but the words go wobbly before he can get a handle on them.
