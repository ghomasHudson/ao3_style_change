“Hey, calm down! I think you’ll be an amazing doctor. That job is made for you!”
He raised his hands towards Cas’ head, before stopping his gesture, uncertain. They looked at each other, the guy trying to probe Cas’ expression, and Cas trying to come to his senses. He’d never seen that boy before; he wasn’t one of Balthazar’s usual friends. Cas dropped the hand that was still on his head, brushing past the boy’s shoulder. That’s when they both realized how close to each other they were standing, and the guy took a step back. He was still looking at Cas.
“What were you watching?” Dean asked, pointing to the TV.
It was Cas’ turn to widen his eyes. “Re-really? You don’t have to… I can…”
Cas rolled his eyes. “Yes, I figured out that much… What are the players allowed to do?”
"But I think I'm going to have to take another bite to
“I will,” Cas nodded softly. “See you next week, Dean."
“Nah, no need to take the bus," Dean said.
Most of the poker players laughed, and April even whistled.
“Okay, Cas, stop, please, stop talking!”.
Trying new things, meeting new people, making a fresh start? What did he mean? The “new people part” was referring to Cas, right? Dean turned back to Cas.
Dean nodded. “Okay, yeah. You’re right.” He glanced at Jack, still lying on the ground. “You’re sure you’ll be fine?”
He stopped, not really knowing where he wanted to go with his sentence. He didn’t even know why he was confessing all of this to Dean; he usually didn’t talk a lot about his feelings, except occasionally with Balthazar.
Dean referred to his car as “her”, and not “it”, which deeply amused Cas. “So you can give me a ride?” he asked for confirmation.
“Okay, your turn, Balthazar," said one of the players.
“But you did it, in the end. Better late than never. Besides, it’s not even late. Everyone goes at their own pace. For me it’s easy, because I’m used to it. I don’t deserve any credit for doing what I can do easily! But for you, it’s more complicated, because you’re an introvert. But you decided to do it anyway. That makes your commitment to the program even more meaningful!”
Dean, smirking, announced, "Raise!” And he put six chips on the table.
Cas opened the door. Indeed, Dean was parked just in front of his doorway, driving a beautiful old black car. His window was open, and he was resting one of his elbows on it, while his other hand was casually holding the wheel. He looked so cool. He smiled widely when he noticed Cas, waving two fingers at him to greet him.
“Okay, Cas. Well, feel free to get in touch with me if you have any questions about the society or the LGBT+ community in general. I hope to see you next Sunday! 4 pm, student union building.”
Turned out that, in fact, Cas was delighted with his presents: cooking tools, a cooking book, two pairs of funny socks with Christmas patterns on them, candy canes and gingerbread men, and an apron, so that Cas doesn’t get dirty anymore when he cooks. Everything was fine, until suddenly Cas froze, looking panicked.
“Or…” Cas began, uncertain, “Since he shouldn’t be very long…”
« It’s never too late. We can figuring it out. I know we can. I had no idea you were feeling all of this… Now, I understand you. I know we can fix this, but Dean, you have to have faith in me. You have to trust me. You have to trust me when I say I love you, you have to trust me when I say you deserve to be loved. And you need to keep talking to me… Please Dean, I’m willing to try, to do everything that I can, but I can’t do it alone… You have to work with me, here… Please, Dean ? »
“It depends. Usually, at regular meetings like this, we have between 15 and 20 participants. But sometimes we organize specific events, and we can have way more students, 50, 60…”
“About her?” Cas repeated, confused.
The guy smiled.
“Because it was mainly about you, and I knew it was something I had to figure out myself, and I wanted to be sure, before coming to you with it, and…”
“We never talked about a reward?” Cas asked, uncertain.
It was really interesting, listening to the other students. No one had the same backstory: they all had different experiences, different personalities… But in the end, an overall feeling of acceptance permeated Cas. Even though no student mentioned being asexual, the way one of the girls described being aromantic was, overall, quite similar to how Cas was feeling. He had never had a problem with his homosexuality, always had accepted it as a fact, a part of who he was, and therefore never felt the need to talk about it. However, Cas enjoyed hearing about other gay students’ experiences, about coming out stories, about having their first homosexual relationship, more than he thought he would. Beyond the specific topic of asexuality, this was a safe space to talk in general.
“Oh yeah? And what about that new boyfriend of yours, the athlete?” Cas suddenly snapped.
“Well, I guess that people change, you were not the kind of girl who stuck with the same guy for more than three dates, and here you are, the official girlfriend of Dean’s roommate!”
“So I tried to talk to people on the app, but it didn’t really help me. Some of them even texted me about having sex directly, but t wasn’t something I was interested in at all. Even if they were good-looking.”
“What?”
“Oh no, that’s very nice of you but I think I’m just gonna make a sandwich.”
“Why did you come? What are you doing here? What were you doing back there? When did you… What did you hear? Did you…”
Dean gave him a questioning look, encouraging him to develop his idea.
yesterday. I sent you a message this morning! But you didn't answer me, maybe you haven't logged on to the app yet, today?"
Cas anxiously looked around him before carefully stepping into the room. “Hello,” he said.
“No-Not at all,” Cas answered, quickly and defensively, feeling his cheeks turning red from embarrassment.
However, what Dean noticed was not the "Hey Dean, how is it going? Nice car on your profile pic ;) " that Tom had sent him... But the conversation just below his.
“Oh yes, there you are Dean, I was sure it was your car. You came to bring my poker case, I guess? Sorry I wasn’t home when you arrived, I…”
“Good,” Cas said. He went to the doorway, staying there watching Dean run to his car, open the door, and lean in to retrieve the case. Cas had a perfect view of the guy’s butt, and he couldn’t help but think about what Meg had said a few days before: “
"Good night," Dean muttered as he headed for his room.
“Bet.” Balthazar said.
Cas stared at him for a few minutes, considering what Dean just said, before asking for a confirmation: “So… that means that you…that you reciprocate my feelings?”
“Fair enough,” Meg admitted.
After grabbing his plate - a pasta salad, which he judged he could eat without reheating it - he awkwardly sat down on the table facing Cas, who was still silently scrutinizing him. After two bites, Dean finally put his fork down.
“Jack,” the kid answered, a little bit shyly.
“Fine, as long as you call me Cas."
“And, by the way, later doesn’t have to be today. My offer still stands for another time, if you ever want some private lessons. It would be a shame for you to miss out on what a great game poker is!”
“So what, you could be in a relationship with him and never have sex with him?”
Dean took longer to reply, this time. Cas was starting to wonder why, when his phone buzzed.
“Good morning,” his roommate said, “I made extra eggs, if you want.”
Dean frowned. “What?”
Dean raised an eyebrow. “Really? You didn’t seem that pleased, inside that bar, two minutes ago.”
“Yeah, yeah, I’m fine.”
Dean nodded and quickly glanced around the room, looking for a free chair.
“What kind of tea do you recommend, Cas?”
“I’d like to hug him, to hold his hand. Maybe kiss him, yes. But… nothing more.”
“The music? The people talking? Are you at a bar? Dean, what are you doing? Where is Cas??”
A dozen students were now in the room. Cas looked carefully at their clothes. His outfit didn’t stand out from the others, which reassured him. He sat down, took the notebook out of his pocket and opened it, absent-mindedly doodling while waiting for the meeting to begin.
“But you and I both know that you can also be more ruffled in other circumstances, especially at night," he whispered.
“Dean,” Cas sighed. “You heard me, earlier, didn’t you? The… The speech I gave… It wasn’t to declare my undying love for you, not initially, at least… It was to share my experience about… It hurts me to say it, it hurts me even more knowing that you like me back, but… I don’t think we want the same things in a relationship… I’m not against having… Having sex, but… I don’t picture it, right now. If I had to have sex, it would be with you, but, it’s not something I feel ready to do now… I don’t feel the need to. And… You’re beautiful, really, I could stay here and stare at you for hours and hours, but… There’s nothing… There’s nothing sexual in how I feel about you. And I know sex is very important for you, and it would be very selfish of me to keep you from having sex again, since it’s clearly something you enjoy and…”
He always thought that “sexual attraction” was a social construction; that when people  said “wow, that person is so hot, I’d like to have sex with them,” they didn’t really mean it, that it was just a thing people said without questioning it, an unspoken social rule. He himself had agreed with friends that “yes, Ryan Gosling is super sexy,” even though he didn’t know why the fact that he was shirtless in one picture changed his level of aesthetic attractiveness. For Castiel, it didn’t make any difference; what mattered was the color of his eyes, his haircut, the harmony of his facial features. Now, he was curious to know whether it was just him, or if other people felt that way, too. He was overall very confused about this asexuality thing: he had always just assumed that everyone thought like him, and suddenly discovering that no, once again, he was different from the others, was kind of scary. So maybe talking to other people about it could help him? But he wasn’t even considering going to one of the Sunday meetings of the society. The idea seemed ridiculous with his anxiety. He could never do that. Maybe he could just go back on social media to read about the experiences of other asexuals. That would be better than nothing, and less stressful for him.
It actually made more sense to see her there than Charlie. She was Benny’s girlfriend, after all. She was holding two beers, and she gave one to her boyfriend, sitting next to him.
“Hey, Dean, it’s fine! You don’t have to put a label on what you’re experiencing. I’m… Really surprised to hear that you might be on the asexuality spectrum. And whether you’re ace or not, it’s okay. It doesn’t freak me out, because I knew it from the start… I thought the only thing you wanted would be to be friends with benefits, that’s why I thought we couldn’t be together…”
« You always had been », simply answered Cas.
Dean smiled. “He’s a mechanic, owns his garage, and for years I thought I’d go to work with him at the shop after high school. But… My mother, she would have wanted me to go to college. To try, at least. It wasn’t an easy choice. I didn’t want to disappoint my father, you know.”
“You could have just joined us in the living room when the pizza arrived. I texted you! This is still your place, I promise you that my friends won’t bite. Except for Dean maybe. I’m sorry you met him first, I hope he won’t scare you off!” he joked, winking at Dean who looked scandalized.
“A-? And I only got a C+? But we compared our homework before handing them in!” Meg protested, grabbing Cas’ assignment before he could even take a look at it.
Unfortunately, Cas was waiting for him, sitting in a chair, arms crossed, his plate already cleared and put away.
“Wow, really? Lucky you!”
And then, he remembered that an hour before, Dean had called him “buddy.” Cas almost sighed, confused. He was getting mixed signals here!
The woman smiled cheerfully, stepping back. “Be my guest!”
“Wow, really?” Claire asked. “That’s impressive!”
"I'm glad to see that you're enjoying the situation," he replied curtly.
“Okay, then a chai latte and a black tea with milk and sugar, please,” Dean ordered.
Cas immediately stopped and carefully looked at Dean. He didn’t seem angry. Dean smiled a little, seeing how Cas’s face was covered in dough.
“What is that supposed to mean?” Dean barked immediately.
Cas nodded as he grabbed the remote and switched on the TV, launching Netflix. Dean had said to surprise him, while being a movie fan? He didn't know much about movies - he didn't watch TV that often. But Dean also said to choose something he liked. And to surprise him. With a smirk on his face, Cas selected the "documentaries" category, remembering their earlier conversation about animal documentaries.
There was some noise in the hallway. Dean glanced out the door and then at his watch.
Dean grinned before finally showing his cards. “It seems that I have more than one ace to play! Aces full, three aces and a pair of queens!”
“But I don’t understand: you admitted you were attracted to him! So why don’t you want to take what he has to offer, even if it’s just for one night or two? Still better than nothing. You could have some fun, sexy times with him and then forget about him if you want! No pressure, no strings attached, no feelings. That’s perfect!”
Cas’ guts twisted. No. It couldn’t be possible. He refused to believe he understood what she meant. She was probably talking about someone else. There was no way that…
“Nah, that’s good, let’s just hope the common kitchen will be free Friday evening!”
“Nah, I’m fine, I left just after you and Balthazar.”
Without noticing it, Cas found himself walking to Café-in. Dean said he often went there. Maybe he would see him?
However, while the idea had seemed very good when he had thought of it, now that it was the time to say it out loud in front of Dean, he was much less sure of himself.
« Isn’t it too late ? »
Donna was now explaining the logistics of volunteering.
Cas nodded. He actually knew a lot about not wanting to disappoint one’s father… He had had the same struggles. Still had them. Dean kept going, and Cas never imagined that he would be the kind of guy to open up so easily, especially about personal things like this.
, to perfect strangers, but he guessed that his friend probably had been very confused and overwhelmed.
“I’m fine.”
Cas blushed a little. “For example, there are parts of what people do in a relationship - in a romantic relationship - that I know I would like to do with you, but others that I’m not really sure of.”
Dean almost choked. So Cas did go on a date? But when? How could he and Sam have not noticed Cas leaving the bunker for a few hours? And most importantly, did that guy try to convince Cas to have sex with him? Did he touch him? Hurt him? Threaten him?
Jody rolled her eyes and Cas was surprised enough to make an amused little sound. Usually, he was quite oblivious to that kind of humor.
“Me too. Thank you, Dean,” Cas smiled softly.
Three dots next to Cas’ name indicated he was still typing :
Cas had no idea what was going on. Balthazar, once again, was the first one to play and chose to bet five chips this time. Lisa growled but followed him.
“Cas…”
“Okay, so now, Cas… If you really want to be a doctor, there is still something you have to do!”
“Okay, boys, I think the next pair is waiting behind you to choose their groups. If you don’t have any more questions, you’re free to go now. Castiel, if you have questions, feel free to contact me or Donna." Jody grabbed a leaflet from a pile of papers that was on her table. Both Jody and Donna's contact information was written down, as well as some practical information.
“Sorry about that.”
“What time is he coming for?”
Sam squinted his eyes, opened his mouth to say something but changed his mind at the last moment. He must have realized that this was not the time.
And, despite all odds, Cas found it bothered him a little that their watching sessions kept being strictly platonic. Strictly friendly. He didn’t want to have sex with Dean, but he was craving some romantic interaction with him – he wanted to lean his head on his shoulder, curl up sharing a blanket with him, hold his hand, hug him, see him every day… What what they had, no matter how great and amazing it was, soon became not enough. However, it was very clear to Cas that if Dean, the flirtiest guy on the campus, hadn’t made a move yet, it meant he was not interested in him that way. Cas was perfectly aware of it, and he had known it from the beginning, but it still hurt him to experience it and to think about it. Maybe he could have some casual sex with him, if he asked him, given what Dean told him at the party at the bar a few weeks earlier. Dean had told him he was hot. However, casual sex wasn’t what Cas was looking for. He wanted more, so much more! He didn’t want to just have sex with Dean, he wanted it to have meaning. For both of them.
“Good. That’s all I’m asking from you for now. I’m Charlie, by the way, Charlie Bradbury, president of the society.”
Dean almost burst out laughing. Cas gave him a scandalous look. “Please, Dean, don’t laugh at me. You said I could talk to you, and-”
His tone was unsure, as if he was still discovering things about himself as he was talking.
“Okay,” Dean said, still very gently. “Take your time. And don’t worry, okay? Everything is fine. It’s alright.”
Jody beamed. “I will! Cas, Dean, goodbye!”
Dean frowned.
Cas knew that he would need to thank Charlie, and probably apologize to her and the other students for running away. He knew he would have to practice poker with Dean during the week if he really wanted to go with him to the poker tournament. He would have to announce it to Meg, too. And it was getting late, and he needed to prepare his bag for the next day, and… He had a lot of things to think about, a lot of things to worry about. However, at that moment, the rest of his life didn’t really matter. He was just enjoying the moment – he would have all the time to deal with the rest of the world later. And besides, he knew Dean would be with him all along the way.
Cas thought. He blushed slightly at the idea.
Embarrassed, Cas squirmed in his chair. Luckily – and quite unexpectedly, coming from her – Meg saved him.
“That’s how it began, yes. Now something more is slowly developing, but we began with sex.”
“Don’t you agree, Castiel?”
After a few minutes of banging and shouting, he finally gave up, falling to his knees as he began to cry.
“So what, you’re jealous, Cas?” Dean smirked.
Dean was just so kind. Cas’ heart was melting. Even though he should have been the sad one, he was still thinking about Cas, trying to make him feel better, even though the whole situation has been triggered by Cas’ stupid question in the first place.
“How are you feeling? Is your head okay?”
Dean seemed to remember he didn’t come alone. “Oh yes, right, this is Cassie. Cassie, meet Meg, and Cas… Apparently, the name “Cas” is an indicator of beauty,” he joked, winking.
Cas choked on his drink and spat out some tea. Meg burst into laughter.
They stared at each other for a few minutes. It had stopped raining, but Cas’ clothes were completely wet. He shivered.
“What were you doing with Dean Winchester?” Balthazar exclaimed, as he got up on the couch, his interest piqued. “You know him?”
“Nice polo shirt. Looks good on you,” Dean commented.
Dean raised an eyebrow. He still didn’t understand why Cas would have talked about this, and about
. He just wanted to share his point of view about documentaries, and he was so focused on his arguments that he didn’t think anymore about what Dean would think of him. He was just himself.
And Dean wasn’t answering. Of course he wasn’t. He was probably too busy laughing at that text, or worse, analyzing it to understand why Cas wrote that. He was probably trying to find a way to say politely that Cas wasn’t his mother and should mind his own business. Cas was mortified. He would be so embarrassed the next day, there’s no way he would be able to look at Dean after sending that text! He switched off the TV, not in the mood to watch it anymore. He was going to go to bed and to hide himself under his pillow until the next day, hoping Dean would forget his text in the meantime, and…
Cas burst out laughing.
“I think Cas and I would make a great team,” Dean said, just like that, as if he was stating something obvious. Cas gave him a puzzled look. “I have experience in the program and he’s new so I could teach him how it works. And we’re from the two different groups, so it looks like we’re a match."
“Yes,” Cas confirmed, “It’s just a scratch. Jack was quite scared and cried a little, but his knee is fine.”
“Oh,” Dean said again.
“Uh, yes, I think so…”
“Cas? What are you doing here? Wait… You know Dean?” said someone who was hidden behind Benny. The voice sounded familiar to Cas, but he couldn’t exactly identify who it was.
Cas finally found enough willpower to unlock himself from Dean’s gaze to actually get out of the car, and he quickly closed the door to not be tempted to stare at Dean longer. Dean started the car, and Cas waved at him, even though Dean couldn’t see him in the dark.
“Or, you could…” Cas started, spontaneously, then stopped realizing what he was about to suggest.
Dean was looking at him very intensely, as if he was trying to convince Cas with his eyes. He seemed to truly believe what he was saying. Cas lowered his eyes, unable to hold Dean’s gaze any longer, smiling a little sadly.
“So, I’ll see you tomorrow, I’ll pick you up at 1 like usual?”
“Come on, Wednesday is in four days! Live, Cas!”
Without wanting to, Cas frowned lightly in disappointment.
The mother nodded, apparently relieved; Cas waved at her, and went through the emergency information he needed from her. He was feeling good: dealing with the parents and the paperwork, looking serious and professional, that he could do. And meanwhile, Dean seemed to be doing great with the shy Jack. Soon, other children joined them, Dean welcoming them and sending the parents to Cas. Once all ten kids were there, Dean clapped his hands to get everyone’s attention.
was really there. He closed his eyes, trying to breathe. Charlie stopped talking. The other students that Cas still couldn’t see, were completely silent, holding their breaths, starting to understand what was going on. Cas’ thoughts were racing in his brain, and he couldn’t think clearly anymore. His brain and body turned into “panic” mode. Denial, denial was the best solution. If he didn’t turn around, he wouldn’t see him, and he could still pretend he didn’t know he had heard him… He was about to suggest the idea to Charlie, where he heard it.
. Did Balthazar also know about Cas' asexuality? There was no way he knew about it, Cas never mentioned it. But his roommate and childhood friend knew him well enough to be able to say that indeed, Cas wasn’t the kind of guy to flirt and try to hook up with everyone at parties. Though, now that he’d gotten to know Dean better, Cas wasn’t so sure that Dean was that kind of guy either. Sure, he had a reputation. Meg and Balthazar both told him about it. And sure, he was a flirty person, who liked to wink. And sure, Cas saw him with Jo the barista, with Cassie at Café-in, even with the girl called Lisa at the first poker night. But he never actually saw him kissing any of those girls, for example.
Cas never really showed any interest in dating, even when Dean tried to encourage him – giving him advice, offering to go out with him to bars, even starting a conversation with a cute girl to introduce Cas to her. Well, at least, he used to encourage him. That was when Dean himself used to go out, to flirt and hook up a lot. Though, when he thought about it, he had to admit he hadn’t done that for a few months. Not since they found the bunker, actually. Now, Dean had a place to go home even when he was going out, and it was not as if he could bring anyone back to the bunker. Before, after a hunt, Dean liked to stay one or two days and nights in the town he worked in, just to relax a little, get drunk, and maybe, if he was lucky and in the mood for it, find a sexy girl to spend the night with. Now, when he was done with a hunt, he liked to hurry up to go back to the bunker, to get back to his kitchen, his room, his bed.
Yet, Cas had been the one to create a profile on the dating app. Cas had been the one swiping right on Tom’s profile. Cas had been the one sending and answering messages. Cas was a grown-up, if he wanted to go on a date with the guy, Dean had no right to forbid him. Especially not by passing off his jealousy as a protective impulse.
“Hello?” a woman with brown hair asked. A little boy was hiding behind her.
Automatically, Cas raised his hand to feel his skull.
It seemed to be an argument they had regularly.
“Oh, yes, I’m sorry Balt, I completely forgot about your poker evening!”
He combed his hair, but it would probably still be a little bit wet when he went outside, and therefore would probably become slightly tangled, as it often did. He used to hate it, but now he didn’t care anymore. It was just a part of him, and probably the only thing he couldn’t control – aside from his thoughts. Even though he was always clean-shaven and had impeccably pressed shirts, he still had a few strands of rebellious hair left, to remind him that, no matter how hard he tried, he couldn’t be perfect.
Cas tried to not blush.
“Good idea,” Dean agreed. “But I don’t need much.”
“Cas,” Dean nodded at him.
“Oh, really?” Cas asked, curious.
“Hi everyone, as Charlie said, I prepared a slide show about sexual orientations. You are my test audience, but ultimately, the goal is to use it to educate all students, not only the members of our society who are already pretty familiar with the different sexual identities, but also the other regular students, who don’t know much about the LGBT+ community. And for next week, I am preparing the same kind of presentation, but about gender identity. So, let’s start…”
Jack nodded.
Cas stepped even further away from Dean, shaking his head. “No, no, of course not. I was actually going back to my room. I’ll let you talk about poker. See you tomorrow, Dean?”
“Yes, I received your email! Welcome to the team, Castiel. I’m sure you’ll find lots of ways to involve yourself in the community with the CLCP!”
“I don’t really know, what did you do last year?”
Sam was the only explanation. But why didn’t he tell Dean about it? For a minute, Dean considered asking him. Then he remembered he couldn’t, because telling Sam he saw Cas on the dating app would force him to reveal he was himself on the dating app – and was looking at male profiles. Which led Dean to gasp one more time: it meant that Cas himself had set his profile to see male profiles. Cas was interested in men. Was Cas gay? Or bisexual? Dean tried to think about every time he saw Cas interacting with men, looking for hints of him being gay. Why didn’t Dean notice it? Why didn’t Cas tell them?
“What time did you say you were leaving tonight?”
“Oh yes, about that, sorry but tomorrow evening I’m going out with Charlie and some of her friends. Sunday evening, maybe, if that’s ok with you?”
"You're not?" Cas asked, astonished. He had expected Dean to try to meet his friends from the poker circle later in the evening, to at least play a game or two with them.
“Wait, Dean, I’m going outside. If you’re talking, I can’t hear you,” Cas said as he opened the door.
“Okay, we’re only waiting for two more parents now, and then we’ll be alone again, free of children.”
A group of children had circled one of the kids who was lying down on the floor, crying loudly. Cas turned to ask Dean what had happened, but Dean was already kneeling next to the child.
“Six pm, but he’ll probably have to stay for a few hours. Why? Is there a problem?”
“I’m not laughing at you, Cas,” Dean said, more seriously. “Really, I’m not. It’s just that… It’s ridiculous. Sex isn’t what make us humans! There are a lot of humans who never have sex, or who don’t like it, or don’t want it. I assure you that you’re not alone. There is nothing wrong with you, Cas. I’m not gonna lie to you, hooking up is fun, but believe me, it’s not the only thing in the world. There are things that matter more. And the older I get, the more I understand that. When’s the last time you saw me hook up with some random chick in a bar?”
Cas didn’t know what to answer. He could feel that his cheeks were red – was it because of Dean’s proximity, because of how aware he was of Dean’s warm hands on his shoulders? Was it because of the compliment? – and his head was spinning a little. So he didn’t answer, and kept staring at Dean instead. For both of them, it was enough. After a while, Dean finally let go and took a step away.
"Let's do it," Dean smiled.
Cas grunted. Way to kill the light-hearted mood, once again! Bringing out his insecurities… Dean would really think he was too annoying and too much trouble. He wasn’t his therapist! And was probably not expecting having to comfort a guy he barely knew at eleven o’clock on a Friday evening…
“I’ll see Dean next week, by the way, we have a poker night,” Balthazar said when he heard Cas coming in the kitchen the next day.
How could Cas recognize and identify “flirtation” anyway? He never flirted with anyone and no one ever flirted with him. He was 20 and he had never flirted with anyone. He was 20 and had never been in a relationship. He had known pretty early he was gay; it never had been a problem for him. He couldn’t have fought it, anyway. Even if he had never had a boyfriend, he had felt romantic attraction for lots of boys, before. He had never really told anyone, though. He assumed that Balthazar had probably guessed by now. He was himself openly bisexual and had brought a lot of his conquests to their apartment since they had been living together. However, as Cas had never been in a relationship, he never felt the need to “come out.” He couldn’t see what good coming out would do: he wasn’t sure of what his parents’ reactions would be. It wasn’t something he had to do right now. He was just keeping it to himself, having secret crushes on boys he found adorable.
“It’s okay, we can walk. If we’re too cold, I have some ideas on how we can warm up once we’re at your place…” Lisa assured.
“Um… Did you need something?”
Cas paused for a minute, unsure of what he was going to answer.
On the Friday morning, Balthazar was making breakfast in the kitchen when Cas woke up.
“I had the 8 to 10-year old group, and it was really great. They're at an interesting age, not too young so not too whiny, but not too old so not too annoying – really, two years ago I had the pre-teen group and it was a nightmare!”
“What you have?” Cas frowned.
“That’s nice. I hope you’ll have a good time."
“I’m sure he’ll be an amazing doctor,” Jack’s mother answered. “He’s really caring and soft with children! Anyway, we have to go, now, Jack has an appointment for a haircut in 15 minutes… See you next week!”
“Are they in a relationship?” Balthazar interrupted.
Meg smirked, pleased that Cas got caught in the conversation and didn’t deny it again.
Cas was stunned by Dean’s ability to speak so freely to this entire group of parents. He was very charismatic because everyone was carefully listening to him – so it wasn’t just Cas who found him amazing: objectively other people seemed to like him, too.
Cas barely knew him, so if from the start he embraced the idea that they would never be more than friends, then a friendship would be possible. Locking away the possibility of a romantic relationship from the beginning would save him from having to suffer later, once he would have become attached to Dean and would have had higher hopes. The fall would be painful. But he was going to stop himself. Dean seemed to be the kind of person that was easy to love - and Cas could completely imagine falling in love with him quickly, especially if they spent at least two hours together every week.
“Okay, Benny texted me, my friends are already here, and they saved seats for us. That’s good, because I think we're gonna be right on time,” he said, looking at his watch.
“Actually…Not today. Today I feel like trying new things, meeting new people, making a fresh start…”
“There ain’t much  left over. Too bad!” Dean commented.
“Yes, he can be a little over-dramatic sometimes, you know how kids are… Thanks for taking care of him!”
“Yes, my cousin told me something like that happened to his neighbor. He was in a car accident, and it was so bad that the doctors had to cut off his entire leg!”
They wanted two different things, and Cas was very frustrated about it, because he was also sure that there was something between them. They enjoyed themselves so much, they had such a good connection! He sometimes wished he could just be like everyone else and be happy with the idea of a friend-with-benefits situation, which would satisfy both of them.
On the ride back to campus, they talked about the next activities they would propose to the children, and Cas didn’t get to bring back the “is being a doctor my true vocation” topic. Maybe it was for the best. He was already falling hard for Dean, and he didn’t necessarily need another moment of intense connection between the two of them to fuel his unrequited crush.
He knew Meg liked parties and social events and flirting – she liked to tease him about it and to embarrass him with details about her love life – but she didn’t really “date". She wasn’t trying to get into a romantic relationship; in two years, she had had three different friends with benefits, and she liked flirting at parties, but it never really went beyond those lines with anyone. He was surprised she had brought it up. And he was even more surprised when Meg’s cheeks turned pink.
Cas wiped his eyes with an angry gesture; he hadn't really cried, but tears had formed at the corners of his eyes. Why did he want to cry? Why did he feel so sad? He wanted to be angry, not sad!
Cas shook his head. “No, it’s fine, I was just grabbing a snack before going back to my room.”
Cas stared at the contents of his wardrobe, uncertain. What should he wear? Definitely not a formal shirt – he was going to meet the children in his group, not attend a seminar! But he would also probably see the parents, and he needed to look like he was serious and could be trusted with their kids. Once again, he knew it wasn’t such a big decision. Yet, he couldn’t decide.
“Hey, let’s go inside, okay?” Dean murmured softly.
He wrapped the gifts he bought, and placed them under the branches of pines he arranged. He added the tinsels and the ornaments he got in the convenience store. It didn’t look good, but it was better than nothing. Then he quickly went to the kitchen and noticed the ingredients for making the cookies were still there: Cas didn’t bake without him when he left. Dean cooked some pancakes and hot chocolate, put on one of the Christmas sweaters, let his phone in the main room playing some Christmas songs. It was SO cliché. He finally grabbed the other sweater and a cup of hot chocolate, and knocked at Cas’s door. He was so busy preparing everything that he didn’t even think about what he was going to say, and got caught off guard when Cas opened the door, facing him.
"Uh... Well, well, well,” he began, hesitantly, testing the waters. “There is something... But I'm not sure if we have enough time to do it in 20 minutes..."
Should Cas try to wink to make him understand he was joking? Like the way Dean was always winking at him? He tried to, but he only blinked. But Dean was smiling, and Cas took it for a sign that he’d understood the joke. He felt pleased.
“I would personally not say no, if he needs any instructor in that matter”, Tom continued. “I bet we could…”
“A pie baking workshop? I think I’m gonna like you, Cas!” Dean commented. “Great idea. I’m totally on board with it!”
Jack nodded enthusiastically, and followed Cas to the kitchen, while Dean was welcoming the parents and saying goodbye to the first kids who were leaving.
He was glad to go to the next meeting of the LGBT+ society, the next day. These days, he was questioning himself more and more about his sexuality. He was realizing, even though he wasn’t really surprised, that falling in love with Dean hadn’t changed the kind of attraction he was experiencing, which meant that apparently he wasn’t demisexual. That being said, he wasn’t in a real relationship with Dean. They were close emotionally, but not physically. But of course, they would never be more than that, so Cas would never find out how his attraction would change in the context of a relationship. Not with Dean, at least. Which was fine. He knew it from the beginning. And they were definitely not going on a date next Friday. Of course not.
“But…” Cas bit his lips. He needed to be a grown-up and to break the ice, even though it terrified him. “Why?”
“Sorry, I…”
Usually, when he was talking to Dean, even though he loved it, Cas felt a little bit nervous at the beginning. He was afraid of saying something wrong, of looking ridiculous, or boring. But usually, after a few moments, Dean’s warm smile and confident gaze helped him relax and feel better, and he could progressively stop worrying about every word he was saying.
Oh. Little by little, Dean was starting to gather the pieces of the puzzle.
“I know, but we also decided that when I had people over, I would clean before and after myself, especially if you don’t join us… Not that you can’t, of course, you know you’re free to hang out with us if you want, but…”
“It can be anything, really,” Charlie encouraged him. “A thought you’ve had for a long time, something that happened during the week, a story you heard, a question you have…”
However, it was not a date, it was just a casual meeting between two volunteers. It was almost a professional situation. He had to be careful to keep that in mind.
“What do you mean, someone like you? We’re not cool enough for you? Don’t forget you’re as much of a nerd as me!”
, Dean had added. However, Cas was a grown-up twenty-year old. He could decide what clothes he was going to wear by himself; maybe he could just check what Dean was wearing when he came to pick him up at one and quickly change if needed. Yes, that sounded like a good plan. Dean would tell him if he was over (or under) dressed.
“Well, I saw the expression on your face, and I took pity on you. I’ve been stuck with Raphael before. I know how dull that dude can be.”
He got out of the car, awkwardly waved at Dean, and watched his car restart and disappear around the corner of the street. With a smile still on his face, he entered the house where he was greeted by Balthazar, who was lazily watching TV in the living room.
“Well, at least, he has interesting conversation topics,” he answered.
“Balthazar isn’t here?”
Dean let out a laugh, and Cas felt a flash of anger overwhelm him.
“No… No worries, I’m still half asleep, it’s not your fault.”
“Thank you."
Cas glanced down at his outfit. There was nothing out of the ordinary about it. He wondered if Dean was teasing, but he looked pretty serious – as much as Dean could be serious. As if he was really complimenting him. Cas looked up, uncertain.
She walked away with a perky step, and Cas watched her disappear around the corner, and then shifted his attention back to the poster. Quickly, he pulled out his phone to take a picture of the information about the meeting hours. It didn't commit him to anything, after all.
“Nothing,” Cas answered. But he kept smiling.
“I don’t know, but like… The way you are with the children. You’re so caring, looking after them, being patient, thoughtful, kind… And even in general, I don’t know you that well yet, but… You always want to do things the best that you can, and make things right… I can totally picture you as a doctor, helping people. Children, maybe? Did you already think about a medical specialty?”
« The most important is that you know we are real. ».
« And I do even better. I trust us. And everything will be alright, as long as we have us ».
“Raise," Dean said, putting more chips than Balthazar.
Three dates with the same guy? That definitely didn't sound like Meg. Cas smiled, amused. He hesitated to tease her a little about it – she herself had teased him enough over two years of friendship to deserve a little payback! - but she seemed quite serious and insecure, which was in stark contrast to her usual behaviour, and he was touched that she had told him about it. If she had, it was because it was important to her, and she trusted him enough to bring it up. He didn't want to rush her. Maybe she was just testing the waters because she didn't know if she could open up about it with him.
He did some quick research on the Internet about basketball beforehand, to not look like a complete fool in front of Dean’s friends, but at least he had an excuse: Dean knew he wasn’t familiar with basketball, and wasn’t expecting him to be an expert on the topic anyway.
“That’s what I do when I wake up and can’t go back to sleep”, Cas insisted. “It usually helps”, he says, pointing at the cup in front of him, on the table.
“I know, Balt, I know…” he simply sighed.
“Castiel, I’m afraid that you’ll have an additional child in your group," the sheriff joked.
“Yup, seems I haven’t calmed down.”
It was what they had planned, after all. But Dean was feeling too guilty for it. He didn’t have the courage and the energy to stay with the angel. He didn’t deserve to spend time with him.
He had not expected that his little excursion to get a snack would lead him to this scene. He had been still sleepy, not in a social mood at all, wearing clothes that could pass for pajamas, in short, in the worst conditions under which to be social and meet someone and talk to them, but against all odds, he had greatly appreciated it. Everything happened so fast, and he didn’t really realize what was going on, but now that he had some quiet alone time to think about it…He couldn’t stop thinking about that guy. Dean. He had caught him at a very unexpected time, and usually, in those circumstances, Cas wouldn’t even have paid attention to him, focused on getting back to his room. But he had felt like Dean was different.
“Dean! We’re gonna start the next game, you coming? And Lisa asked if you found those beers in the fridge?”
“Not recently,” Dean admitted. “But still… I remembered seeing some clips on TV when I was a kid, and it was always the same… lions running in the savanna hunting antelopes… Boring!”
Dean took a look at the drink, stirring the cup a little. “I’m sure I will if you love it. I trust your judgment,” he said, leaning in a little.
“What? You think that’s possible?”
A little warning, there is a description of a panic attack at the beginning of the chapter.
He opened his arms to display his outfit, feeling ridiculous for doing it. Dean slowly turned and he saw Dean’s eyes quickly scanning his body. For a few seconds, he said nothing, and Cas felt himself flushing lightly. That was awkward. Why did he ask that? Dean nervously wetted his lips and nodded.
“It’s short for Children of Lawrence Community Program. Don’t worry, I’ll explain all the details when the meeting starts. You can sit if you want, we’re waiting another five minutes and then we’ll start. Thanks again!”
His team won – even though he didn’t really care about the results, and neither did the children, since they all got to eat Dean’s cookies. After all the children left, Dean and Cas began to do the dishes, debriefing on the activity and deciding what they would organize the next week.
Dean raised an eyebrow – clearly, he hadn’t been expecting that. “You’re full of surprises… And that’s why I love you,” he said, leaning in to kiss him.
“Dean, that’s not about you! It’s about Cas! The most important is that he’s happy! And if you can be happy at the same time, it’s even better! You need to talk to him, Dean, the two of you are just miserable separately when you could be so happy together!”
Cas’ heart lightened. Dean was definitely the personification of kindness.
Dean laughed, but not in a mean way. “Come on, Cas, really? Animal documentaries? How old are you?”
“Hey, man! You wanna play pool with us?” a man suddenly asked him, pulling him out of his thoughts.
He had chosen to wear a white polo shirt with a blue jacket and blue jeans, to look as casual as he could. By 6:15, he was already pacing in the living room. He heard Dean’s Impala parking in front of his place before Dean could even text him – though, he waited for Dean’s text before coming out. Dean didn’t text, though. Instead, he got out of the car and rang the doorbell. Usually, he just waited in his car, but Cas wasn’t complaining. It made him feel as if it was a real date, which was pretty pleasant, even though it wasn’t. Before opening the door, he briefly closed his eyes and repeated, one last time “Not a date, not a date, not a date. Don’t get your hopes too high, Cas. This is not a date.”
“Okay, come here, I’m gonna show you what I planned to do for today…”
“Well sorry about that, man. I don’t know why I told you all that, out of the blue like I did. Talking about my feelings isn’t something I usually do,” he laughed to hide his embarrassment. “Hell, I have a reputation to uphold!”
He’d known for a while that he was attracted to men, but he had always buried it, ignored it, mainly because he was afraid. Afraid of what others would think, afraid of trying and liking it, afraid of being ridiculous by flirting with a guy that, in fact, was straight. The relative anonymity and distance induced by the virtuality of the dating app felt reassuring. He could explore this attraction he was feeling, chat with some guys, and see how it would feel without involving himself too much or worrying what others would think. No one he knew would know he was on this app, let alone that he was looking for both women and men. Or, at least, that was what he had thought.
"Well," he resumed, trying to appear confident and relaxed (the opposite of his current state of mind and of his personality in general). "About that... I had thought that maybe you could combine the two... Can you come with me into the living room?"
“I can try,” Jack said, sniffing – and Cas noticed that at least he stopped crying.
And he retreated to his room before giving either one of them the opportunity to tell him he could stay with them. He needed to be alone for a few moments to process what had just happened. He and Dean had shared a moment. Well, they often did, but this time, it was even more profound than usual. Cas couldn’t help but wonder what could have happened if Balthazar hadn’t interrupted them. On one hand, he actually wouldn’t have known how to answer Dean after his “I do trust you,” and even though the situation and the staring that had followed had been comfortable, it could have become awkward if Dean had been expecting Cas to say something. On the other hand, Cas really appreciated their conversation, and he would have liked to follow up on that question. He had been worried about his future, and his ability to become a doctor for a while, but never really dared to talk about it out loud to anyone.
Cas grinned.
“I’m sorry, Dean. I know you don’t want to celebrate Christmas, but… I thought that you’d stay in your room and that you wouldn’t see me…”.
Dean raised his hands as a sign of appeasement. "Okay, okay, I was kidding. I'm really glad I get to watch it. "Our Planet" has been on my list for several weeks! You recommended it, by the way, I think!"
Ben laughed, as if Cas just said something really funny. He took his coat and left, waving at them. Dean laughed too, seeing how scandalized Cas looked.
Dean was standing in the doorway, looking stunning as usual.
Dean shrugged. “I don’t know, man, I’ve been busy, I’ve been working on Baby…”
"Yeah, you're right. I should have given you a heads up you".
What had just happened?
“You know, Dean, if I had to chose one person to have sex with, it would be with you”.
“If you’re looking for the pizza, there is still some in the living room, but you’d better hurry up, we just started to eat the last one!”
More than twenty volunteers were sitting down, most of them chatting with each other, by the time Jody cleared her throat.
“Um, actually… I didn’t hear yet… I was wondering if you knew whether, in the society, there were other asexual students?”
“Wait, your date, the cute guy from the CLCP… is Cas?”
“Oh, a grammar exercise? Well, maybe you should ask Cas for that, I’m more of a scientific person, Jack,” Dean said, after leaning over the little boy’s notebook to check what he had to do.
« Because it’s the best way to not lose you forever ! » finally burst Dean.
Cas chuckled. “Oh please, Dean, no, it’s not. What’s brave is talking to a group of adults so freely like you did with the parents earlier. Organizing everything. You’ve been in this organization since your first year and it took me more than two years to gather enough courage to do it.”
“Well, maybe it should be. You’d probably be more relaxed!”
Apparently, Cas had sex with this reaper, April. Did he like it? Was that why he used this dating app to find another partner? Did he not like it? Was it why he was looking for a man, and not a woman? And before he was human? Dean had tried to encourage him to flirt with girls, offered to be his wingman on many occasions. If Cas was gay, maybe that was why he never answered enthusiastically to Dean’s suggestions? Eventually, Dean had given up, and he had stopped trying to set Cas up with girls. He had thought that, probably, Cas was just above this, above human, physical, carnal, prosaic relationships, and that it was why there was no way that Cas and him… could be together. Not like Dean intended, of course. That was why Dean never listened to himself all those times he thought that Cas was adorable, brave, kind, and hot. He was out of reach because he was an angel and he probably couldn’t feel the way humans feel, couldn’t love the way humans love…
“What, Lisa? Not the card you were hoping for?” Dean smirked.
“Cas.”
He helped him to get up. “You can lean on my arm if it helps,” he offered.
"We don't have to do this tonight, you know."
“Yeah, she’s sexy. And she’s super into him. You’re gonna have a good time tonight, Dean,” another guy winked.
Lucy, 25, 5 km away. Cute, but too young. Swipe left. Will, 41, 45 km away. Handsome, but too far away. Swipe left. Tom, 39, 10 km away? Why not, swipe right. Lisa, 35, 15 km away. Pretty, but another Lisa? Swipe left. Castiel, 45, less than 1 km away. Swipe... Wait. Castiel. 45. Less than 1 km away?
“Of course. But tell me, it’s not the first time you’ve looked at this poster, is it?”
Cas was too stunned by the turn of events to fight him on it. While they were driving towards Allen Fieldhouse, where the game was taking place, Dean’s phone buzzed. Once he had parked the car, he checked his message.
The barista was already giving Dean his change. Reluctantly, Cas put his wallet away. “Okay, fine, but I’ll be paying next time, then.”
“Where do you learn that?” Dean asked, a little bit dumbfounded.
Dean knew he should have asked “and you”. Not only was it the polite thing to do, but he was quite worried about his friend. Cas really did seem to be having trouble sleeping, and while Dean was neither an expert on sleep issues nor comfortable with talking too deeply about each other's vulnerabilities, he really wanted to help Cas. After all, he had only been human for a few weeks, and from day one, Dean had filled the role of "human life teacher" with enthusiasm. Sam was helping, of course, but most of the time it was Dean. It was Dean who had gone with Cas to buy new clothes, Dean who had taught him how to turn on the stove without burning himself to make eggs in the morning (Cas loved omelets, and hadn't realized that if he didn't grab the pan by the handle, it would hurt), it was Dean who took care of disinfecting his little scrapes when Cas wasn't paying attention and forgot that now he could bleed and hurt himself (even if they were only superficial wounds, and Cas assured that he could handle it on his own or let the scrapes heal themselves).
“He said that he could teach me, and that I was ‘hot’, but really, I didn’t feel like it.“ Cas stopped for a moment, wondering. ‘I thought that maybe seeing him in real life would make me feel new things, but… No. Tom was nice, though, but…”
Suddenly feeling extremely shy and very far from his comfort zone, Cas looked down, twisting his hands, not daring to look directly at Dean.
Café-in was often busy on Wednesdays, and Dean’s roommate was studying for his midterms in their room, so Cas suggested that Dean come to his place to finish preparing the scavenger hunt. Since Balthazar was in class, they settled in the living-room. They each had prepared a few clues and needed to test them.
The earth didn’t stop turning, Cas didn’t feel a big internal change, and when Dean leaned back, he was still him, and Dean was still Dean, but somehow something had changed between them anyway.
« Don’t you dare leaving me now, Cas », finally said Dean.
Cas liked overthinking and overanalyzing past and future situations, and their afternoon gave him plenty to consider. Dean had kept acting flirty with him, but maybe it had been too much. Like, he wasn’t subtle enough to be serious. It only confirmed what Cas already thought – and, to be honest, feared – Dean hadn't really been flirting with him. He had been only joking around, because he was a very social person who liked to tease others. Cas had seen him interact with that girl, Lisa, at the poker night; he had even thought she was Dean’s girlfriend back then. He had also seen him flirting with Jo, the barista, planning a date with her at his place. Two conclusions could be drawn: Dean was obviously straight, and he liked flirting. Well… was he only straight? Maybe he was bi? Cas hadn’t seen him flirting with any other guys, but he hadn’t really seen him in situations where he could have been. He considered asking Balthazar about it, but then his roommate would definitely know that he had a crush on Dean, which wasn’t something advisable. If he told Balthazar he was serious and didn’t want him to tell Dean, he was almost sure his friend would respect his choice, but Balthazar knew Dean, and perhaps unintentionally the information might slip, because of alcohol for example. Telling Balthazar was way too risky. Besides… The likelihood that Dean could be interested in Cas in return was so low that it was ridiculous to even think it would be possible. Balthazar would laugh at him, or worse, pity him. He could definitely not tell him.
hey guys! author man here... obviously, it’s been a while since my last update. life has been crazy, especially with my mental health. there’s a reason i chose to write about dean having PTSD (hint: i’m projecting) after all.
To this day, that night still stuck out like a sore thumb, the memory more prominent than any others he had. He still remembered the way it felt, the intimacy,
“Yes, Dean. I remember that night very clearly, thank you.” Cas grumbled, his eyes shut.
“What’s up? Can we make this fast? I got places to be,” Dean says, arms crossing over his chest.
“I’m okay, Colt,” he says, then combs a bit of hair back from Lisa’s eyes. “Why’d you stop?”
“Yes?”
bright, and Dean grumbles something to himself. Who the hell left the blinds open? There’s a puff of air blowing on his face every few seconds, and with a groan he turns, buries his face in the mass of fur beside him.
“Colt, wake up. We gotta get Sammy to school,” he says, though there’s no effort made to actually do so. Sam’ll yell when it’s time to go. If it weren’t for his little brother, Dean would likely just spend the morning in bed with his dog, only getting up for walks and games of fetch or tug. He doesn’t care about school; not anymore, not with everything else going on. But he has to care for his little brother who actually has plans,
that’s all for now. hopefully i’ll be seeing you all soon :)
“Fine,” a groan, spoken reluctantly. “Okay, okay. Only ‘cause you’re
Across the way he can see a group of girls staring, talking and it’s nothing Dean isn’t used to. It’s
“It's.. not all your fault, Dean, but..” Cas turned, kissing Dean’s forehead lightly. “Do you… still love me? Like you used to?”
freezing
Dean’s lips curled up into his trademark smirk, eyes flickering black. “To see you, of course, angel boy.”
“Not goin’ in today.”
A sigh, and Dean shakes his head. He doesn’t want to argue, doesn’t want to fight with Sam about this like they had so often before. He looks down at his dog, who’s sitting at his side. “You’re with me, yeah, buddy?”
Dean grins, “atta boy. C’mon.” And together they walk back inside.
“And rule number one? Demons lie.”
“I know it's part of why you fell, Cas.” Dean said softly, sadly, wrapping his arms around Castiel’s waist, under his coat, and nuzzling the angel’s neck lightly. “I'm sorry..”
“No, Dean. You need this class to graduate, and--”
sorry i'm a day late! totally forgot yesterday was wednesday :P
..” things took a turn, things grew more heated and their hands were on each other.
“Dean, I’d like to speak with you after the bell,” his teacher says, soft enough that Dean’s the only one who can hear. There’s a hand on his shoulder, one that Dean shrugs off.
“Always. You know me.”
this isn’t an update/author’s note, not a chapter!
sorry again that i'm a day late! yesterday was a little crazy, and i didn't have the chance to sit down and post. as always, hope you enjoyed :D
Sam rolls his eyes and shoves his brother. “If you two want a room, De, I can go.”
A few minutes go by and finally, Dean rolls out of bed with a groan. Half asleep, he wanders the room and grabs an outfit off his floor--a flannel, tee-shirt and jeans that are
“Morning, Dean.” It’s Sam, somehow energetic even at this ungodly hour, somehow awake. Dean’s jealous, if he’s being honest, but he’s even more jealous of the people who don’t have to worry about being awake.
The rest of the day is uneventful; a blur of talking and writing and papers and of course there’s some goddamn freshman who just
Dean sighs, gently nudging Lisa off so he can deal with his dog. He leans over and runs his fingers along Colt’s head. “I’m fine, buddy. Lay down.” And Colt obeys. “Better?”

“Dean, you’re failing. Horribly.”
Dean sighs and takes his things back out. Five minutes shouldn’t be such a big deal, but when it comes to the end of the day it just
“What? Dean, you can’t cut again.”
“Don’t. Just-- don’t. Eat.”

anyway, i don’t want to abandon this fic... it’s probably my favorite thing i’ve worked on, it i’m being honest. i just haven’t had the motivation to keep it going recently. uploading weekly became too much for me, to the point where i shut down altogether and just... gave up.
Dean groans, but he takes the number from the teacher and plugs it into his phone. He doesn’t really plan on calling, not without being forced to. Whether that’s going to be by his teacher, or someone else, Dean isn’t sure.

“Mornin’, baby,” he mumbles, thumb running back and forth, tracing the curves of the wheel.
When finally the bell rings, the students in the room filter out. But Dean stays where he’s sitting, waits for the teacher to come to him. He’s nervous, and as much as he wants to hide it, a little bump from Colt’s nose tells otherwise.
“Dean.”
also, question for y'all. do you prefer longer or shorter chapters? i'm currently working on one that i can end where it is and have it be a few hundred words shorter than my average, or i can continue it and have it be a bit longer (not sure by how much, though). i haven't been able to decide which to do, so i figured i'd ask here! thoughts?
to ask him what the dog’s for. But then the second-to-last period comes around, and just as he’s getting ready to leave, he’s stopped.
“Shut up.”
A few minutes later, the dog’s vested and both Sam and Dean are ready to go. Dean calls out to Bobby, letting him know they’re leaving, then nods towards the car. And as he slides in, he sighs, resting his hands on the steering wheel.
“I’m a demon, Cas.” Dean dug the blade in deeper, bright blue light pouring from Cas’ eyes and mouth, the eerie-yet-beautiful screech of an angel dying filling the small space. He pulled the angel blade, tucking it into his belt and watching as Castiel’s lifeless form fell limp.
The teacher sighs. “Dean, do you know Castiel Novak? I’ve spoken with him, and he agreed to tutor you. Here’s his phone number.”
“Really?” A grin spreads across the kid’s face, and his arms are around his older brother in an instant. “I bet it was Colt. It was, wasn’t it? G’boy, Colt.” He ruffles the fur on the dog’s head.
“Dean, this isn't you.” Castiel looked to the ground, knowing as soon as he looked into Dean’s eyes he would break.
Finally, the damn coffee’s finished and Dean stands, pours two cups and grabs a few cereal bars from the cabinet. “Here, eat.”
“I don’t like when the dog watches. It’s weird, Dean.”

“Course I do, Cas.” Dean took Cas’ face in his hands, kissing him, smiling softly. “I love you.”
“Morning, Sammy. Sleep okay?”
“Dean..” Cas breathed, his eyes roaming the once-hunter’s body. “You… Why have you come, Dean?”

“Dean.. wait.” Cas mumbled, reluctantly pulling back. “I.. do you know what happened last time we…?”
“Hey, Winchester!” Dean looks up. It’s a friend, thank God, not some jackass trying to start a fight or piss him off. Benny claps him on the shoulder, and Dean gives him a little smile. He waves Sam off and takes a detour with his friend, meeting up with Charlie somewhere along the way. The three sit and talk and Dean’s
The conversation is dropped there, after a little nod from Sam, who grabs the cereal bar and one of the cups like Dean had instructed. He brushes a hand through his hair and takes a small sip, eyes running over Dean’s outfit.

He doesn’t go back to work, though. Hell, he never works in this class. He spends the time doodling in the margins of his notebook. It’s more a journal than anything, filled with brief passages about the night where everything went to absolute crap. But Dean won’t call it a journal, he refuses.
, even in a good enough mood to let Charlie give Colt a few pats on the head.
No, Dean does his best to keep people out. He doesn’t want a repeat of what happened when he was a kid.
“Cas, it's me, I swear..” Dean mumbled, voice softening.
And yeah, just fine. You ready to go?”
And by the look on his face, Cas remembered it all too.
“One more thing, Cas?” Dean mumbled, pulling his arms back to his sides. He chuckled again, that same empty sound, his eyes flickering black and lips curling.
And that’s all Dean needs to get through the day; the encouragement from his baby brother, who looks up to him like nobody else.
“I- I love you too, Dean.”
But then Colt interrupts. Dean’s heart is racing, and the damn dog can’t always tell the difference between adrenaline and anxiety. He can’t get to Dean because the seat’s in the way so he whines, chin resting on the back of the seat. Lisa pauses, Dean groans.

That’s his job anyway, isn’t it? To force Dean into functionality?
however!! like i said, i don’t want to abandon this. i’ll be continuing it at some point (hopefully soon). updates will probably be sporadic, but they will come. alternatively, if i find myself with enough drive, i may write the whole thing, and then start posting weekly updates. it might be a combination of both. but this fic isn’t completely dead, i promise!!
“I have to get to class, Dean,” Lisa says, leaning in for another kiss. “I’ll see you at that party this weekend though, right?”
“It might sting a little, but I'm sure a big boy like you won't feel a thing!" Cas said while pressing the gauze on the wound.
Dean smiled. “Good, then.” He kissed him on the cheek, and Cas turned his head to kiss him gently on the lips in turn. The moment, very soft, continued, until Sam cleared his throat.
Dean burst out laughing, while Balthazar stared at them, confused.
“Well, to be sure about it”, Cas answered quickly, as if it was obvious. “Of course, I am not completely clueless, I identified that the reason why I was feeling differently about you was probably love, and-”
Dean suddenly realized that Cas wasn’t following him. Looking back, he noticed that the angel was looking, amazed, at some Christmas sweaters. He quickly imagined Cas wearing one of them, smiling under a Christmas tree, opening some gifts, just as if it was a normal Christmas morning. The picture he had in mind was perfect. He even imagined himself, wearing an ugly sweater as well, drinking eggnog while watching Cas opening the presents. It was even better. But it wasn’t the reality. It wasn’t possible. In real life, Cas was wearing his dirty trench coat. In real life, they didn’t have any Christmas tree. In real life, he didn’t have a gift for Cas. In real life, he wasn’t that close to Cas anymore. In real life, Cas wasn’t looking at him with such joy and love. In real life, Cas was just broken, even afraid of Dean, not daring to ask him questions. And it was because of him. He was the one who broke Cas. He didn’t deserve to spend a joyful Christmas with the angel. Suddenly, the sight of Castiel smiling amongst the Christmas supplies was too much. He needed to get out. He quickly joined Cas and gave him the shopping list.
