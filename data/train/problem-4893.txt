Michael smiled big. "Great."
“One weekend I was bored and decided to take a walk. I saw it and just decided to walk in. I had no reason too, I just did.” Sam never looked over at Castiel once. He kept his eyes straight ahead at the fire. “Once I did, I saw a sigil on a door inside and she caught me admiring it. She made a joke about it keeping demons away and I must have made a look or something because she knew immediately that I was a hunter. We got to talking and she told me she had an office in back that she used to help hunters having a hard time dealing with the life. She told me to come by the next day and, for some reason, I did.”
Thank you again for sticking with me. I hope you enjoy this chapter.
Cas stared him down but didn’t move as Dean inched closer. “This is far from okay, Dean. You could have-”

----<><><><><><><><>----
This chapter was a bit of a challenge for me. I'm still not 100% happy with it but sometimes you just gotta let it go.
Turning his head and meeting the gaze of all three in his company, he made sure no one else had any more questions before continuing. “With heaven back in working order, alternate universe Michael dealt with, and Lucifer finally…” he paused, cautious of Jack's reaction, “...not a threat, I was planning on taking Jack to finish rounding up the lost souls from heaven.”
"Alpha!”
“He’s right.” Lailah stated. “We can’t help you if you turn. You need to go back.”
"Come on, omega," Castiel grunted, "take it."
She shook her head. “No, I didn’t sense anything until we made our way across the tree line.” He hummed in agreement.
Sam looked away as Dean covered himself up. “It’s a long story. Did Castiel fill you in on the plan?”
"Cas," Sam squeezed his shoulder before pulling him to face Sam. Castiel opened his eyes but avoided Sam's gaze.
Milo crawled into Castiel's lap and snuggled down. It was now or never. Time to be completely honest.
"The angel case, from my dreams."
she started, pulling him in tighter,
“Hey hey hey. It’s okay, it’s going to be okay. I got you.” He felt his body being pulled forward, arms wrapping around him.
“Shit, the kid had even grown on me too over time. I know that I don’t understand what you two are going through, but I do know you’re going through the same thing. Just…” He paused to run his hands through his hair. “Maybe I watch too much Dr. Phil on the weekends, but, please talk to each other. I can’t keep watching you two mope around through life. It’s been 4 years.” In finality, Dean stood up and walked away.
Noises from down the hall alerted Castiel to movement in the bunker; the boys were awake. They were probably doing some research on a monster hunt, Sam rattling off information as Dean made breakfast. If he waited in the room long enough he could manage to avoid Dean asking him if he wanted coffee.
“Are you Tanya?” Jack asked, stopping a few feet from the gravestone, figure only visible due to the headlights of the woman's car.
Castiel shifted in his seat as he was pulled back from his thoughts. The nephilim was always very blunt and, at times, he appreciated that. This time he had wished there was a little more warning.
Tanya rubbed their arms. “Of course. Keep watching over them and be safe.” Haley nodded this time. Cupping her hands over Haley/Jack’s face, she kissed their forehead. “Until we meet again.”
Anxiety fluttered under his skin, remnants of the panic attack he had before he left. His roommate, Balthazaar, had talked him down, reminding Castiel that the whole plan was his idea; no one was forcing him to do anything, and he really wanted to give this a shot while he was still in college. In fact, he wanted it bad enough that he was willing to pay a stranger to try it. Who had he become?
Castiel followed Dean over to the fire pit. Dean sat down in the dirt, his back pressed up against one of the large rocks around the fire. He motioned for Castiel to sit between his legs, back to front. Castiel obeyed, shuffling against the omega to get comfortable, almost laying in his lap. When he calmed down, Dean draped an arm over his shoulder while the other played with his hair over his forehead. Even with his rage boiling beneath the surface, his body relaxed under his touch.
“Jack!” He quickly moved to Jack’s side, placing his hand on his back. “Jack, what is happening?”
Amelia and Kelly shared a look. “Well,” Amelia started, “after dividing out the rations, we noticed an alpha’s worth of food missing.”
Castiel pulled back and frowned. “That's if you're speeding.”
“Hang on a second, guys,” Dean tried to reason, his voice quivering through the beating of his racing heart. “You don’t have to do this.”
“Okay then.” Putting the food away, he grabbed the broom and dustpan, cleaning up the spilled cat food and tossing it away.
Trigger Warning: Panic Attack. Please read with caution
Jack nodded in serious agreement.
The sound of Sam's feet shuffled close, a hand resting on Castiel's shoulder. "No, Cas. Not that."
When Michael finally wrapped his hand around him, he involuntarily thrust his hips up into the heat. He couldn't help it; he needed to move, needed more, so much more.
He tilted his head in confusion. There was something hidden behind her eyes, thoughts she was trying to hide from him. She looked away, shaking her head.
Tanya shook her head. “It’s okay. I have a teenager of my own. Kids will be kids, right?” Castiel nodded. He wasn’t quite sure what she meant but he’d learned over the years to just nod when humans said strange things.
His sister stared at him, most likely searching his thoughts. It took every bit of grace to try and hide his dreams from the inevitable probe. There was no need for anyone to know about his dreams. They were just dreams and would stop eventually.
She frowned sympathetically and wiped a tear from his cheek. He couldn’t resist leaning into her touch.
He wasn't unhappy, not really, he just felt numb. Well not just numb, his heart was pounding hard in his chest as he continued his thrusts, sweat dripping down his face from the exertion and the fact that they were still under a heat advisory and the air conditioning was still broken, but that was a physical sense. Emotionally, he just didn't really feel anything anymore.
Let me know what you think in the comments or visit me on tumblr!
I wanna say THANK YOU SO MUCH for every ones support in this! This is the longest fic I've ever worked on and your constant support has been my fuel for my motivation. You're angels!
Castiel tilted his head in confusion.
Dean sped past the guest bathroom towards the master bedroom. Cas sighed, he really didn’t have the energy to explain everything to Dean right now but he could only imagine what the downstairs looked like to a surprised Dean.
Dean scoffed. "If I had escaped I wouldn't be here right now, Sam."
Dean chuckled and scooted closer to him. “Here, this should help.”
Cas shook his head, "no, I mean the ones that were taken."
He lifted his eyes at his name being shouted close to his face. A blurry Sam was in front of him now, hands gripping his shoulders. When did Sam get in front of him? Sam looked behind him and shouted. Or well, he looked like he shouted, he couldn’t actually hear anything anymore. When had that happened?
"Do you?" Castiel squeezed Dean's hand, "cuz the Dean Winchester I know would be blaming himself for my pain."
"What?"
"Did they hurt you?" Cas asked, ignoring Dean’s question.
“Yeah, he would have.”
The picnic table, the food, the grass, the dirt, the trees. Everything.
Blood pumped heavily through his veins, his lungs burned, his knot throbbed. He felt like an animal. It was freeing in a way. The alpha within was howling in victory with every forceful thrust and squeeze. This was the way things were meant to be. Alpha and Omega. Two souls desperate for one another in ways no human would ever understand.
“No, Sam.” Castiel turned in his chair to better face the younger hunter. “Lucifer hadn’t even known what was going to happen. He never planned for Jack to not follow him and having him side with us? With you?” Sam grimaced. “Sam, Lucifer was desperate. Killing Jack, it was a last minute tactic. He had panicked and Jack was just…”
Eventually Castiel found himself just staring at the once hunter’s face as a way to distract himself. There was a faint tan line around his eyes from the glasses the men wore on the construction sight. It highlighted the crinkled lines beside and above his eyes. He didn’t have bags under his eyes like Castiel did, though. He didn’t look tired and defeated, having grown accustomed to their new lives years ago. Dean had struggled at first to stop hunting, but when monsters and demons stopped being a problem and other hunters had begged the brothers to stop, they did. Sam was the first to agree and had taken him a while to convince Dean to stop, but eventually the older hunter came around.
“So many of us died for the sake of the humans. What have they ever done for us?”
So, what did you think?
“Thank you.” Tanya said, breathing a sigh of relief.
I hope you enjoy!
Castiel leaned forward, pressing their foreheads together. Closing his eyes, he took a deep breath and exhaled. “Thank You, Dean.”
(See the end of the chapter for
Michael sighed. "Look, man. There's nothing wrong with wanting to explore. Humans have been doing it since the dawn of time. Maybe you'll find you love sex and want to explore more, or maybe you'll find out you're ace, and that's fine, too."
*Sigh* There we are. It's finally done. Parts of the next chapter are already done and I do already have the next few chapters planned out so HOPEFULLY I wont take another 2 weeks to get a chapter up. *fingers crossed*
“Mom?”
“Okay…” He finally drawled.
“No...not go away, that was the wrong words, I mean...” Dean raked his hands down his face. “Fuck, I don’t even know what I mean.”
“I know, I know! This happens sometimes. It’s okay.”
Ishim huffed. “She’s perfectly healthy, alpha. They didn’t do this when Emily had Samandriel.”
His thigh muscles burned as he continued his third round of turning kicks, breathing heavy with the knowledge that he was only halfway through the days challenge. It wasn’t hard to understand why he was having a tough time doing the days challenge, but the fact that his mental hang-ups were getting in the way of his pre planned workout was stressing him out. The feeling of anger boiled in his gut with every half completed kick and every pant that escaped his lips. After a fourth half completed kick, he took a few small jumps from his toes and shook out his limbs. He needed to calm down or his workout was going to be for nothing. Stopping and closing his eyes, he forced his body to relax. The sound of the giant tree blowing in the warm breeze, something that usually helped keep him calm, just set his nerves on end. He needed silence; silence he could only get as an angel.
Dean smiled and Cas finally relaxed. The scent of rotting meat slowly drifted away, replaced by Dean’s favorite scent of a salty sea he’d grown accustomed to mean Cas was content. "I got to speak to Sam.”
“I know you believe that all the angels hate you, Castiel, but it's not true.” She stopped walking, facing Castiel. “Yes, you killed thousands of us, but then, when the angels went to rescue you from Purgatory, they said you didn't want to come back, that you fought them to stay.”
“A medium? No, I’m a nephilim.” It was the perfect time for the two angels to step forward.
He doesn't remember how he got here.
Michael switched hands and continued stroking him, while the other went to his nipple and pinched and pulled. Castiel pressed against him, body tensing as his pleasure peeked.
"He's an omega? What could he even do?"
Sorry this took so long to get out! Dean and Cas keep trying to take the story in a different direction and I have to keep pulling them back.
“What did you do to me!” Lailah shouted.
No i’m not.
“Were you headed somewhere?”
She cood in his ear and pulled him into a hug. He instinctively put his nose right to her scent gland, taking in the calming scent of mother and home.
"God damnit," Dr. Adler cursed. "well he's no use to us now." A few guards came in and grabbed Dean’s arms. "Take him to the pit."
__________
Milo went nuts, meowing and circling around Castiel's feet as he grabbed the food and trudged towards Milo's bowl to fill it. “You act as if you've been starved to death.” Milo ignored him and nudged his way past the pouring container to get to his bowl causing some food to spill onto the floor before Castiel has a chance to pull away.
Castiel and Lailah both looked up at a waving Jack. He was standing in front of a small gravestone, much smaller than the rest. The closer they got to the stone, the stronger a feeling built. They were definitely close to the soul and definitely close to solving this case. Once Castiel rounded the stone he was able to read the name.
He turned quickly to see Inias running towards him, eyes wide in a panic.
Castiel closed his eyes and laid his head back as far as his neck would allow. The tension in his thighs slowly released as he submitted to Michael's ministrations.
"I think I wanna tell you about the case I was working on."
"Yea no kidding," Dean breathed. “Doctor douche canoe wasn’t very happy with you, but this,” he pointed to the fake mating bite, “I’m pretty sure got me out of being executed.”
“No, I fell.”
Sam chuckled, "I should be saying that to you."
"Y-yes. I'm okay."
"Let's go inside and you can tell me everything."
“Do you know what set you off?” Dean wasn't demanding an answer, his concern evident in his voice.
She nodded in agreement. “Let’s be sure to track the strongest energy when we reach the other side. The faster we can find the soul the better the chances are of avoiding it becoming a ghost.”
Your fault. Your fault. Your fault. Your fault.
Once again, THANK YOU SO MUCH for taking the time to read this fic! Ya'll are amazing and I love you all! <3
Michael's hands started softly, stroking his thighs again. Castiel found that he could relax into the feeling, getting used to being touched by someone. Michael was right; he was doing this for a reason, so why not enjoy himself? Why not allow himself the one thing he wanted more than anything? He needed to do this, for his own sanity.
He couldn’t help the feeling that this day was going to be a very good day.
"Then you also know that he would do anything for you. Not because he feels sorry for you or is trying to just make you happy. He's gonna wanna put these lights up because he loves you." Castiel slowly shifted from foot to foot. "And I love you too, Cas."
“I dreamed about you last night.” The woman said, placing the flowers in the vases attached to the sides. “It’s been a long time since mommy has seen you. I…” she sniffled back a sob, “I miss you so much.”
“Yea?” Cas asked, tensing up slightly. “What did he say?”
It wasn't long before he finally decided to move, climbing back up the stairs and into their bedroom. If he couldn't calm down now then there would be no way he could calm down before they headed out after dinner. He barely remembered to strip out of his jeans and shirt before he was collapsing onto his bed letting sleep finally take him back over.
"Perfect." Michael stopped the movement of his hands but kept contact with one of his hands. Castiel took a few deep breaths, which allowed him to think clearly. He just needed a second to breathe.
(See the end of the chapter for
Her smile and shake of the head were enough of an answer for him. “Good, alpha.” Amelia stepped closer, and Castiel turned his head as she lifted to her toes to kiss his cheek. “Now, go check on the others.”
Sam smiled and placed the box, and a few more in his basket. "Yea, Cas. I think he would."
Castiel hummed in agreement. Being in a rage was typical for most alpha's. "That's usually been the case." Castiel started, his hand still raking across Dean's skin. "Stuck in a sort of rut rage for a few days and completely blackout for one a few days in. At this rate, I'm not sure I'll blackout at all."
“Mine.” Castiel turned towards the shelter just beyond the firepit and headed in.
Castiel smiled, he definitely liked Lailah. Placing a hand on her shoulder, he squeezed in comfort. “You’re helping now and that's what is important. The first step is always the hardest.”
"I feel I should be thanking you.” Castiel offered. “You're keeping me on my toes."
Jack stopped in front of him, a big smile still on his face. Castiel gave his own forced smile in return. “Hello, Jack.”
“True,” Lailah started, “but we also were walking along the road. It wasn’t until we got close to the tracks that we started to sense anything.”
(See the end of the chapter for
After a few moments he pulled out, burying his face in Dean's neck. Trying not to place all his weight on Dean as his arms gave out beneath him proved fruitless, giving up and trying to shift to a comfortable position being all his body would allow. Sleep threatened to take him over, his exhaustion hitting him hard, but the feeling of Dean carding his hands through Castiel's hair as they both panted against one another kept him in the present. How was it that he could be wrapped in his lovers arms and still feel nothing?
Sam grinned ear to ear, "Great."
That would be a yes.
“Cas?!” Castiel looked up from the discarded ace bandage still hanging half wrapped around his still bleeding and now throbbing hand as he sat on the toilet seat. He had wanted to get it wrapped before Dean had come home but he clearly had failed.
She nodded, eyes large. “Yes, last night!”
Burden.
“It was you.” Jack stated, stepping closer to the soul. “You were in my dream last night weren’t you.”
"How’d you escape? How are you here?” he asked breathless.
Sam sighed at his brother. “I thought with Heaven back in order the souls would just go back?”
"But you didn't want to talk to me about it."
Dean asks for Castiel's trust.
Dean could practically hear the eye roll coming from behind him. "You know what I mean. You've made it to the garden before. Do it again."
Nightmare Scenario is a go!
Castiel knew how insane his plan was and had spent countless days fighting with himself over whether contacting Impala_67 had been a good idea. He'd figured there had to have been other virgins that had used his services as well, which had been what made up his mind—finding out that he was the only one of two hundred killed his spirits.
Castiel bit his lip. "Will you-"
They breezed past the nurses and guards without suspicion. "I was by myself then," Dean argued once far enough away, "and I couldn't even get myself out. Now you're asking me to rescue an entire pack?"
The three stood and admired the tree for a few minutes before Sam yawned dramatically. “Well, I’m beat and it’s snowing.”
“Hey, are you okay?” Castiel looked over and saw Dean staring at him, his green eyes shining with concern. He looked away and down at Dean's hands, a washcloth lightly dripping through his fingers.
Happy Reading!
“Go ahead, Cas,” Michael purred in his ear. “Come for me."
This was very dialogue-heavy but with it being fast-paced, I didn't want to slow the tempo of the read. I hope it didn't read TOO fast though.
Castiel nodded, interested in the shift in conversation.
“No, Cas, wait.” The omega whimpered, his arms wrapping around his alpha’s neck.
Angel!Cas and Jack next week :)
Castiel continued to breath in Dean's scent, his face still buried in Dean's neck. He knew Dean had asked him a question but he just couldn't find the energy to answer him. Eventually, Dean continued to just card his fingers through his hair when he didn't answer, the feeling being the only thing keeping him from falling apart.
"Oh." Sam chuckled. "A lot of people find the aesthetic of Icicles pleasing, so icicle lights.
"Sit in the chair, but backward."
The images of that day flashed behind his now closed eyes. If he tried hard enough, he could even hear the sounds of the blade as it entered Jack’s chest. His own screams as he yelled out for the nephilim, moments too late. Jack’s eyes meeting his before exploding with light. The burnt remains of his tiny wings stretched out beneath his body, barely half the size of what they could have been…
This was not a good idea, by any means. There was no telling what Jack was going to tell this human woman. Plus, they still needed to get that soul before she turned into a ghost.
The kitchen wasn't very big, but the two of them had managed to get by with what they had. There were days when he knew Dean missed the old bunker kitchen and they had been saving money to renovate it, but Castiel couldn't help but love what they already had. It was very human of him, but wasn't that a good thing? He was going to be human for the rest of this mortal life, might as well find something worth appreciating.
She reached a hand out and rested it on his arm. “No, but it shows remorse. Taking in all those souls it made you more powerful than an archangel. It changed you. Being sorry shows evidence that maybe, just maybe, it wasn't you that killed those angels, but the souls you had taken in.”
Sam huffed with a grin and took a swig of his beer. “Is that what they’re calling it these days?”
A cold sensation shot up his arm from his hand. Seconds later cold hands were cradling his face. The sensations shot him out of his mind and he gasped. He realized that Dean was talking to him and looked up into his eyes.
What was the point anymore?
“My being sorry doesn't change what I did.”
Jack smiled, his eyes round and desperate for more information. “Why?”
Failure!!
Dean smirked to cover his nervousness. “I didn’t realize you were so obsessed with me,” he started. “We could have had something special.” The nurse's smile fell replaced by a grimace. Dean would have laughed at the reaction, but the guards were already gripping him tighter and hauling him out the door.
Thank You so much to everyone who has been reading and keeping up with this fic! Ya'll are amazing and i'm really excited for you to read this chapter. A little bit of fluff. A little bit of smut. We do everything this chapter!
Dean touched one of the swollen knuckles and Castiel jumped, grunting as pain shot through his hand all over again. “Well, you’ve definitely got a few broken knuckles.”
Jack nodded.
“The Winchesters. You’ve spent most of your time with them. Why does their opinions of you matter so much?” She asked genuinely. He knew that most of the angels disliked the Winchesters, but having them actually ask why, that was new.
Lailah stepped forward lifting her arm to grab the soul and release it. “I’m sorry.” She said, no sympathy in her tone. Twisting her wrist to grab the soul with her grace, the soul started flickering violently.
He looked away and walked towards the back door not wanting to see the pity that always came on this day. Dean was right behind him, a hand resting on his shoulder as they both stepped into the house.
The stove, according to Dean, was probably from the 80’s and the kitchen tiles were old. The grout was black from poor maintenance but the faucet was brand new. Castiel didn't know much about kitchens but Dean said the last time it had been updated was probably 1995, whatever that meant. He was content, but if changing and updating made Dean feel more at home then who was Castiel to complain? So long as Dean was happy then he was happy.
Castiel’s softened erection stirred as Michael trailed the cool, soft underwear from his lap. He removed them so leisurely that Castiel could have counted the fibers as they crossed over his sensitive head. Tossing the garment to the other end of the couch, Michael leaned forward and traced his fingers along the length of Castiel’s cock, which perked up with renewed interest. Castiel hissed in a breath through his teeth when Michael rubbed a thumb across the slit and pulled it away, damp.
Dean listened, only speaking when he had a question about something. They ate their food, drank their tea and beer, and talked for hours. For the first time in Castiel's few years as a human, he felt content. Ever since they had started their new relationship, Castiel thought he knew everything about Dean. What would make him angry or sad or happy, but Castiel had been wrong. He didn't need to hide things from Dean, if anything hiding made things worse. Communication was essential to healthy human relationships, and he knew this now. He could change. He could be better.
Jack/Haley nodded. “I’m fine for now. I only have a few minutes before I get stuck. I just wanted hug you for the first time.”
They both sat there, Cas in the kitchen chair and Dean kneeled between his legs. He watched as Dean looked down, his lower lip pulled into his mouth as he chewed it in thought. He knew that Dean knew what set him off. These panic attacks were nothing new, having one maybe once every few months. It started a few months after Heaven had finally faded away 4 years ago. Castiel had retained some of his angelic powers but with heaven gone they eventually all just disappeared. The worst day was when his wings faded. Dean knew the drill, but it never made it any easier on either of them. These past few weeks being even harder since it was the anniversary of heaven officially “going out of business” as Dean would sometimes say.
“I know, but…”
“Mom! I'm coming!”
I apologize for any grammatical errors. I did a quick sweep but most likely missed some things. I just wanted to get this posted asap. THANK YOU SO MUCH if you're still gonna read this!
Castiel sighed, looking away. "Will you sing to me? The one you were humming?"
“We need to keep walking.” With that, Leilah turned and continued her way down the side of the road.
Opening his eyes, he found Milo perched next to his food bowl, staring up at him with hope. Hope that any second his bowl would be filled by the sleepy non angel that normally had his bowl filled already but had failed to do so. He gave a small mew as if to say “My bowl is over here, remember?”. Castiel chuckled as he made his way over to the pantry.
Let me know what you think in the comments or visit me on tumblr and shoot me a message!
Castiel tilted his head. “Go away?”
"Have a seat," Michael said, voice strained.
Dean frowned, sliding his thumb up and down his cheek. “I was asking you about your plans for today, are you okay? That's the second time I've lost you today and it's only 6.”
Castiel nodded, eyes back on the road again. “Yes, he was.”
How had Jack known that? The soul hadn’t mentioned that.
He made a face. “It only took me a couple seconds.”
He spotted Amelia rocking Claire not far behind him. Her eyes were watching him, a strange look on her face. Plopping a strawberry into his mouth, he decided to head over to her.
“I stubbed my toe.” Was all Castiel could think to say. Dean was still leaning on him, both hands still caressing his legs.
Hope you liked the new chapter! This was the first time I've ever written ABO heat/rut so i hope it didn't disappoint! Let me know what you think! You can also find me on twitter @Impalazee or on tumblr @zeeimpalaangel
“No,” Jack said, shaking his head. “Haley.”
There was so much Dean wanted to thank the alpha for. Not for just keeping his promise, but for protecting him and making him feel safe. For caring for him. For everything. Cas had been just as much a prisoner as he had, and yet he did everything he could to make Dean feel safe, all while being in his own rut. Cas was a one of a kind alpha. You didn't just let alpha's like him go. He just hoped he’d get to see him again.
Castiel started to panic. "I'm so sorry! I should have said something, and I didn't and-"
Dean studied his brother's eyes. He was still so young, but had clearly grown in the months they’d been apart. He was only twenty-four years old and planning to storm the death star.
“Thank You.” Castiel muttered into his pillow.
Dean lifted himself up fully and threw his leg over Castiel's lap. Castiel very much liked where things were headed. "I think I'm being adorable."
His breaths started coming out in pants. If he could just focus on the logs then the thoughts would go away. They had to. The color of the flames that engulfed them. The sounds they made as the fire burned in and around them...
“Damn right I am.”
"Hey, hey, hey; it's okay." Michael lifted his hands to stop him. "I'm just surprised is all."
“I was actually wondering, if you were going on a mission, if I could join you?” Jack looked up at him through his lashes, hope and nerves seeping through his gaze.
"Y-yea, but you can call me Cas.” He hoped the guy didn't notice the quiver in his voice. “Are you Impala_67?"
“LOOK OUT!”
He didn’t say anything as Dean deposited him in the same chair as earlier that day before heading into the basement. Of course the medical kit had been in the basement. That was where Dean had kept all his old hunting gear and it only made sense that the kit had been with the rest of it. He reappeared with the real kit and set it down on the table next to Castiel.
“Is it that bad?”
Castiel watched his omega carefully. He made a promise. Castiel didn’t break promises. He took a deep breath and nodded once. “I won’t.”
Cas took a deep breath and looked away. A scent that Dean couldn’t quite put his finger on but was unmistakably sadness wafted his way. "While we were-” Cas stopped and swallowed and Dean started to grow worried, “they-"
"He's going to save us?" Another turned to watch Dean as he slowly approached the group.
Dean frowned. "What do you mean?"
Dean grabbed his bag as he headed to the front door, turning to give a small wave goodbye. “I'll see you tonight. Call if you need me!”
The laughter died within him. Oh no. He did remember the last time. It was last year at the same time. How could he have forgotten? This was the worst day of Castiel’s year and he had forgotten already? What did that mean?
Sam nodded. “Fuck him.”
"Yes," he answered breathlessly.
What the hell did that mean? Sam gave him a look before stepping up to let the guards holding Dean push him towards his savior.
"Man jumps from ferry after claiming to have been chased by a glowing light. Three other riders claimed to have also seen the light and 24 year old Koviet jumping after seeming to have been chased around the vehicles on board."
Castiel whimpered, his eyes still closed. He never knew he was into being praised until that moment. Hopefully, his future boyfriend or husband would be willing to praise him all the time, especially if it got him as hard as he was with Michael.
His body jumped as he took in a deep and shaky breath before letting out a sob. All at once, all the emotions from the day came pouring out. He could feel his insides break into a million pieces as he let everything go, his good hand gripping the back of Deans shirt while the other stayed trapped between their bodies.
"-Dean, I need you to understand something." He took a deep breath. "I wasn't actively trying to hurt myself."
The reality of what he was about to do, in addition to the attractiveness of the man before him, made Castiel’s heart kick into overdrive. "Hello," he replied.
He nodded. “Yes. When I took on those souls, I changed, and not for the better. I killed those angels, all of them.” He sighed, looking away from Lailah. “If I could go back and change things, I would. I would have listened to Balthazaar when he warned me. To have given back those souls immediately when Sam and Dean had asked me to.”
Castiel assessed the pallets behind them. At first glance, nothing seemed out of the ordinary. The omegas had already gathered the rations for each person and spread them into small piles of food next to the shipment. “How much is missing?”
“Y-yes.” The woman hesitated. “Who are you?”
"Yea?"
“Will you let me possess you?”
Impala's expression slowly turned into a grin, and his tongue peeked out between his teeth in a way that Castiel knew was meant to be a tease. He wished he had run when he had the chance.
Fair warning, Tears ahead.
Castiel blinked, stunned to think that he’d have any sort of visceral effect on someone who did this for a living. Part of him felt like he should comment, say something--anything--to him, but that’s not what he was there for. Michael was used to doing things like this and had probably decided to add that aspect to his performance to make people feel more comfortable. His wrecked sounding voice, more than likely, had nothing to do with Castiel himself.
“No, you talked and I listened. I never agreed to anything.” Sam groaned, throwing his head back on the chair.
Milo moved on from trying to grab Dean's attention and moved back to Castiel. He was thankful for the distraction, Milo allowing him to card his fingers through his fur.
BIG BIG Thanks to everyone who has stuck with me through this. We're almost at the end of Part 2! I'm excited and nervous to see what you guys think.

“So did I, and so did heaven. As it turns out, not all of the souls have returned like they were supposed to.”
Dean nodded, his gaze already having dropped to his lap while Castiel spoke. Nervous, Castiel dropped his hand and took Dean's. "No matter what version of myself I am, I would want to be here with you, Dean."
Castiel blinked his eyes open to see Dean --one hand in his pocket, the other wrapped around a yellow mug-- standing above him.
“JACK!”
I'm not entirely happy with how the last scene turned out, but I feel like I hit all the points I wanted to. Dean is an emotional ball of fire that I sometimes struggle to rein in LMAO
“Cas…”
No. Stop that. It was just a dream.
“I mean, maybe this is like…” He stood up straight again and placed a hand on the elbow of Castiel’s slung arm. “You know how songs get stuck in your head and the only way to get rid of it is to listen to the song?” Castiel nodded. He had remembered hearing that somewhere. Maybe one of the many youtube videos Dean made him watch from time to time.
Dean paused, clearly upset about something, before sighing and plopping down next to Castiel beneath the tree. Milo hopped up from his spot next to Castiel and trotted over to Dean, rubbing his face against the hunters knee. Castiel chuckled at how loud Milo's purrs were.
"Icicles." Castiel pointed to make his point.
Michael raised his brow. "You sure?"
Castiel smiled, excited and happy in his own way. He was experiencing a lot of firsts, firsts that the nephilims mother would have loved too see. Firsts like Jack’s first ride on a human contraption that propelled vehicles across a body of water instead of having to drive around the massive lake. She would have loved it, he knew that.
Let me know what you think in the comments or visit me on tumblr and shoot me a message!
“What were you dreaming about?”
“Jerk”
He took a deep breath. “During the apocalypse, I had been taken by my superiors for attempting to warn the Winchesters about the plan to release Lucifer on purpose. They had tortured me into submission”
Michael stepped around from behind him, and Castiel followed his pizza sock-covered feet until they were positioned directly in front of him. He didn’t even try to answer the question, too focused on the all-consuming fire that threatened to overtake his senses. He felt Michael’s fingers beneath his chin and gradually lifted his gaze at the incessant pressure.
"Atta boy," Michael commended.
"Cas?" Dean stepped back into Cas’s space. The alpha was hurting in a way he hadn’t seen before.
Night time in Wisconsin wasn't much different than Kansas. The bugs still sang along with the trees as they swayed in the evening breeze, the air smelling slightly of rain to hopefully come in the early morning. Every few minutes the sound of a passing car on the county road would filter through the window drowning out Jack's soft snores.
*****
Sweat dripped down Castiel’s back as he continued his daily workout, the shade from the giant old oak tree doing nothing to protect him from the unforgiving sun. Milo stayed sprawled out a few feet away in the most shaded patch of grass beneath the tree, eyes wide as they chased the gnats flying around him. The cat normally spent his days wandering around the property, usually only coming around for food, but today was different. On days like this one, Milo was known to stick close to Castiel, as if he was his personal body cat. He would never admit it out loud to Dean, but he was almost certain the cat knew what he was doing. That Milo could sense when he was distressed and knew that just his presence would help keep him calm. At least that’s what he likes to tell himself. Having a companion cat usually made him feel better, today was different; it always was.
“But why do you wanna take Jack too? No offense Jack, but, your powers are still spotty and while you've come a long way the past year, you're still a little... unpredictable.”
The two guards stalked away and the two brothers stood still a moment as they watched them disappear around the bend of the hallway. Sam gripped his arm once they were gone and dragged Dean swiftly down the hallway and into a small alcove that housed a fire extinguisher.
“Hey, wake up. I know we're comfy, but my hips are starting to hurt and I'm starting to feel gross.” With a sigh, Castiel allowed himself to be rolled off of Dean and back onto his own side of the bed. He could hear Dean slide out of bed and move into the bathroom as he kept his eyes closed hoping to fall back asleep.
The sound of crunching rocks had all three of them looking up. Jack was making his way towards them. There was a new energy surrounding the nephilim but he couldn’t quite make out what it was.
Castiel shook his head. Rage throbbed under his skin, but he needed to let him know. Dean didn't understand. He clenched his fist to keep the madness at bay. "It's been so long since I've heard it."
One of the demons sauntered up past Tanya's car, leaning against the side of the hood, an angel blade in hand. “That may be sooner than you think.”
Dean stared after Castiel and his pack. People were crying and not in a "I'm so happy you're back" kind of way. Every single one of the people around Dean were counting on him to deliver them from the evil they'd been subjected to for years. Each of the people had a story, had a life, and they all deserved to live.
, but was grateful for her input. “How hard would it be to break it?” He asked honestly.
No. That wasn't right. Jack had survived. So had all of heaven. A rush of his grace washed over him reminding him that that was true. He was a fully powered angel again, thanks to Jack. Memories of their last battle flashed through his mind; it must have been a lapse of memory from his dream. A dream he shouldn't have had.
Because it wasn't real.
"Look, Dean, he took what happened to you hard. You didn't see him in the hospital while you were out. He was devastated, Cas."
Claire pushed her way between the adults, arms up for Amelia to pick her up. Amelia lifted her and positioned her arms for Claire to quickly get her second breakfast. After what was probably two years now of perpetual nakedness, it had become second nature to everyone. No one cared anymore besides a select few. Most of the females stayed topless along with the men to keep cool, and with the humans not supplying any kind of beverage fit for a toddler besides water, the mothers chose to breastfeed the young much longer than usual. It was a matter of convenience.
“Sometimes, our own actions can surprise us. So long as you remember that you saved the world, then there's no shame in not feeling regret.”
Dean finally met his gaze. "Shouldn't I?" He growled. "You've been suffering this whole time and I've done nothing to help you!"
Four years of being human and not once had he ever had the experience of watching the Winchester brothers bicker over who was putting the star at the top of the tree. In fact, he’d never seen them bicker over it as they had never put a tree up before. Castiel wasn’t sure why they never had. He didn’t even remember talking about Christmas before at all. That realization would have bothered him, but now that he had the chance to witness Dean attempt to put up lights on the roof, he was already planning on doing it all again next year. If only to watch the older Winchester curse at inanimate objects.
He finally broke, sobbing against his mother’s neck. She carded her fingers through his hair as he shook in her arms. He let go of all the anger and sadness and loneliness swirling deep within him, gripping her shirt in his fists as they poured out of him like an avalanche. With each heavy sob, a little bit of weight lifted off his shoulders. He drank in his mother’s scent with each breath, drowning in the comfort he hadn’t felt in ages as they continued to rock side to side for a while. His mother would make everything better, she always did.
He hates it here; hates the scentless; hates their prison. Five hundred years of progress thrown away all because these humans chose to round them up like ferals and experiment on them.
Dean huffed. “That's your problem how?”
“Is she here?” Lailah asked.
He nodded. “Yes. I fought back and then fell. The Winchesters were there, in a way. I continued to be their guardian.”
So, I was planning to have this done and posted on time, but, last week I made a last minute decision to quit my job with no backup plan. Obviously that sent my weekend and past week into CHAOS. I've got everything, sort of, worked out on the personal end and am so very happy this chapter is FINALLY done. It didn't quite turn out the way I wanted, but I can only edit so much before I just have to post the darn thing.
Almost instantly, the alpha fell into Dean’s arms and gasped a shaky breath. "He was so scared and alone, Dean.” he cried, “and I couldn't - I tried to - but Sam-"
He could use this moment to smite the area, but the humans were too close. If he wasn't careful he could hurt them. The risk was too high.
Castiel looked away, a part of him begging him to run from the conversation and another knowing he needed to stay.
“And that’s why you care so much. They became your family. Your new garrison.” She offered in understanding.
Castiel watched as the older hunter made his way back into the house. The look on Dean’s face had told him he wasn’t angry, but frustrated. It made sense. He, and apparently Sam, had been sulking through the last four years, both of them trying to bury their memories of Jack with him. Dean wasn’t a therapist, far from it, but Castiel knew he had a point. It was time.
From the moment his mother died when he was a pup, multiple moments throughout Dean's life forced him to feel overwhelmed. Watching his father drink himself into oblivion from the grief of losing his wife. Presenting omega in a motel alone with his tired little brother pup. Watching the news as Chicago went dark. The feeling of helplessness never got easier no matter how many times he was forced to deal with it. Being dragged down the hallway of the prison he was in, two guards on each side of him grabbing his arms tight, was one of those moments.
“Yes, Haley.” Jack stated. Castiel looked down at him with a frown.
Castiel smiled as the silence between the three of them was broken once again. Jack had been hounding Lailah with questions and he was making zero efforts to stop him. He knew Lailah was getting annoyed but a part of him was enjoying seeing the nephilim so curious and happy. Was it was a side effect of his continued dreams, he wasn't sure, but he figured a few too many questions wouldn't hurt anyone.
The nephilims face faltered for a beat, looking away and shuffling his feet before meeting his gaze again. “I managed to get a few hours.”
(See the end of the chapter for
“Maybe I should call into work. Stay here with you in case it happens again?” His eyes met Castiel and they stared at one another for a moment. He was letting Castiel choose. For some reason that realization made a warmth build in his chest. For the second time today he was reminded why he loved this man.
Castiel shivered at the memory of his capture. The wood pieces that scattered across the foyer as the deadbolt forced through the door frame. Electric currents that forced his chest to clench as they washed threw his body. Muffled screams as he fought for consciousness while the zip ties around his wrists tightened. He had been stripped of his dignity, forced to stand naked with other alphas and omegas. The cries of the young and the whimpers of the omegas weakened by their heats still played behind his eyes like a movie that wouldn’t end. He remembered having to throw alphas in a rut rage off of the omegas in heat as he barked orders at the sterile alpha’s to help protect the omegas. The ebb and flow of scents and emotions that forced them all to submit, or allow their minds to slowly go mad while locked up in the cages for weeks before being transported.
He felt heavy; like his body was going to drop through the bed and floor and down into the living room. Sleep hadn't helped and the morning sex just made his body tingle with exhaustion. He wanted to go back to sleep but he also wanted to drink some coffee in the backyard while he sat in his favorite chair and stared at the trees lining the edge of their property. It was something he did every morning since they bought the house 2 years ago but for some reason he wasn't sure he'd do it today.
Dean met his eyes at that.
"Good boy." Castiel inhaled in surprise at the sensation he felt from the praise; this guy was going to be the death of him. Michael kept his chin hooked over Castiel's shoulder as he whispered. "I'm going to walk you through what's going to happen, okay?
"Keep yourself safe, Sammy," Dean said, a sad smile on his lips.
Suprise suprise.
“Jack,” Lailah started, “can you sense which direction the soul went next?” Jack closed his eyes again, turning towards the lake.
“Yes...I….I think so.” Her voice was small, like a young child’s.
With his underwear in hand, he stepped closer intending to place them with the rest of his clothes, but Michael took the opportunity to slide a hand up his stomach and flick one of his nipples, causing Castiel to gasp and drop them to the ground instead.
Castiel smiled as the last bits of panic fell off his shoulders, clearing his mind. “No.” He raised his hand as Dean opened his mouth to protest. “I'll be okay. I think I'm going to just rest today instead of work in the shed.”
"Okay." Cas clenched his fists and moved them to cover his groin.
Their scents already alerted him to their elevated stress levels as both women turned around. "Alpha." They said in unison.
Not a graveyard.
Castiel headed towards Duma's hut and snagged a water bottle as he passed his own rations pile.
Castiel moaned when Michael’s other hand grasped his cock and resumed pumping. Castiel's hands shot behind him and gripped Michael's thighs. He needed to hold on to something, anything to avoid grabbing Michael's hands. Castiel never knew it could feel that good. Never in his life would he have ever guessed that he would feel like that. Heaven was indeed a place on earth.
*****
After a few minutes his body started to grow heavy on his legs. Dean must have sensed his dilemma as he moved them both towards the kitchen table, gently pushing Castiel's shoulders down to get him to sit. He obeyed, plopping down and sighing.
Thank you so much for sticking around for this fic! It means a lot to know that there's some people out there interested enough in this story to read over 30k words of it. This is a planned out 3 part series. Part 2 is still a WIP, but the first 2 chapters are practically done. My stay-cation starts in less than 24 hrs and I plan to spend most of that time writing Part 2 and will plan to start posting Part 2 Feb. 11th. Oh, and Part 2 is in Dean's POV so we'll get to see how he felt about Cas in their first 6 days together.
"Who is he?"
He sniffed as a wave of tears flowed down his cheek.
(See the end of the chapter for
The soul hadn’t been lying. Her mother did show.
He led Dean back towards the entrance and to one of the many huts surrounding the clearing. While the hut he shared with Cas had been just a cabin in the woods, this new one was an entire campsite. Each hut looked like a tiny cabin built for no more than two people on a few day long trip. The wood was old and some logs were warped, but they seemed sturdy enough for having still stood tall after a few years in the dome. Once again, Dean had found himself wistful of a yearned life of camping trips and equality; a life he hoped he’d one day get to experience. Though, if they made it out safely, he wondered if he’d ever look at camping the same again.
“Jack, can you feel anything?” Lailah asked as they all stood next to the railing, the lake passing by underneath them.
Castiel shook his head. Dean stood and guided him back downstairs to the kitchen.
Dean stopped on a dime, his chin dropping to his chest. Castiel hurried the last few feet between them and whirled around in front of Dean.
*****
“I’m not a child, Dean.” Castiel snapped half heartedly. He wasn’t upset with Dean, just himself.
“Jack would have loved it.” he hears himself say before thinking better of it.
The kitchen had been cleaned, somewhat, of the broken door pieces. The door itself was still hanging for now, Dean making plans to take it down tomorrow on his day off. A few smaller broken pieces were still laying on the ground next to the breakfast nook and under the table. Castiel mentally made a note to deep clean the kitchen in the morning. The last thing he wanted was for anyone to get a splinter in their foot.
“Maybe…” Dean shifted and took a deep breath. “...maybe you should all talk about it.” Castiel slowly looked up at Dean. Was he crazy?
“Fell, w-wh...how?” Tanya asked, eyes moving between her daughter and Castiel.
Castiel’s breathing picked up at the subtle presentation his omega was offering. He stepped forward and slid his hand around the omegas neck. The omega whimpered and tilted his head back. Castiel took advantage and latched into the scent gland so graciously offered up. He pushed his body forward, coaxing the omega to bend forward. The omega dropped his hands on the cot and arched his ass up and towards Castiel. Castiel’s free hand snaked its way around the omega’s waste and slipped his hand below the omega’s balls. He grinned when his fingers found him soaked with slick. His omega whined and shifted his stance wider. Castiel rubbed his fingers along his perineum, collecting as much excess slick as he could.
Was he falling apart?
“Hey, you okay?”
He shook his head. “No, but it must not have been too long ago.” Jack headed up the road, feet moving swiftly on a mission as the two angels followed behind.
Sam turned in Castiel's peripherals and joined him. There were multiple different kinds of these icicle lights and Castiel admired the photos on the boxes.
“You would want that?” He asked, skeptical.
“Her?” Castiel asked. When angels felt a human soul they only felt the energy. Jack was sensing more than him or Lailah could.
Castiel blinked as cinnamon penetrated his senses. He found himself standing just inches in front of Dean, who was facing him concerned. In an instant, everything came back to him. His rut, the humming, his mother, the song.
The rest of the ride was spent in silence from the group, the only noises being the roar of the engines and the occasional car doors opening and closing as travelers exited their vehicles to admire the views before climbing back in as they inched closer to the other side. There were many views that Castiel admired after all his years; this was one to remember. Not only was the view of the sun eclipsed by the railroad tracks that stretched across the lake stunning, but also the sight of Jack having the experience for the first time.
“Lailah, please.” Castiel laid a hand on her back, careful not to send over any of his grace just yet. She calmed but continued to say nothing as she glared at the nephilim. “Let me take you back to the motel.” He offered. “If we can’t heal you then we still need to treat the wound for your vessel.”
"How about this," Michael sat up straight and regarded him closely. "I'll change up my plans for you. The moment you feel uncomfortable or wanna stop, you tell me right away, okay?"
******
The cold and wet thing in his hand started to drip through his fingers. Opening his palm, he looked down and saw the last bits of a melting ice cube. It slid around in his hand as he tilted it side to side, watching as the melting piece moved around in the growing puddle. Some of the water began to drip down the sides of his hand as he slowly closed his grip again, the feeling drawing him back into his body. The more he stared at his wet hand the more he realized how not wet his other hand was. Closing them together, he interlocked his fingers waiting for the last bit of the ice cube to melt away.
Castiel missed them like this. The two of them laughing and spending time together. Sure they worked together five days a week and every once in a while Dean would come home late after going out to dinner with Sam or just going and getting a few drinks, but this, sitting in their backyard, talking, eating, laughing, and having a few beers; he knew it had been far too long. In fact he couldn’t remember the last….
“Will you let me possess you?”
Your fault.
"DNR rescue woman stuck in rocks. Davichou claims she was chased by a glowing orb down the railroad tracks before slipping and falling down into the rocks below. This is the third claim of a glowing orb hanging around WI-113 between the ferry and County V."
“I told Dean not to bring up Jack because I knew that you were having a hard time with his death and being human…”
On the far side of the clearing, across the fire pit, was a series of picnic tables. The whole village sat in their usual places as they ate and chatted away. Castiel's two pups were with Hester, slurping away at their honeydew melon as Amelia and Kelly talked nearby. Castiel was lucky to have Amelia and Kelly as the mothers to his pups. They were strong women and even stronger omegas. Both of them had similar ground rules when they had helped each other, a strategy the rest of the village was unwilling to do. After around six months of being in this hell hole, everyone had agreed they needed to mate. It brought more peace and order to the village, but it also brought despair. Many of his charges didn't like their mates; they simply needed a mate to survive.
He paused, taking a deep breath to try and hold off the inevitable water works. “I feel like I’ve failed.” Sam looked at him then. “Not only did I fail Jack, but I failed the angels, heaven. He was supposed to save everyone, it was his destiny. Kelly believed it with all her heart and I promised to help him achieve that. All I helped him do was kill his father, and it was only after Lucifer…”
“Familiar?” Lailah asked, standing to make her way towards them. “In what way?”
“Lailah called while you were asleep. She said she’d be here in 20 minutes.”
The plot thickens
"You mean a lot to me. I know that we don't talk as much anymore with you and Dean living together now, but I wanna change that."
Once again, please let me know if I need to add the Non Con warning to this fic.
He still remembered the fight. Dean yelling about what could happen if they stopped and Sam yelling about them having been stopped already since there was nothing to hunt. He remembered the whispers when they thought the non angel was sleeping, arguing over whether he was okay or not. He remembered the first waves of nightmares and Dean being there instantly. He remembered when the brothers announced they were retiring. He remembered watching Dean. He remembered the retired hunter hiding under the hood of the Impala and burying himself in beer. He remembered when Sam asked him to join him at the construction site. He remembered watching the stress fall off the retired hunter as the months went on. He remembered when they bought the house and Dean smiled all throughout the move. He remembered their first night in the house all alone.
"Our pups," she said, gaze boring into Dean's. "You're going to rescue our pups."
He blinked, confused as to what had just happened. Some angels were known to have their own grievances with humanity, but only the dangerous ones every spoke as Lailah had. How could she be so angry towards the humans and yet be the leader for finding and retrieving the lost souls? Perhaps he had been away from his own kind for too long.
Castiel smiled. "I say that sounds like fun."
Michael smiled at him. "Not at all. It makes you human." Castiel huffed. "Don't believe me?"
Castiel moved from the doorway to give space as Jack ran back through the door and towards the bathroom. He smirked, shaking his head at the sound of the faucet turning on followed by the distinct sound of spitting in the sink. A few seconds later, the nephilim was running back through the door.
“I’m not sure.” Castiel responded, reaching his own grace out to try and sense what the nephilim was. “But at least we know this to be a place of interest.”
It was an understatement. With the capture, being shot, and nurturing Dean's anxiety down to a mellow heat haze, Castiel was feeling great. More than usual, infact. In all his years, being this lucid and not in anguish over his rut was unusual. It had only ever happened one time before, and that was back when he shared his first rut with Balthazaar after their engagement.
“Cas, I’m sorry.”
Castiel leaned forward and placed his nose at the juncture between neck and shoulder. With a deep breath in, he hummed. Inias's scent was tantalizing--Peppermint and chocolate mixed with an enticing hint of chile pepper-- It made Castiel's mouth water.
Castiel hummed a laugh. Dean was being extra cuddly at the moment and, for some reason, he found it adorable. The scent of vanilla was mixing with the overwhelming sweetness of honey. He assumed it meant the omega was feeling much happier and his inner alpha preened at the thought. All he wanted was to make the omega he was trapped with feel less like an animal and more comfortable around a strange alpha.
Dean loses it, his feet stomping under the table, a silent laugh still stuck behind the ball of still unchewed meat almost falling out if his mouth. Castiel grinned, unsure of who Joe was or why the story was funny but enjoying the brothers light hearted stories all the same.
Michael's lips around him? Castiel was beginning to think he did. The thought had never crossed his mind before, but those lips and mouth were starting to elicit feelings he'd never given much credence to. Castiel could almost picture it. Michael, on his knees, his green eyes staring up at him with a hunger Castiel wouldn't be able to resist. Would he grab his hair and-
“Castiel?”
Micheal shrugged. Castiel was shocked at how casual he was being. He wondered if it was because Michael had done this many times, with many different men, or if that was just how people who enjoyed sex were? Balthazaar never seemed anxious when he brought back his one night stands, and those he brought over never seemed to be apprehensive either. Maybe his friend was right, and he was overthinking the matter? Sex was supposed to be fun, right? So, why worry?
Dean scoffed, but Castiel caught the grin he tried to hold back. "Whatever." They both laughed.
"Old man?" Castiel huffed but leaned into Dean a bit more. "I'm thirty-two. I think."
As if on cue, a knock sounded at the door. He stood and made his way over to the door, opening it. Lailah’s vessel was shorter than his, only coming up to his shoulders. Her vessel had very thick curly dark brown hair and was sporting the usual grey suit that the remaining angels had all started to all wear. She was frowning and seemed slightly annoyed.
“Dean, I don’t understand what happened…”
Wonder if Dean will be able to get Cas to talk about the scent bond? Or will he put it off?
"Oh, fuck!" His hands shot behind him as he leaned back more and pressed down against Michael's thighs. "Michael!"
Waste.
The group continued forward and onto the grass of the cemetery. A breeze gently blew in from the south, blowing Castiel’s coat around his thigh as a few birds whistled away in the shedding trees. The trees lining the property were spotted with different hues of red and orange, the leaves shining brightly under the intense sun. They made their way over the piles of leaves and onto the main property. The site wasn’t very big, signs of an always small community ever present in the smaller than normal number of gravestones.
"Gonna make you feel so good, Cas."
“...I just figured, until you were ready, we wouldn’t talk about him. Especially after you destroyed that door.”
Milo jumped off him and the bed, Castiel watching as the black and white cat wandered over towards the bedroom door. He sat up on his elbows, pillow crushed between his arms, as he watched the cat with interest. Milo looked back at him and moewed again.
Cas tilted his head with a questioning squint, “What do you mean?”
He closed his eyes again and sighed. He could finally feel the stress from the day drift off his shoulders allowing him to sink into the chair. Maybe everything could be okay after all.
Castiel turned back to Sam, Dean still pouting behind him. “I was briefed on a case in Wisconsin. I'll take Jack and if…” he raised his voice as Dean attempted to protest, “ AND IF something goes wrong then we'll come back here and find a different way to help Jack.” Jack smiled at him while the brothers both just stared. Sam eventually sighed with a shrug while Dean rolled his eyes and nodded.
The nephilim opened his eyes, looking up at him. “I’m not sure. I can just feel it. There’s energy that I can sense, like you I think, but there’s more. I can just tell that she’s a she and that she’s young. She’s looking for something, I think.”
Sam sighed in frustration but didn’t make a move to leave. He took that as a good sign.
Michael slowly slid his hands side to side over Castiel's abdomen. "You're going to sit in this chair," he indicted the desk chair to their right, "and, I'm not only going to give you the best handjob of your life but edge you until you're begging me to let you come."
Dean's hand slid around to the back of his neck and pulled him down for a kiss. Leaning in, he deepened it, desperately trying to feel something. Sex had never been like this before and a small part of him was starting to worry. Was this that thing he had been reading about? When couples started to get bored? He wasn't bored, at least he didn't think he felt bored. Life with Dean was challenging and even difficult at times, but it was also always exciting and invigorating. It took them awhile to find their groove as a couple but once they had, well, they couldn't figure out how they'd gone this long without one another. And the sex? They had been doing that, what, a few times a week at least. Bored was far from what he felt.
I hope you enjoy this chapter! We're going to get a little more info on this strange guard promising escape and what's been going on "behind the scenes"
Everything seemed normal; nothing quite out of place. Maybe he was overreacting? Maybe the dreams were just a side effect of his restored grace. Maybe there was nothing wrong at all.
Okay, so this chapter is a little bit shorter than the others as I officially decided to cut out the non con touching scene. It still happens, but you won't have to read it. I didn't like it and it wasn't written well either because I didn't like it. However, it is mentioned briefly
Jack turned back to Tanya as she cried. “She...she has more to say.” The woman sniffled, giving Jack her full attention. Castiel squinted. Something was wrong.
Jacks eyes lit up in understanding, as if reacting to the sensations physically. “It feels familiar somehow. Is that normal?”
“Uh.…” he stammered, shifting uncomfortably from one foot to the other. “It’s not of import.”
Castiel shook his head. "No, I'm okay. Thank you."
He watched as his brother retreated and the doors closed between them with a heavy thud. “Three days,” Dean mumbled to the closed doors. With a heavy heart, Dean turned back to regard the small crowd down the small hill. There was no going back.
“Could you ever consider me family?”
With every breath he took, the frustration built. He never needed to work out as an angel. His vessel was never something he needed to worry about. Now it was. Four years later and he still wasn’t over it. He was not meant to be human. He was not meant to live a life like this. To need to eat, exercise, sleep...it was too human. He had been human before and it was just as awful then as it was now.
Michael set down the bottle and moved closer. Castiel's eyes widened as he watched Michael’s hand reach out and felt his slippery fingers finally touching him. He gasped and tensed up as one finger slowly trailed its way along the underside of his member, from base to tip. He could feel his cock twitch from the stimulation, jerking up toward his stomach. Castiel squeezed his hands into fists and shoved them under his thighs to avoid reaching out and touching Michael.
Castiel deflated. He knew it was coming, he just had hoped Dean would have lasted a bit longer. "Dean-"
“What?!” Came Dean's not surprising reaction. He did seem far more upset than usual, causing Castiel to tilt his head in frustrated confusion. It was normal for Dean to argue with his decisions, but this was different. Strange even. Then again, he was still comparing real Dean to dream Dean, so maybe he was just being overly judgemental for no reason?
"Perfect timing, Sam." Dean huffed once they were safely tucked away. He couldn't see his little brother through the uniform and visor so he slowly reached up and grabbed the helmet to pull it off. Sam took the helmet into his own hands once freed and smiled as Dean placed his hands on his cheeks to take him all in. The long unruly hair, the crinkles around his eyes, the smile. Sam was real and standing right in front of him.
“I hate to say it,” started Lailah, “but I think you’re right. We need Jack first.”
The souls he had helped round up the past few weeks were not as active as this one seemed. Hopefully Lailah would have some ideas when they meet in the morning.
“I can’t get the image out of my head.” Sam was the first to speak. “I repeat that moment in my head over and over and over. If I had just done something different. If I had just known…”
Castiel watched as Dean sighed and shook his head. Where was he going with this?
“Oh, uh, Mia.”
“Sam..”
“You going somewhere Cas?”
At the top of the incline, the road came to a T. The right seemed to head further into town while the left seemed to head out of town. Jack studied both directions, every few seconds closing his eyes. The third time he looked towards the left he inched forward a few steps.
Inias placed a hand on Castiel’s bare chest and chuckled. "Not now, alpha."
Castiel gave a nervous chuckle as he looked down at their feet. He could feel a building pressure in his chest, his breath starting to slowly quicken. Why was he freaking out? There was no need to freak out. Was there? The sides of his vision began to blur as his heart rate started to pick up. He felt like he was being chased and was running for his life. He knew he was standing in his own kitchen but couldn't shake the feeling of being in danger. Something was wrong. Something was very wrong.
“They were archangels.” She supplied, “God made them first to help create the universe. When he was done, he made the angels.”
Castiel's chest warmed with the knowledge that Sam wasn't upset with him. Perhaps all wasn't lost with him and Sam after all. They could be true friends.
Mommy & Daddy Love You Very Much
Castiel woke to the feeling of Dean lightly slapping his shoulders.
Castiel remembered his first day after being separated from the masses. The scentless humans poked and prodded every part of him before being taken to the fake village with fake huts and a glass sky. The omegas showed up the next day, and that was when the fighting started. Certain alphas had tried to rape and mate unwilling omegas, led by Raphael. Against his better judgment, he took up the leadership role the rest of them wanted and fought him. Castiel was the only one who didn't expect to win, the others having decided he should become the village provider -- a position their society had removed generations ago. He had tried so fucking hard to get the humans to listen and understand that they weren't feral, but they never understood. Or maybe they did and didn't care. When they used the cattle prod on him, that’s when he knew he needed to do more to keep his pack safe.
Cas shook his head. "Sam showed me. They were doing something to the pups, Jack was th-" Cas stopped and tried to gather himself.
Castiel fumbled around for words. "That's the problem, I don't know. One moment I was an Angel, and the next I was here, human. Then I'd fall asleep and be an Angel again."
“I don't need sleep.” He responded instantly.
Jack jumped from the bed and gently pushed past him to follow her out the door.
"That they're surprised you're a virgin?" Castiel nodded. "Well, to be honest, you're too hot to be a virgin." Castiel scoffed. "Plus, I've been doing this for two years and have seen maybe, I don't know, 200 different guys, and you're my first virgin."
October 16th 1993
“Alpha, please.” The omega cried.
“Jack.” He warned cautiously.
The air in the kitchen was thick with humidity as Castiel made his way in, the afternoon sun beating down on the earth reminding the world that it may be October but it was not quite fall. The sound of birds filtered through the small fan that was mounted in the window above the kitchen sink. Taking a moment, Castiel stood in the open doorway of the kitchen, closing his eyes and taking a deep breath as he allowed himself to shed the last bits of tension still in his shoulders from the latest panic attack. He could get through this day, he had to. The last few years were proof of that. A nagging feeling in the back of his mind, though, reminded him to stay away from thinking about his nap dream. No good could be had by remembering him. Not right now. Not again. Not yet.
"No?"
“What if talking about it will help you heal? Maybe you just need to remember what you both lost and that both of you share that loss.”
Her scent flooded his nostrils with uncertainty as she shook her head. "I know, but," she paused and looked back over her shoulder towards the clearing, "I thought you ought to know right away."
“Let him go.” said Lailah. “That soul is going to turn and running after him won’t help her.”

The sounds of the brothers eating breakfast as they talked about a possible hunt echoed down the halls. It was a typical beginning of the day, only Castiel was usually in the library or in the kitchen with them, not sleeping. There was still an eerie feeling in his gut, the phantom taste of coffee still on his tongue as he made way towards the kitchen. A part of him didn't want to bother them; didn't want to ruin their breakfast and, from the sounds of Dean's humming and Sam's slow typing, their happy moods. Why did he always feel like he was ruining something for them? Had he always felt that way?
