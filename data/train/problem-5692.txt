It was cold, however; wherever he was. He could hear people talking. Their voices echoed in and out.
“There’s currently a chemically induced fire in the city that emergency personnel can’t seem to control and they require the Avengers’ assistance for evacuation immediately.”
“I know what you did,” he says coldly, lowering his voice and not breaking eye contact. “I’m willing to bet I’m not the only one.” He shifts his eyes towards the crowd. “All of these cameras and cell phones… we’re living in an age where information travels fast. I’m sure someone else here caught what you did, and it’ll be all over the internet in less than a minute.”
Steve relishes the soothing feeling of the water washing away the taste of ash. He tries again to open his mouth and talk, but Tony takes the glass away from him and gently places a hand on his chest to push him back down.
in love with you for a while now. Hence, all of those lunch dates and the million other excuses I made up to spend more time with you. But, I guess I never really made that clear. Also, why would I want anyone else when you’re
“I don’t know, Sam. Barnes may have a point.” Rhodey snickered. “You definitely sound like you need it. Poor, Groot.”
“Of course, I’m fucking in love with you, you absolute moron,” He splutters, crossing his arms against his chest like he’s trying to protect himself. “I’ve
“Man, have I mentioned that I can’t stand you sometimes?” Sam jokingly grumbled as he shrugged his hand off. “You’re usually the one who needs saving.”
“So, uh, why don’t you and Dodger stay down here for a bit, so that they could continue their game while we figure out how to stop this little guy from leaving your floor.” Tony rubs the back of his neck, a nervous tick. There’s a hint of red on Tony’s cheeks.
With a renewed spark of curiosity in his eyes, Tony sits down next to Steve, leaning in close to peer over his shoulder. Steve is hyperaware of the warmth that he brings with him, and he wants to bask in it, hold him.
Without looking back, Steve leaves Tony’s room to suit up, wishing, more than anything, that he could go back.
Rhodey. His best friend. Rhodey had been the first to reach him when he collapsed against the rubble. He remembered the hand he placed on his shoulder. He was silent, but his eyes conveyed the uncertainty and worry he didn’t vocalize.
Steve looked on as Rhodey, Peter, and Pepper made their way over to Tony, as they were the ones closest to him. Steve struggled to make his way over as well, even as his leg screamed in protest. He felt a presence beside him and he turned to his right to see Thor, also gazing at Tony in worry and uncertainty. Without looking over at Steve, Thor wrapped an arm around his waist to help him support his weight and together they made their way over to their fallen comrade.
Steve sighs. He finishes tying up his running shoes, grabs his drawstring bag and StarkPhone, and makes his way out of the bedroom door. He goes down to the communal kitchen to get something in his stomach before his run. It feels like one of those days where he might be running longer than usual.
If Steve hadn’t had the cowl on at that moment, Tony would have probably felt worse than he already did. The guy could hurt someone with that sad, puppy-dog eyed look - and Tony had seen it before; it just took practice not to fall for it in other circumstances.
“Nothing,” she confirms and scratches behind the dog’s floppy, brown ears. “Sorry, buddy. But, maybe it’s a good thing.”
Tony motions for Dodger to join him on the bed as Steve walks around to the other side and lays down. His thoughts are going a hundred miles a minute and his stomach flutters because this is what he always wanted. But it’s not real.
Steve finally makes a move to sit up, groaning at the strain that puts on his abdomen. He tries to clear his throat to speak, but that triggers a harrowing cough. Tony is at his side in an instant, one hand supporting his back and the other holding a glass of water up to Steve’s lips.
“Well, like you said, information travels fast,” Tony says, a corner of his mouth lifting into a slight smirk just as Steve begins to feel abashed now knowing that Tony must’ve seen the whole debacle. “How’s your new four-legged friend doing?”
Dodger, seemingly unimpressed, walks closer towards Tony’s shoes, turns his body around, and simply drops his body on top of them. Steve and the rest of the Avengers are having a hard time stifling their laughter as Tony continues to look absolutely perplexed at what’s happening. Steve takes some pity on him and makes his way over. He gives Tony a slight smirk and a raised eyebrow as he gently picks Dodger up from the floor.
Before Carol Danvers made her existence known, and to distract himself from his internal grief, Steve and the rest of the Avengers threw themselves into figuring out what had happened to the people who vanished after Thanos snapped his fingers. They worked tirelessly, and when Carol showed up, saying that she could detect a distress signal from deep into the intergalactic plane, Steve felt a glimmer of hope - that it was Tony. Seeing Tony for the first time since 2016, and seeing him like
Practically every night, Steve goes to sleep with Dodger curled up on his bed (apparently his dog bed is just to lounge on because he never sleeps in it at all, even when Steve tries fruitlessly for an hour) and wakes up to him missing.
“You’re always drawing in that thing. When are you finally going to show me what you’re working on?”
Christine smiled and nodded. She turned on her heel and walked back towards the direction she came from, leaving Pepper and Steve to their own devices. Pepper looked back at Steve and said, “So, Tony’s room is down that hall,” she pointed towards the left hallway. “Room 616, if you’d like to go see him. Happy and Morgan are in there right now.”
Steve sits on his bed flipping through his sketchbook, looking through the various sketches of Tony, and they aren’t just portraits. There are sketches of Tony’s expressive eyes, his lips, his hands that he used to create
“Good to have that covered,” Rhodey said. A beat. “So are you going to answer my question from earlier?”
Steve places the leash on his dresser and makes his way to the bathroom to get ready for bed. It’s been a long day and he’s pretty exhausted with everything that’s happened today.
Pepper smiled down at her daughter and proceeded to get up and walk out of Tony’s hospital room in the direction of the elevators.
“No, Dodger. You should really sleep in your own bed, c’mon.” He gets up from the bed and motions Dodger to follow him. He points at the dog bed and says, “This is where
“N-no, Captain America, sir. No collar, no owners. He’s been loitering around the park for days now.” The man is visibly afraid as Steve towers over him, but he still manages to say all of that almost confidently.
So, I do have a plan for where I want to take this fic. I do see an ending and I think it’s safe to say that we’re finally at that point where I can get the plot moving.
Steve recognizes Dodger’s vocalizations and of course the voice is Tony, it’s always Tony. But why does he sound so upset?
Tony seems to be studying him closely, and he furrows his brows as he imploringly asks, “Are you sure?”
“I don’t let him anywhere near my kitchen. It’s a recipe for disaster. He made me a burnt omelet once, as an apology. Never again.”
The silence that followed was companionable, which was fine and all, but it felt as if it was lacking the vibrancy that Tony carried with him. If Tony had been here with them, he would have deflected the allegation with his sharp wit. They would never hear the end of it.
He checks the bathroom, the bathtub, even the shower stall, and there’s no sign of Dodger anywhere. He goes and searches around the rest of his floor behind the sitting area, the drapes—he checks under the table and still comes up with nothing.
Also, I sent this to my friend the other day and she was like, "why /didn't/ they have Strange portal him to a hospital anyway?" Like... he didn't /need/ to die for shock value.
He walks back to his bed and lays down for the second time tonight. He pats the empty side of the bed and Dodger follows the cue to jump on the bed and curls up next to Steve.
Actually, that’s most of the time but it’s also counterproductive because he loves to hear him talk passionately about literally anything. He loves the way he just lights up when he talks about his new inventions, talking a million miles a minute, so animated and alive.
. This will be something new, right? Something that he wants just for himself, on his own terms since up until this point, after waking up from the ice, the future’s been forced onto him. He had always wanted a dog growing up, but he couldn’t have one because of money and his allergies which triggered terrible asthma attacks. But, neither one of those things were a problem for Steve anymore.
Also, Dodger has become his companion. Tony was right when he told him that he should keep Dodger, he was good for Steve.
“I still can’t believe this plan actually might have worked,” Bruce adds from the other end of the coach.
for something that was out of his control. It was Tony’s decision to wield the gauntlet. He saw the opportunity and took it; not knowing his own outcomes. He wouldn’t want Peter to feel any ounce of responsibility for what happened.
The most curious thing for Steve to see was Dodger scramble off the couch, where he was receiving a petting session from Natasha, and sprint across the room to where Tony was waiting for the elevator. Steve watches as canine plants himself in front of the elevator doors as if trying to keep Tony from leaving. And from where Steve’s standing, the puppy dog eyes are murder.
“Geez, I don’t know... a night ago? I was working on gear modifications for the team, okay?” he says, defensively.
Steve blinked. He wasn’t expecting such a direct question and was caught off guard. He looked down at his hands which were clenching and unclenching with uneasiness. He had an answer, but the shame and guilt that followed were too strong to put into words. It was more than the lies between them. Tony had spelled it out that day when he took off the nanotech housing from his chest and handed it to Steve. Clearly, Tony didn’t want anything to do with him at the time.
“It’s the vet,” he says as he walks back towards the bed and sits down. He hands Steve his phone with worried eyes.
On his ninth lap, he decides to enter the park through the Artist’s Gate and takes the dwindling path to The Pond. The city is fully awake now, and the pedestrians have started to crowd the perimeter along with tourists trying to set up carriage tours with the cabbies. While the park attracts guests year-round, it’s a summer weekend, which means more people than usual are milling through the park. Steve takes a more secluded route, bright green foliage surrounding him as he makes his way towards the scenic Gapstow Bridge. He stops there for a moment to take a break and leans against the railing as he looks down at the calming pond. He counts six ducklings swimming after their mother and listens to the birds chirp away; the loud bustling sounds of the city falling out of reality for just a moment. He closes his eyes as he relishes in this small moment of illusioned respite
him; it hurt as much as not knowing whether Tony was dead or alive when Ebony Maw attacked New York, looking for the time stone, and hearing Bruce’s voice on the other end of that burner phone that Steve sent Tony with a promise that he couldn’t-
Steve breathes sharply as heat pools low in his stomach. Tony leans down slowly, closing the distance between their lips with a kiss full of desire. Steve grabs onto Tony’s hips with the full intention of flipping them both around, but fate has other plans.
It shouldn’t be such a big deal, really. It’s a simple sketch of Tony on his knees with Dodger sitting across from him, tongue sticking out and both of Tony’s hands outstretched, scratching behind his ears. He’s smiling. It’s something so mundane and normal, so Steve can’t help but not understand why Tony reacted this way.
Steve took a moment to glance at Tony’s face, and judged by his expression that he, too, was moved by the innocence evoked by his daughter.
Once he’s done getting ready for bed, he makes sure to keep his door open in case Dodger needs a drink of water during the night. He walks over to Dodger, pets him goodnight, and walks towards his bed pulling down the covers as he climbs in. He lays down and closes his eyes.
“I will be acquiring the Asgardian mead.” Thor rushes off of the couch with Bruce right on his heels.
In the meantime, Steve sketched while Tony worked, and Dodger could be found curled around his feet or having DUM-E and U chase him around—or run after him. The damn dog was probably playing the bots, too. Who knows? At first, Steve sketches Dodger. He had to, it being his first dog and all. However, at some point, sketches of Dodger turn into sketches of Dodger and Tony’s bots, and then into sketches of Dodger and Tony, until ultimately, Steve finds himself drawing just Tony.
“Hey, Dodger! What have you been doing, buddy? I’ve been looking all over for you.” He kneels to pet Dodger on the head.
a hospital. However, that should have been expected with the pitiful disguise of a sole baseball cap he was donning.
He’s safe in his bedroom in the tower, then. “JARVIS, thank you,” he says as he makes a move to get up from the bed. “What time is it?”
The eggs were soggy; the bacon, like cardboard; the toast, stale. However, Steve wasn’t expecting much.
“The weirdest thing. He was outside my lab somewhere around 5 a.m.?” Tony starts, as he gets up from the floor, walking closer to Steve. “JARVIS said you were still sleeping, and I didn’t want to wake you, so… Also, sorry about that.” He points at Steve’s forehead.
“Y’know, if you’re that worried about him, why don’t you come see him yourself? We can trade since I’ll be heading upstate to help SI start with cleanup anyway. Strange and Doctor Palmer said that his condition is stable, but he keeps going in and out of consciousness.”
Steve sighed. “Okay,” he agreed. I’ll drive myself to the city tomorrow morning. When will you be getting here?”
God, he’d blame himself for somehow convincing Tony to come back into this just to lose him in the end. Then there was the matter of his family . . .
Suddenly, Steve hears a distressed whirring sound coming from behind him. He turns to see DUM-E opening and closing his claw and lowering it towards Steve’s hand that was still holding the tennis ball.
In the next moment, Tony opened his eyes and was greeted with bright, fluorescent lighting. He blinked a couple of times for his vision to adjust to it. Then, he heard shuffling from the presence on his right, and suddenly, he saw a figure with blonde hair and azure eyes standing over him as the lights were starting to dim.
Steve makes his way up to Tony’s floor, walks through the living space and stops in front of his bedroom door that was left slightly ajar.
Steve opens his mouth to reply, but no words come out as his brain begins to catch up to what Tony just said to him. Instead, he bursts out laughing
“Well, uh, okay. This is going to sound weird, which is an understatement when it comes to him, by the way,” he nods at Dodger, who begins to roll on his back, tongue sticking out, almost in glee, as if he knew Tony was talking about him. “But I was in the kitchen, right? And he shows up and starts jumping on me and starts to pull the bottom of my pants? Like he wanted me to follow him or something. And I thought that something must be going on with you because you didn’t come up with him, and now here I am,” he finishes lamely and starts to shuffle his feet. “So…”
Steve has to look away from Tony’s wide brown eyes. He’s sure that Tony could see right through him right about now and tries to make a hasty retreat.
At the time he hadn’t questioned his actions, but as he reflected on them he couldn't help but wonder about the generous amount of time he took in assessing Tony’s condition while Pepper had to decide to run up to them and greet Tony herself. There was a slight feeling of guilt because he had felt a bit put out when she did. He had been trying to reconnect with Tony and was trying to bring him some sort of comfort due to how distraught he looked, but it should have been Pepper doing that… or Rhodes, but definitely Pepper.
“Yeah, no kidding,” Tony says as he bends down to scratch behind the dog's ear. “Look, buddy, I’ll give you a treat if you stop looking at me like that and let me go down to my lab.”
“Well, who knows how long he’s been out here or if he’s had his shots! He has no collar, which means no owners, and he needs to be taken to the dog pound!”
“I’m sorry, but he is! Look at him, jumping head-first into burning buildings like that and scaring the shit out of me in the process. Honestly! Fuck you, Rogers,” his voice cracks at the end of his sentence.
As usual, comments and feedback are always welcome. And if ya'll would like to interact with me, don't be afraid to slide into the DMs on twitter. I love to talk to fellow Stevetonies. Maybe ya'll could help me brainstorm or give me ideas for the next chapter.
“From what I could tell based on the security footage,” Tony walks over to a holographic display, “he just walked in and out of the elevator. I guess he was just lucky when he used his nose to push the bottom that got him here.”
Despite his exhaustion, this spurred Steve’s need to do something. “We-we need to get him to a hospital fast,” he urged and took a step forward.
Steve watches the video feed of Dodger doing just that and turns to look at him. Dodger stares back, his tongue happily sticking out and his tail wagging.
As he gets closer to the pond, he could hear someone shout, “Hey! Is that Captain America?!” And suddenly, a boom of loud chatter emerges and the snapping of cameras go off. From the corner of his eye, he can see that someone has taken out their phone to start recording. There’s no time, but he has the sudden urge to damage private property, take the cameras and cell phones, and crush them. He’s angry at these people who have decided to do nothing but watch.
with Dodger. Bruce had a serene smile on his face as Dodger put his head on his lap so he could pet him. Clint fed him way too many treats. Even Natasha played a game of fetch with him.
Steve shrugged, “Honestly, it’s not that bad. Besides, you’ve been here all night and this was closer than actually going out and finding a place to eat.”
The crowd begins to disperse. A few stragglers were left over, watching from a distance. Steve pays them no mind as Tony finally looks at him and closes the short distance between them.
Steve stirs to a hand softly rubbing his back. He can feel Dodger gently licking at his hand as his eyes scan the unfamiliar room and he suddenly remembers that he’s in Tony’s bedroom. He turns to face Tony, who’s looking at him with open concern.
As this realization hits him, Steve sprints from the bridge and makes his way down to the bank of the pond where a small group of people begin to gather. Not one other person made a move to help the struggling animal fighting for his life.
“Okay,” He breathes out and places a hand over his rapidly beating heart. He attempts to shake the horrible dream out of mind and takes a couple of deep breaths to bring his heart rate down. He turns his head to look out the window. It’s still dark outside.
He’s trying to keep calm, but the uncertainty of Dodger’s whereabouts eats at him. He quickly runs back into the bedroom to get a change of clothes, but when he reaches his dresser, he notices that Dodger’s leash is missing.
And he wanted to, clearly. He tried, but all he saw was a blob with strawberry blonde hair. Pepper, perhaps? His vision blacked out before completely focusing, though.
Steve had been giving him words of reassurance, but Tony was able to hear the worry in his voice; see it in the tight smile he gave him, and the doleful look in his eyes.
“Yes, Ms. Potts,” FRIDAY replied, and the nanotech reverted back to the housing, except for what was left of the damaged iron gauntlet on Tony’s right arm. “Those will need to be removed manually,” the A.I. said.
“Well, I don’t stand for anyone that partakes in animal cruelty,” he sneers. “And Stark is one of the best men I know, so you’d do well to never speak of him like that again.” If it wasn’t for the dog in his arms, he’d have grabbed this man by the front of his shirt.
I’m so sorry that this chapter took this long to post. Like I mentioned before, I was traveling, but I also started another class at uni and it so happens to be a long Saturday class where I have projects due every week up until my bday which is November 18 lol. I should have more free time to write after the 18th since both of my classes will be concluded and it’ll be the holidays. Yay! But don’t worry, I’ll continue to write in between then.
“Anyway, I should continue my rounds. I’ll be back to check on Mr. Stark in a few hours. It was good to see you again, Captain Rogers,” she said.
Steve really doesn’t know what to make of anything in this exact moment because, one, Steve could have sworn that prior to all of this, Dodger was lounging on his dog bed, and two, he couldn’t tell if this really was a coincidence or purposeful, that Tony would walk in while he was thinking of him in such a way that was beyond friendship.
“He was happy, y’know? Working with the team again,” she broke her gaze from him and looked at the window. “He didn’t explicitly say it on his nightly phone calls with me and Morgan, but I could tell. That’s not to say he wasn’t happy before, but I think that it was like something was missing for him.” She paused. “He threw himself into being a Dad to Morgan, and he’s been amazing at it.”
He and Pepper chose to sit at a table near a window that had a view of the city life. People were milling out in the busy streets, getting to where they needed to go for the day. This had been the most mundane thing Steve has ever done in a while; people watching and drinking coffee.
“Oh, no. There hasn’t been. I just came to see why there was so much noise out here,” she said. “However, Ms. Potts, on the matter of the limb-.”
Steve looked around the room until his eyes fell on the half-broken shield that he took from the wreckage. He found the other half yesterday. He hoped that it can get fixed someday - these two halves of a whole.
“What? It was faster,” Tony grins as he takes out his StarkPhone. “JARVIS, send the suit back to the tower. Tell the vet we’ll be there shortly.”
“Of course,” Tony said with a watery smile. “C’mon, let’s pinky swear it.” He held out his pinky towards Morgan. Morgan giggled and intertwined her smaller pinky with his own.
“Yeah, it’s fine. It’s only for a couple of days,” Steve said to Sam, as he put his duffle bag in the trunk of his rental. “And besides you two work better as a team, and I just really need to see how Tony’s doing.”
Ultimately, they’ve given up trying to figure out how to stop Dodger from doing this. Their planning sessions have turned into Steve hanging out in Tony’s lab while the other man works on more modifications for the team’s equipment. They bounce ideas off each other, which spurs Tony’s productivity tenfold. Not that he was never productive; he just became more focused on finishing projects than scrapping what he started and starting new ones.
Steve dropped the phone on the hotel bed and sat down. Currently, half of the Avengers and the Guardians were at the compound site to assist with their cleanup attempt. The other half, including Steve, were staying in a hotel in a small town forty-five minutes out from the compound - taking their turn to rest. It’s midday - it’s almost time for the shift change, and both Sam and Bucky should be back soon. Sam and Bucky have been getting along well; very well in fact, that Steve wasn't worried about taking off for a few days. They can help manage the team with Rhodey from here.
One out of the fourteen million six hundred five possible futures… the only one where they came out on top…
“He took the elevator,” JARVIS says simply as if it was completely normal for a dog to know how to use an elevator.
“Fine. But just for tonight,” he says sternly. Who’s he kidding, Dodger’s going to end up owning his bed. He knows it.
,” Tony rounds back on him, his expressive eyes shining. “Drive me crazy. Literally. What the fuck was that back there? I told you that the building could collapse at any minute and you just didn’t listen. Why can’t you follow a single goddamn order for once in your life?”
Steve and Tony look at each other with lingering heat, reluctant to let go. Tony sighs and gets off first and Steve sits up on the bed as he watches Tony walk towards the source of the ringing.
Rhodey’s voice ripped Steve away from his current thoughts. He and Rhodey were finishing up their conference call when Steve had asked about how Tony was doing.
Steve glances down at the dog in his arms, who in turn looks up at him with big brown eyes and attempts to lick his face again. He smiles, “I think he’s going to be okay. I’d like to take him to a vet, though.”
That seems to settle the dog in his arms, and Steve turns around to make his way out of the pond. More people with cameras had arrived, and the crowd was bigger. Ignoring them, Steve settles the dog on the ground to see if it has a collar or any injuries. He doesn’t, but he makes a move to climb back up into Steve’s arms and attempts to lick his face. “Alright, buddy,” he says with a small smile.
“Oh, did I hit a nerve?” He regards the crowd, “It looks like America’s golden boy is not only dishonorable but also a
“I could tell,” Steve said as he smiled. “He would always light up when he talked about her during team dinners. He really loves her.”
“That’s perfect, let me just cut to the chase, then. The reason why I’m calling is because a month has already passed, and I just wanted you to know that no one has claimed Dodger as theirs at the shelter. So, therefore he’s officially-”
“Well, that’s good,” said Steve, smiling back. “I’m glad that they’re letting you stay, Buck, I really am.”
“Oh. Sorry. What were you saying again?” Steve asked, shaking his head to try and clear it from his previous thoughts.
“Oh. I thought it was like, still nighttime,” he says yawning and rubbing at one of his eyes. “Well, morning Cap.”
“Pepper,” Happy quietly called out. “Why don’t you go take a break? Go get a coffee or breakfast or something. I’ll keep an eye on her.”
After Pepper left the battlefield with Stephen Strange and Dr. Palmer, the wait had been agonizing. Dr. Palmer hadn’t told her that Tony’s condition was stabilized until two days ago. He was going to be okay; however, he hadn’t fully woken up yet and had been drifting in and out of consciousness. Another matter of concern was his right arm - the radiation that the gauntlet emitted was critical for the human body, and somehow Tony came out alive, but at the cost of his right arm. Dr. Palmer had said that mobility in the right arm had been practically cut off. Tony will have to decide what he would want to do when he wakes up.
“Fuck you, you rich asshole! You won’t get away with this! People will soon realize you’re all a bunch of —”
Even so, Steve couldn’t pass up the opportunity and says with a smug smirk, “So, you were worried about me?”
“Happy advised me to go take a coffee break and get some breakfast. So, that’s where I’ll be going,” she said. “Technically, I’ve been here all night. He woke up for a second yesterday after Morgan spoke to him. I was hoping that he would do it again soon, and I wanted to be there when he did.”
“NO!” Steve shouts himself awake. There’s a sound of whimpering coming from his left and something wet nudging his cheek. He turns his head towards that direction and is met with Dodger’s face staring back at him.
“Right? I also gotta keep this guy in check,” he said as he clapped his metal hand on Sam’s shoulder. “He needs it.”
“Very well,” said Strange, “that will do.” He turned and started to wave his hands around. Tendrils of orange sparks appeared and formed a circle to open a portal to what looked like a supply closet. “I’ll be right back. I’m going to get some help. Anyone else who needs to be treated for mild injuries can come with me. Quickly.”
“I hadn’t considered that as an option,” he says as he looks down at the dog contemplatively. Maybe he would like to.
“Ha-ha, very funny,” Tony says. “Can you come up here and get this troublemaker? He won’t get off me and I’ve tried pushing him off.”
“W-wait. You’re in love with me?” Steve asks in shock, trying to wrap his mind around the other man’s words. “How?
Steve takes a hold of Tony’s hand and squeezes. He takes a deep breath and answers the call, “Hello?”
Then, there was that night when Carol Danvers rescued Tony from Space and brought him back to Earth. Pepper was already out there, watching as Captain Marvel lowered the spaceship to the ground. However, having caught that first glance of a haggard-looking Tony had Steve’s legs on autopilot, and he ran towards the ship as if his life depended on it.
Picking up the tennis ball, he turns his head in the direction of where Tony’s voice was coming from, only to find him on the floor while Dodger, followed by DUM-E, runs to greet him— or he just wants the ball in his hands.
In this case, however, he wanted to wipe it off his face. It meant something different, and he didn’t like it. That look didn’t belong there. And Tony tried to do so - tried to offer a sarcastic quip to change the expression on Steve’s face, but all he managed was half a smirk - the pain and exhaustion prevented him from conveying what he wanted to.
“Uh,” Steve coughs awkwardly. He could feel heat rushing to his face. “Tony, what are you doing here? What’s going on?”
Steve and Rhodey sprung to action. They both moved on either side of Tony and lifted him onto the stretcher. Doctor Strange and Dr. Palmer rolled the stretcher through the portal, with Pepper disassembling from her Rescue armor to follow. Steve stood with Rhodey and the rest of the Avengers as they watched the portal close behind them. He wanted to go with them, too, but the chaos that was left needed to be handled first. He just hoped that Tony would be okay.
“Yeah, it looks like someone got it on video and sent it to your employers,” Tony shrugs nonchalantly. “I would also find a different place to go on your small-minded walks, because you’re banned from Central Park for, let me see here, life!”
Of course, that peaceful slumber doesn’t last because that’s not how Steve’s life works. JARVIS wakes them up a few hours later.
“I hope you know,” Tony starts, “that it was a mutual break up, but that's beside the point. The CPP are on their way here to escort a former Central Park employee off the premises for kicking a defenseless dog into a pond, causing such a disturbance for park-goers, and the cherry on top, verbally harassing Captain America.”
Steve looked at Pepper to acknowledge her. There was an unreadable expression on her face. He could tell that she was examining him; but for what, he didn’t know.
“It’ll be fine. Just take a few minutes to yourself. Rhodey’s not the only one who deserves a break, y’know?” He paused. “Also, the kid texted me to tell me that he’s going to stop by after school today.”
“Honestly, ‘Tasha? It’s too late. Tell Thor I need five fingers of that mead, I’d like to blackout now.”
“Right,” she paused, a faraway look in her eyes. “Hopefully he fully wakes up soon to decide. However, I highly recommend it, since it’ll basically be a dead limb.”
“Yeah, yeah,” he waves him off and steps out of the elevator. He looks towards the direction of the kitchen. “Did you just make fresh coffee? You never make coffee.”
Don’t even get him started on the way Tony interacts with Dodger. If it was possible to melt into a puddle of mushy goo, he wouldn’t be here right now.
“Tony, when was the last time you went to bed?” Steve asks, trying to mask the accusatory tone of his voice.
I’m also open to prompts if anyone wants to suggest something that has nothing to do with this fic. I really want to apply for the stevetony zine but I don’t have enough samples of my work to show them. So yeah, prompts would be so cool!
“I see. Well, Happy wasn’t wrong. You should go take a break.” He paused for a moment and said, “Do you mind if I tagged along? I could go for some coffee, too. I didn’t stop for breakfast on my way here.”
“Okay,” she said and proceeded to babble on about the hotel pancakes she had this morning, which, she figured, were shaped into an ambiguous animal.
“Alright Dodger, c’mon. Time to go,” he says as he tries to pull his dog off of Tony. Dodger groans and lets himself be pushed off, but as soon as Steve lets go of him, he scrambles to get back on top of Tony.
They’ve tried literally everything to keep Dodger from leaving Steve’s floor. They’ve set up alerts (they never went off), fences with a smart lock (Dodger probably laughed —yeah,
Steve startles and puts himself on high alert. His eyes move rapidly across the pond to locate where the disturbance came from. They land on a figure splashing without control and desperation, whimpering sounds coming from it. It’s a dog and it can’t swim.
“I’ll probably be flying up there later tonight to have time to get me and Barnes ready for that conference call with the new Secretary of State and the UN for tomorrow morning. By the way, I’ll let Pepper know you’ll be on your way here tomorrow. Do you need a place to say?”
“It’ll be fine. Steve,” Rhodey paused and let out a loud sigh. “I can’t sit here and watch my best friend just lay there and not be able to do anything about it. It kills me to see him like this. Even Pepper told me I should take a break. I honestly don’t want to leave him, but I keep thinking,
“Cap! I’ve got a nuke coming in, and I know just where to put it,” Tony’s voice replaces Peggy’s on the radio, and suddenly he’s back in the Quinjet. “Tony?” Steve breathes out, and all he can do is helplessly watch the Iron Man armor fly past him underneath the belly of a nuclear missile aiming towards the portal.
“Do you mean the trails of peanut butter we had to strategically place to lure Dodger around?” Bruce asks, laughing.
Steve’s fully awake now. He shoots up into a sitting position and looks around to see if he could spot Dodger anywhere in his room even though he knows he’s not there. He looks towards his bedroom door, which he kept closed but unlocked last night and finds it wide open.
“Depending on how cleanup goes and when the help arrives, I might drag these two with me back to the city,” said Rhodey. “I heard from Clint that Wanda will be visiting him for a bit and then they’ll visit Tony at the hospital along with his family.”
“Honestly? I think you should,” Tony says with a slight smile. “Anyway, you can think it over more on the way back to the tower, Happy’s waiting for us in the car.”
“Oh.” Tony nods and then shifts his gaze down towards Dodger who has moved past the doorway and is now lying on the ground between them.
“Hi, sweetheart,” greeted Pepper as Morgan approached her. She reached her arms out to embrace her daughter and lifted her onto her lap.
“No… I’m just very sleep deprived. You know what they say about operating heavy machinery and all of that,” he absentmindedly waves his hand around and takes a seat on the floor and Steve follows suit.
Tony’s eyes narrow slightly, and before he knows it Tony is looming on top of him, legs on either side of his waist, hands pinning his shoulders to the bed. There’s a devilish smirk on his face.
Steve is caught between sputtering and laughing and brings a hand over to gently move Dodger’s face from his.
Pepper finally took a good look at him. She could see the wariness in his eyes. Before she convinced Rhodey to take off, he was always on the phone with someone, which she eventually learned to be Steve. Rhodey had been updating Steve on Tony’s condition, constantly, even when there was no news to give. He even told her that Steve didn’t think he should be here in the first place, and that would be another issue to unpack in the laundry list of issues that Steve and Tony have had with each other. However, standing in front of him, now, she could tell that he cared, deeply - just like he did five years ago when he found out that there was a small chance that Tony might have survived.
Steve watches in shock as Tony steps out of the armor, face twisted in a murderous glare as he walks towards the groundskeeper who continues to stand his ground, but is starting to look like he’d like to be anywhere but here.
Steve wakes up slowly, feeling well-rested. There’s a light weight on his chest and a long line of warmth by his side. He feels hair tickling the side of his face and a leg intertwined with his.
Natasha smirks, “Well, I’m glad you got a new friend out of this,” she says. “Oh, Tony? Pepper called me to tell you that you better stop avoiding her and call her back or else she’s coming by tomorrow. Something about the display at the park.”
Steve takes a deep breath and sighs as he listens to the sound of Tony’s heart beating. It begins to soothe him so he closes his eyes and tries to match his breathing with Tony’s while the other man runs his fingers through Steve’s hair.
Steve thinks as he breaks them apart for a moment, snaking a hand behind Tony’s neck to tug him forward touching their foreheads together. He looks deeply into those big, beautiful, brown eyes he loves so much and says, “I’m in love with you too.”
“I’m not the one who tripped and fell earlier ‘cause they didn’t notice the poor, alien tree guy sticking his leg out. I think you dented his branch a bit. He seemed pretty upset.”
“Are you threatening me, Captain?” He raises his voice so everyone could hear. “The honorable Captain America is threatening me for doing my job to keep the park safe for guests. I’d expect this from Tony fucking Stark since he’s an arrogant prick, but you?” He scoffs. “You’re not so honorable, are you? I thought you were a hero for the common people.”
That’s what Tony had said to him five years ago, with spite laced into his words; it was meant to hurt, and it did hurt. It
Steve wakes with a loud gasp, as if desperately trying to replace the phantom feeling of having water-filled lungs. His hair is matted, stuck to his forehead, and his sleepshirt is coated in a thin layer of cold sweat clinging to his skin. He takes a few breaths to calm his rapidly beating heart and starts to take in his surroundings.
“No, wait. Tony, I’m fine,” Steve insists. He’s about to say something else but Tony cuts him off with a glare.
He tries to respond, he really does, but the weight of the rubble, the ash, and soot is all too much and his vision goes dark.
What do you guys think so far? At least Tony’s awake, finally! Is there anything y’all would like for me to include in this fic. Any little moments between stevetony, or something you guys want to happen between them? I’m open to suggestions.
“Strange has them secured at his place with that weird magic that he does,” replied Rhodey. “He said to let him know when we’re ready to return them.”
They’re laying there in silence with Dodger in between them. Steve is stock still. He wants to get closer since this is definitely the only chance he’ll ever get to sleep in the same bed as Tony, but he can’t. They’re just friends. It’s probably for the best that he doesn’t get a taste of the closeness he craves. He’s not sure he’d be able to go back to sleeping alone.
“I had to go in there and get him, and see him lying unconscious and bloody under a mountain of rubble…” Tony sighs deeply to himself. “When are you going to get it through your thick head that we need you?
He’s not sure anymore as the environment around him shifts between the old technology of the forties and the newer technology of the 21st century.
“Who’s a smart dog?” She coos as she gives him those behind the ear scratches she knows are his favorite.
“No, it’s okay, JARVIS. I just need to go out for a run,” he says in a rush. He changes into some sweats and a t-shirt. He needs to clear his head and he doesn’t need to unload his nightmares onto Tony Stark.
Also, I did want to mention that this is NOT a home wrecker Steve fic, or an anti pepperony fic or anti Pepper fic. I have a plan for that but I don’t want to spoil it. Anyway I love Queen Pepper.
Pepper sighed as she let go of Tony’s hand. A wave of emotion washed over her and tears welled up in her eyes. She was grateful. Honestly. He was alive and he brought everyone back - banished the nightmare that had been plaguing his mind for over ten years. If only he would wake up.
Pepper forced a reassuring smile. Those eyes were definitely her father’s. “No, baby. He didn’t. He’s still sleeping.”
Rhodey relayed information back to Steve and the rest of the group that cleanup for the destruction that Thanos left behind will start by the end of the week; Pepper told him during his latest visit to the hospital that Stark Industries will be partnering up with the government to oversee the job. What was left of the Avengers and the Guardians helped with what they could. King T’Challa even offered some of his resources to help. Steve was grateful for his assistance.
Natasha sits on one of the couches in the communal floor with Bruce and Thor as they wait for Clint to report back. From the other side of the room, the elevator dings and out walks Dodger, tail happily wagging behind him. Natasha motions him to come forward and he runs up to her, climbs onto the couch and lays his head on her lap.
Dodger takes the opportunity to lie his head on his chest and Steve pets him, the motion soothing both him and Dodger.
It’s evening when Steve returns from Dodger’s last walk for the night. He leads Dodger out of the elevator when they reach his floor. They make it through his bedroom door where Dodger has a brand-new orthopedic pet bed that he jumps on as soon as he sees it.
Steve groans as excruciating pain shoots all over his body. The smoke is making his eyes water and he feels it filling up his lungs as he gasps for nonexistent, clean air.
“Sir!” Steve sees the man physically flinch before turning around. He gets closer to him and stares him down. “Would you happen to know what happened to this dog and if he has any owners?”
Steve, even though he felt like he was intruding (which was exactly what he feared was going to happen), smiled at the bittersweet sight in front of him. He was happy for them. Tony was finally able to be with his family without the heavy weight of remorse and regret that he had felt for not having tried hard enough on behalf of the rest of the world that “blipped” out of existence.
He rushes into the pond with little regard for his clothes that are getting soaked. The water comes up to his waist as he waddles through it. He makes calming noises and murmurs reassuring words to the thrashing animal as he positions his arms under it to scoop it out of the water. The medium-sized dog, soaking wet with a matted mix of honey brown and white fur, makes a move to nearly climb over Steve but finds purchase within his arms. It’s trembling, but Steve runs a calming hand over its fur as he softly says, “It’s okay, buddy. I gotcha. It’s okay.”
“There hasn’t been much change. Unless…?” Pepper looked at Dr. Palmer for clarification, since she wasn’t sure if her appearance was coincidental or not.
“‘Responsible’ is his middle name. He’ll take good care of him,” Tony pipes up and Steve sends him a slightly exasperated look.
“Are you sure? Not that I’m doubting that you’ll take good care of him, but adopting a dog is a pretty big responsibility.”
Groaning in exasperation, Steve brings his head down to hold it between his hands as Tony drapes an arm around his shoulders and kisses his temple before bursting into laughter.
It was like an out of body experience at the time, because of the pain, but he remembered watching Pepper, clad in the blue Rescue armor, her eyes full of worry, scanning his body, and kneeling down close to him, whispering words of comfort.
Steve doesn’t know what to say, but he watches Tony’s expression shift into one of determination, like he’s made up his mind about something.
After all that they’ve been through, working with Tony again these past few weeks and saving the world from Thanos had been the most alive Steve had ever felt since before the situation with Bucky and the Accords. It felt good to be on the same side as Tony. There was always something there when they worked together; something that made them better and overcome anything that felt impossible. They worked flawlessly; able to communicate what the other is thinking and coming up with the same ideas by using as few words as possible.
Steve turned around and saw Doctor Stephen Strange make his way towards them, cloak billowing behind him as we walked. Steve looked at him in confusion and was about to protest but Strange cut him off with, “We need to remove the armor first. Then I can transport him to the hospital.”
“Yeah, yeah. I’ve heard worse. And I think that’s plenty of hate speech for one day,” Tony dismisses the insults and regards the crowd as the groundskeeper gets taken away, “Alright, people, the show’s over. Go do... whatever it was you all were doing.”
“Anyway, I took him out on a walk.” Tony continues, “I guess that’s what he wanted since he brought his leash with him.”
Steve rouses to a dull feeling of pain and the sound of monitors beeping. He can make out a voice talking.
“Maguna,” he lifted his left hand, placed it on Morgan’s head and ruffled her hair while giving her the most reassuring smile he could muster. “Go and get a snack with Uncle Happy. I’ll still be here when you get back.”
The nurses dispersed and backed away from the Captain, each of them scurrying away to resume their work, their faces blushing furiously. The Captain was left in bewilderment, probably not expecting such a reaction
As the doors close, Steve can still see Tony watching him with an indiscernible expression on his face that almost looks like worry.
She sniffed and said, “God, Tony. I was so worried.” She closed her eyes and held Tony’s hand tightly with her own.
“I know you’re out there! You can come in, y’know.” He could hear Tony call out from behind the door. Steve pushes the door open and is met with the sight of Tony laying on his stomach and Dodger draped across his back.
“Okay. I’ll go downstairs to get some breakfast.” She nudged her daughter,” Hey, baby. Mommy’s going to go get something to eat, okay? I’ll be right back, and be good for Uncle Happy, okay?”
“But you’re right. It’s not that bad,” she continued. “I’ve had worse.” A small smile appeared on her lips.
Steve was picking at his scrambled eggs when he decided to voice his thoughts on how bland this was for him - as an attempt for small talk - when he saw the grimace on Pepper’s face as she looked down at his breakfast and then her own.
There was a knock on the door before it opened and Dr. Palmer entered. “Oh, Mr. Stark. You’re awake,” said Dr. Palmer as she walked into the room. “This is great. We were hoping you’d wake up soon. I’m Dr. Christine Palmer, by the way.”
to his owner’s emotions,” he says as he reaches out to scratch behind the dog's ear one last time before stepping into the elevator.
As she passed by the nurse’s station, which was by the elevators, she heard a loud commotion coming from the opposite direction. She saw other nurses turn their heads to the source of it, and she couldn't help but do the same.
Rhodey then addressed Steve, “Oh, before I forget. Pepper called. Doctor Palmer told her that there’s a very low chance that Tony’s right arm will have an inch of mobility. So,” he handed Steve a StarkPad. “I had to stop by the lake house to pick this up. FRIDAY’s hooked up to that. He’s going to need it once he fully wakes up. It’ll probably keep him entertained while he’s there - give him something to do, y’know.”
“I’m positive,” he says and adds a reassuring smile for good measure. “Anyway, I’m going to go for a run, I’ll be back later. Call me if you need me!” He turns to get into the elevator and doesn’t hesitate to press the ‘close door’ button just in case Tony tries to dig some more.
And just as he heard the tapping of Pepper’s heels coming closer, he opened his mouth and groggily said, “Steve?”
“Yes, but it wasn’t always like that. The first year was hard, before Morgan. He wasn’t able to rest; he had nightmares of when everyone disappeared. It was like the wormhole all over again.”
He gives a curious glance at Dodger but doesn’t address his suspicions because one thing is your dog being attuned to your feelings, another thing is your dog literally playing matchmaker, which sounds insane.
“Happy, could you take Morgan to get a snack, please?” interrupted Pepper, sending a pointed look towards Happy and then Tony.
“Great!” Tony exclaims. “Also, could you make those pancakes you made for the team brunch we had two weeks ago, later?”
If they start to become something more, the only thing that would change would be the physical aspect of their relationship. They already spend a lot of time together; they go out to eat together; watch movies alone together (Tony wanted to catch him up on the classics and said that he would take it upon himself to educate him since everyone else on the team watched them already – which Steve will soon realize that this logic was flawed because
“Bruce told me that he and Rocket will be consulting with Hank Pym tomorrow to get the resources they’re missing to build a new quantum tunnel. So, I guess that it’s only a matter of time until we can send those back.”
Steve carried the dog through the elevators and up to the communal floor where, as Tony had said, a vet waited for their arrival with a steel medical grade table. The vet checked the dog over for any injuries but found none. She advised that he just needed food, water, rest, and some medication for fleas, ticks, and heartworm prevention as well as some additional vaccines just to be safe. Tony nods along as she explains all this to them, giving her the go-ahead to do what she needs to for the dog.
“Yeah, we all need each other, and we all need to be there for one another,” Steve said in agreement.
“Well, I just want to make sure you understand, Captain, that if the owner does turn up within the month and the shelter doesn’t find anything wrong when it investigates the circumstances behind this dog being at the park, you will have to surrender the dog to them.”
I would also like to know if you guys think that the character interactions are flowing naturally. It's kind of hard to write certain characters interacting when they've never interacted on screen before.
Pepper Potts sat in the blanched hospital room, willing Tony Stark’s comatose body to open its eyes. She held his hand, hoping to feel a tightening of the slack grip, or a brush of a finger upon her own. The only proof that Tony Stark was still alive was the steady beeping of the heart monitor and the rise and fall of his chest.
“No one has ever drawn me like this. Actually, no one has ever drawn me, period. I’m just having a hard time wrapping my head around the way you did.”
Sam nodded, “Well, that’s good. We all need each other, too. More than ever. There’s no room for fights. Especially since we’ve lost really good people.”
All chattering ceases and most of the people shake their heads ‘no’. From the corner of his eye, he sees a burly man in a groundskeeper uniform try to blend in with the crowd to make an exit. He narrows his eyes and projects his next words onto him.
And Steve can’t help but feel somewhat relieved at hearing that. The dog won’t suffer the chance to go back to terrible owners who either left him at the park or weren’t actively looking for him. This dog deserves better, and so does
Steve bites his lip, contemplating. It’s not that he can’t, clearly. It’s just the various solo subject drawings of Tony that he would rather not show him.
Thinking back on that, and he must have been delirious at the time, he had a vague memory of that asshole, the cryptic doctor with his stupid, billowing, sentient cloak, portaling out and coming back with a female doctor friend…
The only reason why they started spending so much time together was because of Dodger. If Dodger hadn’t come into their lives, they would’ve continued having civil conversations as housemates and teammates but not as the friends they are now. Steve would’ve stayed the same, alone and trying to assimilate into his new life.
“Awake?” she asked, softly. Her brown eyes, just like her father’s, held a certain type of unease in them and it nearly broke Steve’s heart. If things hadn’t worked out as they did - Steve didn’t even want to think about how the repercussions could have affected Tony’s family.
“Why don’t you try talking to him again, baby?” Pepper urged on. “I think he heard you last time.” The last time Tony had gained consciousness was after Morgan had her talking session with him, but Pepper had Happy take her back to the hotel suite - that she booked for their stay in the city until Tony recovered - before she was able to see the fruits of her labor. Pepper had watched as Tony had opened his eyes for a brief second and a slight smile appear on his face. The moment was short, but Pepper knew that Tony was still listening.
“I mean, now it makes sense!” The man continues, “No wonder Pepper Potts broke up with Tony Stark months ago. Probably, caught them both—”
“Okay, Happy. We’ll be on our way up. Bye.” Pepper finished the call with a concerned look on her face and started to gather her things to leave.
Pepper and Christine smiled ruefully at each other. Resilience was what kept the men in their lives going.
Steve nodded, turned back to Tony and watched as Pepper referred back to the A.I. once again. “FRIDAY, could you please remove the armor?” she quietly asked.
“We’re on really good terms, Sam, and I’d like to keep it that way,” said Steve as he shut the trunk of the car and faced Sam.
Exhausted and close to collapsing, Steve Rogers looked at the sight around him. Total destruction had reigned after Thanos and his army attacked, but it was finally over. The dust settled and he watched as one by one of Thanos’s lackeys turned into ash, carried off by the silent wind until ultimately the Titan himself was also no more. As the relief was starting to wash over him, it was cut short when his eyes caught Tony Stark by the rubble, struggling to stay upright. He watched in uncertainty as Tony collapsed. He immediately wanted to reach out and help him, but he was yards away from him. Steve eyed the damage caused by the gauntlet that Tony used to banish Thanos from existence. Like Bruce, he could see that Tony’s right side had been charred due to the power of the Infinity Stones that flowed through the gauntlet.
Steve chuckled and said, “I haven’t had the pleasure of trying his cooking. He usually ordered takeout for the team.”
“Y’know, when I saw ‘Captain America Rescues Dog’ trending on Twitter, I thought it was going to be cute or whatever, which it was by the way. Very wholesome. I just didn’t think it was going to result in you almost punching some guy if Tony hadn’t stepped in,” Natasha quips at him. “He would have deserved it.”
Steve and Sam were standing behind Steve’s rental car as he prepared for the drive to New York City. They were waiting for Bucky and Rhodey to catch up to them. They both had been attending a conference call with the United Nations and King T’Challa, finishing up. Secretary Ross had stepped down from the United Nations’ panel that dealt with the Accords five years ago and was replaced by someone else far more fair and willing to listen to the Avengers and their concerns. They even settled to have the status of the rogue Avengers wiped completely clean, namely Steve, Sam and Wanda’s, due to their assistive efforts to help save the world. Bucky’s situation is pretty much up in the air, but with King T’Challa and Princess Shuri vouching for him and his recovery, Bucky will be able to remain on American soil without the fear of getting arrested, as long as he’s being escorted by Rhodes or any other Avenger that had signed the original document. As for the Accords having any official ground on whether the Avengers will operate within the UN’s panel, well, that discussion has been tabled and will continue to be until the world recovers from this intergalactic blow. The UN panel, King T’Challa, and Rhodey, as the new liaison, have figured that restrictions will do more harm than good with the world’s current state.
Morgan’s voice interrupted his thoughts and reminded him that he had yet to reply, so he stowed away the past, smiled and said, “Hey, Tony. How are you feeling?”
A minute later he hears the sound of paws pattering on the floor, approaching him. He turns his head towards the sound and opens one eye just in time to see Dodger bring his face closer to his to lick him.
Steve, still trying to process what Tony just said to him, blinks himself out of a trance to find that the elevator doors have already closed in his face as it takes Tony to his lab.
“I’d like to see you try to let go of me first,” he shoots back, knowing fully well that Tony doesn’t intend to do so.
He looks ahead, ice stretches out for miles, but in the middle of it all there’s a portal and a hoard of aliens are coming out of it.
Pepper watched as Steve Rogers was swarmed by nurses, both women and men, asking questions upon questions. Some continued to gush over him. Others had gotten closer to him than what was deemed necessary in an attempt to touch his leather-clad biceps. Pepper stood there, speechless at the spectacle; that is until Dr. Christine Palmer arrived at the scene.
“Well, I guess it doesn’t even matter anymore, does it? And you’re here now, right? It’s better than never. And it looks like you two are on better terms,” she said with a slight smile. “Despite everything that happened between the two of you, and anything he would say regarding that, I think he forgave you a long time ago, Steve. In fact, I think he ne-” Pepper was cut off by the sound of her phone ringing. She quickly took it out and said, “It’s Happy.”
Unfortunately, awkward situations follow Steve like the plague. There was that time during the war when he thought Peggy and Howard were something more behind closed doors, and he had felt that burst of jealousy coursing through his veins, to the point of having a confrontation with Peggy. Definitely not his proudest moment.
“Thank you! You, too,” he hangs up and turns back to Tony. “Y’know, I forgot about those conditions before she called.”
“He’s just a dog!” Steve scoffs, raising his voice. Suddenly, he feels the dog in his arms flinch, so Steve tries to calm himself down. The dog doesn’t need this on top of his trauma.
The next time Steve awakens, it’s 7 a.m. and his bed is empty. Steve groggily gets up and looks around the bedroom. “Dodger?” He calls out.
“Really Cap, you wound me! Besides we’re talking about fixing your Dodger issue, not my admittedly unhealthy sleeping habits.”
He should also consider that it wasn’t necessarily his fault that he was the first person that Tony saw when he finally decided to wake up.
“Yeah, well…” Tony splutters, seemingly unable to take the compliment. “Cap seriously, it’s your call. Just don’t go around naming him after mythical gods or Thor will try to spar with him
But instead he says, “This is exactly how I see you, Tony.” It’s close enough. He clears his throat and tears his eyes away from him. “So, I’m not done with the rest of these, but when the time comes, I’ll show you. Deal?”
“However, if we do find out who the owner is,” the vet continues as she pulls out the scanner, “the shelter won’t release the dog to them immediately. We have to find out why he’s been stranded in the park for so long.” She holds the device against the dog’s right side, and then to the left and mutters, “Damn.”
Tony’s gaze shifted from Pepper to Steve in acknowledgment. Steve could see that Tony was trying to say something, moving his lips to form the words, but Steve placed a hand on his leg and said, “Don’t, Tony. Save your strength.”
The majority of the ride back to the tower was silent. Mostly because, within a few minutes, the dog curled up on Steve’s lap and fell asleep with his long, fluffy tail lying on Tony’s leg. There seemed to be a silent, mutual agreement that they should not wake the dog up. When they finally got to the tower Steve didn’t have the heart to move and disturb the dog, but he did while Tony shot him a sympathetic look.
“I just have a feeling Tony will have a pretty big say on what he’d like to do. I’m not going to take that decision away from him,” she said. What he’s been through… It’s traumatic enough. I think it’s time for him to take back control over his life.”
“Oh, yeah, laugh it up, big guy,” Tony says attempting to sound annoyed but failing. Steve can hear him grinning through the phone, trying to keep himself from joining Steve in laughing.
“No way. But thanks for the coffee, Cap! You’re a lifesaver,” he says as he makes his way down the hall. He stops for a moment and turns back around to face Steve. “Hey, you alright?”
Tony breaks the silence. “Is that really me?” he asks in a small voice, not taking his eyes away from the drawing.
Steve feels his pulse quicken at Tony’s last statement. And now he can hear it as his heart monitor starts beeping rapidly.
In the distance, he heard the murmuring of voices. They were talking about him. He felt warmth and softness surrounding him and a tiny pressure on his hand. Someone was holding it.
“Uh-huh. If that was the case, you’d actually go to bed at a reasonable hour instead of tinkering down here for more than half the day.”
Morgan’s expression fell. “Oh,” she said. She then turned her face towards her father. She reached out with her tiny hand to grasp the hand that Pepper had been holding previously.
“Well, we will take him to a shelter and hope someone adopts him. And honestly, who wouldn’t? He’ll get snagged up quick just with the publicity from today alone. Also, look at that cute face,” she coos as the dog wags his tail.
Even so, Steve takes a glance at the crowd calculatingly. He chooses his next words carefully as he regards the rude man.
Steve's thoughts come to a sudden halt. He slams his sketchbook shut just as Tony walks through his bedroom door with a confused look on his face and Dodger behind his legs, nudging them to keep him walking forward.
Twitter: @ircnshield *DONT HESITATE TO COME YELL AT ME TO WRITE. Or talk to me about stevetony... or deancas 👀? (Any DeanCas stans out there? Lol how about that last episode, 15.03? big OOF. I’m also thinking about writing a coda/fix it for that lol)
,” the man says snidely, giving up the act, “has been a nuisance around here! And I have been trying to get someone out here to get rid of him. He’s a danger to park guests and personnel!”
Some of the fighters left with Strange. Wong also instructed the rest to open portals to have those that were wounded pass through and clear the field. The only ones left were the Guardians and the Avengers. The portal that Strange had opened, closed, and Steve turned back to Tony and knelt forward next to Pepper.
?” He scoffs in disbelief. “Do you know how many times you say that when I know you’re really not? God, Steve.” Tony starts pacing and Steve takes a quick glance at Dodger who stares back at him before lowering his body onto the ground with a small growl.
“Seriously? You don’t want me naming things, especially living, breathing, furry ones. I suck at naming things. I mean, look at U and DUM-E, they have to live with those names for the rest of their robot lives.”
- gaunt and malnourished, like he was a step away from death’s door - when he got off the Benator, gutted him. He couldn’t run fast enough to get to him, the ill filled past and arguments behind him. And now, Tony was in the middle of fighting for his life once again.
“Captain Rogers, I sensed that you were experiencing a night terror and tried to awaken you, as you requested.”
“And Steve Rogers should be on his way… Both of them are going to tell me to go take a nap, aren’t they?” she said dejectedly.
Sighing deeply, Steve opens his eyes and sees Tony’s disheveled bedhead, his arm curled around the other man’s chest with a hand resting gently over his sternum. Steve smiles and tightens his hold around Tony’s waist.
However, the information that Steve had been itching to hear the most is about Tony’s road to recovery. Any time Rhodey would call him and give him an update about the cleanup efforts, he didn’t have much positive news on Tony’s condition, and Steve hadn't seen Tony since Doctor Strange took him to the hospital in New York City via portal two days ago.
It’s quiet on the common floor since no one was awake yet. He brews a pot of coffee as he makes himself a breakfast sandwich. As the coffee finishes brewing, Steve grabs a travel mug from one of the cupboards and prepares the coffee to his liking, leaving half of the pot full, and wraps his breakfast sandwich up to take with him. He grabs a few protein bars and stuffs them in his bag on his way out to the elevator.
Tony groans. “Yeah, that’s not going to be fun,” he grimaces. “Alright, well, can’t keep her waiting.”
Was he dead? Maybe. Tony remembered what happened in flashes. He recalled putting on the gauntlet, pain, snapping his fingers, Thanos disappearing, and more pain. And really, despite the pain, he felt at peace knowing that his nightmare was finally over.
Tony reaches forward attempting to gather the other man in his arms. Steve can’t resist the pull of being close to Tony and the comfort of being held, so he goes along with it. He presses his face against Tony’s chest, where the arc reactor emits a warm glow through the soft, black cotton of Tony’s tank top and brings his arm up to clutch tightly at Tony’s waist.
“Well, considering that he doesn’t have a collar or a chip, probably very slim. That normally means that the previous owners just wanted to get rid of him.”
