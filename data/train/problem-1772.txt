if you didn’t shoot us as we’re trying to save you, thanks,” the voice of the first man who had approached the door came from my other side and took hold of me as James let me go. It held a slight lilt and poise in it, even in its urgency. I could not see the face of its owner through the smoke, however James seemed to believe it to be safe as I could see him leaning on another man through the haze. So I took a deep breath, took the hand offered to me and let myself be led outside the burning inferno.
This marks the beginning of act two! There are just ten chapters left now, and I hope you all enjoy.
“London is my home. I have lived there for nearly two decades now. Of course, it is no easy task to abandon my life and my profession for an effort that may not work. I was contemplating the reality of it just moments before you knocked on my door. But, if you are so willing to sacrifice your life’s work—your career, your reputation—in replacement for a life of secluded retirement all for an attempt to save one man, then how could I do anything but follow you?”
I nearly ran into James’ back, who was frozen in place several steps outside the cottage’s garden gate. I opened my mouth to ask but I did not need to—for just outside, in the middle of the country road, I could see Miranda, clinging to Thomas Hamilton as if her life depended on it.
“All this time…” James murmured to himself, seemingly lost in his own memories. I was uncertain if whatever else Holmes said would even be heard by the poor man, yet he continued all the same.
Before Holmes could begin to explain how such a drastic effort could be accomplished—freeing Thomas would be no easy feat, I was certain, and there was of course the matter of finding him before all else—there was a loud
“Quite so. I understand one of Lord Ashe’s friends had been your landlord-in-absentia in America. At the time, you had no reason to be suspicious of this—for all you knew, Peter Ashe was still a friend to the Hamiltons, who was simply looking to help you in a terrible situation. Yet, this was his way of keeping an eye on you, making sure you would not act in a way that would endanger his position. When he heard word that you were en route to Glasgow, he assumed that you had found out the truth of his dealings and he made arrangements for intelligence on your movements, and attempts on your lives.”
A faint sob wretched from Holmes’ throat at that, and it was only then that I noticed the wetness upon my own cheeks. There was a deep exhaustion weighing on my bones, and I wanted nothing more than to take the man next to me into my arms and never release him.
Despite the scandalous nature of the young Lord’s words, Judge Reynolds appeared to trust Hamilton’s testimony—as did the jury. After two hours deliberation, the commonwealth jurors reached the conclusion that Viscount Wilfred Henderson was GUILTY of robbery and libel against Mr. Angus Perry.
in the manner I thought him to be suggesting. His expression was grim, with no whisper of humour behind it, as he met James’ pained stare. Was Holmes capable of it? Was he capable of murdering a man so devilish as Peter Ashe? Without a doubt in my mind, he was. He had done much the same to Professor Moriarty, and to Charles Augustus Milverton—though I may have reported differently on that matter. However, it was not something he did with a light hand. To kill another was something Sherlock Holmes did when no other option existed, and in this moment, I was convinced it was true of Lord Ashe.
“If I tell Holmes I must rescind my involvement, I cannot confirm he will not be able to discover the true reason,” I replied. A knowing, pained nod from my wife followed. “Besides, with your knowledge of the Hamiltons’ personal lives, and Holmes’ detection abilities, perhaps we can work this in our favour.”
“If that is how you feel, Holmes, then I see no issue before us.” He looked up at me again from where his eyes peered at the floorboards, and there was the same glimmer of excitement in his eyes that I saw all those years ago in Bart’s Hospital. Now, it was tinged with exhaustion, his face now more lined, and a risk of imprisonment or death at the end of this plan loomed over us. And yet, as his lips curled into a smile I had missed so deeply, I could not find it within myself to care for fear or rage anymore.
“I could have done more to protect you, if I had not been so selfish, and yet you understand my motivation better than any other.”
Sherlock turns back toward him, and is faced with a kind expression he still cannot comprehend in its entirety. The expression is much the same as the one he saw five years ago, when all of this began, and then another memory passes through Sherlock’s mind.
Later, Silver left us to our lodgings to continue his work about the tavern, as James and I remained in the darkened room. He settled himself onto a chair next to the window, clearly with no intention of sleeping. After some silence, I looked at him, his face looking ghostly as it was illuminated by the moonlight.
“This evening appears to be full of intriguing points, Watson. Our hosts are rather as our client described, and yet the atmosphere tonight lacks the animosity and wickedness I was led to expect. The Earl referred to the young Lord as stubborn and foolhardy, as you may remember, and while I can see how that assessment may be true of him—much in a way that can be true of myself—I fail to see him use it in any malicious way. I admit, while I find his views on Poplarism rather lacking, he is clearly an intelligent man and does not strike me as one to be deceived easily.” He spoke in a hush to me, to keep our discussion covert in nature. I stole a look toward McGraw, whose stare met my own as I nodded in affirmation of Holmes’ words. I was left with the uncomfortable feeling that, although Holmes and I were a good distance away from him and our voices were hushed, he could hear every word we were saying.
“It is at the end of a dirt road on the outskirts of the city, and should be marked with a sign labeling it as
“Of course! I was about to deliver a letter to the post office if you wish to accompany me,” I offered, welcoming her into the room while I fetched my coat and boots.
He went over the locations of all potentially armed guards on the property, present to protect the high profile guests the home so often housed. He went over how we were to enter the facility unseen, and sneak into the private room of Alfred Hamilton while going unnoticed. Silver joined in with an explanation for a door in the fence, an old back exit, now hidden among swathes of shrubbery.
The Lord waved a hand. “Please. We do not stand on ceremony in this house. Do call me Thomas. Lord Hamilton is my father, and the title does make me feel rather beyond my age.” I did not miss the sharp sour tone of his voice when he mentioned his father, however the shadow of it was gone as soon as it had appeared. “And there is no need to be bashful, Dr. Watson! I assure you, there are no strident minds within these walls tonight. We hold these gatherings so that voices can roam free without the yoke of shame on their shoulders.” The casual informality of his words gave the impression that the remarks he had made regarding my chronicling habits now held little weight in his mind. He spoke as though every new thought was of equal significance to the one before.
The cadence with which John Silver spoke was one that forced you to listen, and did so much as to convince you that listening was the sole option available to you. Every eye in our party was upon him, though James’ appeared lidded and heavy beneath his usual attentiveness. It appeared as if he did not want to show how closely his ears were attuned to the words coming from his younger friend, yet someone who had seen him listen to the words of Thomas Hamilton could pinpoint it in an instant.
“Please meet me upstairs in five minutes to discuss the schematics of tonight,” was all he said. I complied without hesitation. After finishing my chapter, and placing my empty mug at the bar, I ventured upstairs to the room not occupied by Mary and Miranda. Inside, I found James and Silver seated around a small round table, most likely brought up from the tavern. Atop it lay what looked like a map, as well as various other documents I could not read from my place at the door.
On the subject of James McGraw, it was made clear to me over the course of the evening that Thomas felt nothing but deep respect and admiration for his advisor. When he spoke of their work—a project McGraw was advising him on, one which Thomas could not share the sensitive details about—or his readings on philosophy, or his thoughts on the Whigs’ latest act in government, Thomas’ sentences would often begin with “James thinks …” or “James would say …”. He recollected the events of his very first meeting with the Lieutenant to us with an obvious fondness.
“John.” He said my Christian name with a disbelieving grin forming on his face, as though the very syllable was a prayer upon his lips. Holmes—Sherlock—looked at the air between us as though every particle around him was as incredible to him as a new clue to a case. As if the state of things before him was fleeting, lost any second now in the wanting of daydreams or old musings. I wanted nothing more than to prove him wrong—that this was not a feeling to be left in the dust of fantasy.
Holmes, Lord Hamilton—or rather, Thomas—and I returned to our seats, an indication of a true start to the evening. On a superior day, Thomas’ musings of Ruskin and Byron may have compelled my attention more so. However, after the events of the morning and afternoon, my soul was in a state quite unfit for such detached contemplation. As I could tell Holmes was carefully observing the young Lord, I elected to focus my attention on the Navy Lieutenant of few words, brooding yet attentive in Thomas’ shadow. I saw much of my past self in his stance; the hardened officer with a role to fulfill.
James ran his hands over his face for what must have been the hundredth time that night. Agony lined his every feature, just as much as exhaustion and rage did, and I thought back to the request Miranda made of me that afternoon. Could she find it in herself to forgive me for what I so failed to do?
“I can only hope they did, after all. However, Madi and Max appear to be skilled tacticians, and I know that you definitely are one. Given all three minds combined, along with Holmes’ intellect, Silver and Rackham’s wit, and Vane and Anne’s brawn, I doubt that we would fail unless something unprecedented and unstoppable comes against them.”
“What is it you wish to speak with me about, Thomas?” Sherlock asks after weighing his options. Silence could only last so long, after all.
Holmes leapt up from his chair to usher me out the door, a buzz about him that I had not seen in far too long before this case. In other circumstances, his joy would have reflected within me, his smile so often an instant source of calm in my soul. Yet, with every waking moment, I felt my friend reach closer to the truth behind these individuals; a truth I so feared to uncover myself.
James fetched a cloth from beside the basin, wetting it in the water there, and wiped his face clean of blood and soot. He offered me a clean dampened cloth to wash myself, and I accepted with a nod. Silver sat down at the furthest chair from the door, and James and I followed soon after while Holmes elected to lean against the wall and light a cigarette from his shining silver case.
“We have twenty shots between us. There are only two men coming for now, judging by the steps. The vanguard. But there may be more behind them; how far, I do not know.” James gave me a grave and serious look, the look of a commander looking to bring an army into battle. “I suggest you do not waste your bullets, Doctor Watson.”
Steadfastly ignoring James, Silver met my eyes. “Doctor, you need to get him out of there. You need to get him on a horse, get him to Marilès, and make sure he doesn’t fucking die on the way.”
It was then that I realised just how frequent that same look had passed over him in my presence. Whether it was almost twenty years ago, as he regaled me with his most astute observations of the Jefferson Hope case; that sparkle of pride and excitement. Or, if it was in the moments before he turned his revolver upon the man who had dared put me in harm's way upon the train just days prior. Perhaps, it was found more often in moments I did not see. In the times I looked upon the result of a case he so astutely solved, and he admired my thrill from afar. How many times had this look upon his face gone unseen? How many times had it been seen, but dismissed as nothing but a fanciful expression from an eccentric man I adored above all others? How long had these glances meant what I dared to interpret them to mean now, before two men who loved so free of the shackles of shame?
“That is not the reason why I enquired.” James exhaled deeply to offset the pain of the thread going into his skin. “If— If Thomas is in a state such as this—you know him, doctor. You know how important his mind is to him. He would not wish for a life such as this, I am sure of it.” James looked up over his shoulder. “Perhaps this is unfair of me to ask, but I will do so anyway: had our places been swapped and you were faced with the same decision regarding Holmes, in this worst case scenario, how would you act?”
—recently heard from our powerful client, rang a garrish bell of recognition in my mind. This fascinating woman before me was none other than Lord Thomas Hamilton’s wife, the Lady Holmes and myself were to be investigating for her sordid affair. I dared not to indicate as such with my words, nor my expression, for it could jeopardise Holmes’ work before it had even begun. I could feel uncomfortable warmth creep on the back of my neck, thinking of the letter that the Earl of Ashbourne had shown us—it felt distinctly improper to be so familiar with a stranger’s private passion in such a way.
A concern lined the face of my caring wife, and her grip upon my arm tightened. She stole me away onto a secluded bench within the park, and turned to face me.
“Gentlemen,” Eleanor Guthrie said, her sharp, discerning eyes fixed on us. “If you would please surrender your weapons, this would be much easier on all of us.”
A hush came over the table then, as all four of us seemed to lean in toward one another. In an effort to reduce the radius of the conversation, Mary came around to my side of the booth to listen closer. True, the tavern was run by people who were familiar to James, but the sensitivity of our task was palpable nonetheless.
Instead, I smiled up at him as he watched me button up my shirt, and slipped on my winter slippers that he had placed before me. There was an unbearable weight within my chest as I realised, rather abruptly, that this was not the first time Sherlock had selected clothing for me after arousing me from sleep in the early morning. In our younger years, it was a rather common occurrence, in fact. Now, there was a quite separate gravity to the action. He was helping me dress myself in typical clothing, not a disguise. He was waking me from our shared bed, rather than my own bedroom. And, perhaps the most significant shift, he was not waking me up for the purpose of a lead in a most fascinating case. Now, all he wished for was to watch the sunrise in our new home.
Somehow, every word from Holmes worsened the fear bubbling within me. If my wife shared this concern, it was unreadable on her face. The terror swirled around my heart like a viper, ready to strike at any moment. If what Holmes said was true, the journey to the Hamilton estate was, undoubtedly, a doomed one.
She did not seem comforted or reassured by my words, as her hands kept twitching nervously on the table.
“Not at all, Thomas.” I swallowed, my throat feeling dry and closed up. I tried to wash away the feeling with another sip of port. I could hear the faint sounds of Miranda’s clavichord from down the hall to where I presumed her study to be. “Not at all. I was simply wondering—when you said you had had similar experiences of meeting truly great men, did you mean anyone in particular? Lieutenant McGraw?”
Thomas is the one who looks away now, seeming lost and out of place. He takes some time before answering. “I cannot— in these last two days, James has done little but sleep, which I cannot blame him for. He looks as if he has barely done so in the last five years. However, I cannot, will not simply assume that his feelings have stayed the same. I—” His hands bunch into fists as he fights something deep within himself. “The image of him was what kept me alive and sane through everything that has happened. I will never stop carrying him in my heart, as I have carried him all these years. However I am also painfully aware that it was my actions that lost him his career, something he has worked his whole life towards. I would be a fool to simply… hope that his heart still belongs to me.”
“Ah, my dear biographer here embellishes of his own accord. However, if you are ever in need of my professional capacities, do not hesitate to knock upon Baker Street’s door.”
“Holmes, hello! Mary has garnered us an invitation to the Hamilton salon this evening,” I informed, enthusiasm flowing through my voice. I expected my words to arouse him from his study, but there was no stirring visible in my friend’s form. “Was your afternoon successful?”
“I have not known James in any intimate manner since our first introduction, Thomas, as you know. Our brief interactions have often been laden with tension, distrust, or outright hostility. However, I have spent these last few months planning your rescue beside him, and I have seen now first hand the responses he has toward both your loss and your return. I have been left uncertain of many things since your father first came to me with his case, but not once have I questioned the truth behind James’ devotion to you. It did not waver when you were taken, and it has not wavered since. A change in career, or a change of a life could not wish to alter it. I doubt the end of civilisation itself would alter it.”
“What a ridiculous notion,” Mary laughed and gently patted my cheek. Even as our hearts belonged to others, my love for her was a constant I could not deny. In the weeks before our reunion, I would miss the warmth in her eyes as she looked at me. I would doubly miss how such simple, teasing phrases from her managed to ground me upon the earth like little else.
I blinked; I was quite sure that Silver had noticed us on our doorsteps. Perhaps he thought that we were distracted enough with our own exchange, or perhaps his desperation had crowned to the point that he was heedless of whether anyone saw him. Even from the considerable distance we had between us, I could see in clear view the ease that settled over James’ shoulders as his hands pulled Silver closer by the lapels as if he intended to devour him. I thought of our conversation, of our fear just earlier in this endless evening, and felt my chest warm with happiness for him. Silver, it seemed, was going to be staying, at least for a while.
Holmes collapsed onto the sofa, his head in his hands. “It appears this is one failure of my work that you cannot report,” he said with a huffed, pained laugh. “Watson… I cannot state the depths to which I am sorry.” The mask so often adorned on his face—one of cold calculation, or enthusiasm from an investigation—had vanished. Below, I found the pure emotion held within the man I’ve known for so long. A quiver in the lip, a stammer in his speech, and all that managed to emerge through it was a burdened man I had made a mission out of protecting. “I thought it better to throw myself into the fire and loneliness than to consider taking you with me.”
“I… cooked it?” Silver replied with a grin, immediately shedding the Scots and now speaking with a fairly indistinguishable English accent. If there was a reason for the deception, I could not discover it before they continued talking—however it troubled me that this man seemed to be capable of lying so easily about something so basic.
James huffed, though it was not convincing. The arrival of my friend had shaken him, and he now watched him with a keen eye; all the violence gone from his tense frame. “Last time I was in contact, I thought I had made it quite clear to you that I do not want you to involve yourself in this more than necessary.”
I relayed what little information of the Hamilton affair I knew to Mary, in the hush of the tree cover and ambience of Hyde Park. In honesty, reliving the events by way of description alone gave me a new perspective to the start of my day. How odd the interaction between the Earl and Holmes was, the nature of the letter Holmes found so fascinating. The expression on Mary’s face changed as my story came to a conclusion.
“I implore you not to misread my tone for hostility, madam. Your assistance in the matter and your existing knowledge of the Hamiltons is quite welcomed, I assure you.”
A quick, pointed smile wisped across Holmes’ lips just then, as if he knew the precise moves in this game of chess to play next. Despite the imminent danger of it all, a warmth radiated through my chest to see him this way; in the line of fire, and yet unwavering in his will to push on.
“I do not want your apology, Holmes,” I spoke again after many agonising seconds. “All I want is an answer to one question.”
“For me to employ the aid of none other than yourself and Mrs. Watson, of course. It is clear to me now that the Hamiltons—while often more personable than others in their social circle—are most secretive indeed beneath the surface. To uncover what they wish to cloak in the shadow of open minded philosophy and progressive politics, that is what interests me. Yourself and Mary must befriend them. Report to me whatever information you can muster, and do not withhold a single detail, no matter how insignificant it may seem. I need you to do this for me, Watson.”
I could not tell if Holmes’ comment came from a place of harsh implication, or genuine support. Knowing what I did of him, I imagined it was the latter, yet I appeared to be living my existence on edge in a manner I had not done in years. Every minor word out of place sparked terror in my heart, shattering my hopes at composure. I no longer felt to be a level-headed member of this detective partnership, and feelings such as that were unwelcome in work sensitive as this.
Every eye moved from James and Silver to the form of my friend, including my own, and I felt my heart move to my throat.
“I-I’m sorry, I did not—” I attempted, but was interrupted as his lips crashed into mine with fervour. There was an intensity behind this new kiss that was less present in the first—as though Holmes was trying to pour two decades of feeling into one touch. When he released me, our eyes met for me to see the fire now burning within him.
Mary’s eyes glinted in amusement. “My dearest John. Yourself, James, Holmes and Mr. Silver are going to return to London—a place which holds many enemies to both James and Holmes—infiltrate a network of dangerous people who have attempted to kill you, and discover information to then use to track down a train and blow it up. Miranda and I are going to a small French countryside town, with well-established connections already, to locate and settle down into some cottages and perhaps do some interior decorating while we are at it. And you want
At first, I had intended for my record of the Hamilton affair to join the numerous accounts of my adventures alongside Sherlock Holmes in The Strand. Given Holmes’ initial intrigue and excitement with the case presented before us, I was certain that it would delight the many avid followers of my famous friend’s exploits. Oh, how dramatically have our circumstances changed since. Nevertheless, I find myself compelled to record this remarkable course of events for my own private memoir if nothing else, in the hope that one day—once the lives of those involved are not in mortal danger—this rather exceptional story will touch someone’s heart as it has so touched mine.
If James did say anything in reply to this odd discussion I did not hear it, but he did not take his hand off Silver’s forearm. We reached my rooms and slipped inside, as Holmes locked the door behind us with a decisive clang.
“I would like to discuss the details with you later today, doctor. Even now, this is not the most discreet of location, at least not enough for this.”
Holmes sighed. “As mentioned, his network of contacts was not to be underestimated. He had been doing the Earl’s dirty work for some time, in exchange for political favours. In Lord Ashbourne’s eyes, Mr. Flint and Lady Hamilton were nothing but loose threads that needed cutting.”
“I can inquire to some retired officers, although I cannot promise any certainty with such a venture.”
“I believe, my dear doctor, that it is best to show you rather than to tell you. Are you otherwise engaged this evening?” A chipper tone lined his words in such a way that I could feel his excitement. I could not claim to understand it, but it caused equal parts joy and concern within me. What about this case of affairs within aristocracy could bring about such elation from my friend?
“You stupid, ridiculous, impossible man,” she nearly cried, holding him in a tight embrace. “You could have gotten yourself
I took a calculated breath as I finished the first set of stitches before answering the weighted question. I motioned for him to lean forward so as to begin on the other side of his wounded shoulder.
“Yes,” Sherlock interrupts. He does not wish to see Thomas struggle any further through the terror those memories must encapsulate. “You were in a place quite unlike mine, Thomas. To believe him in that moment was of no choice of yours. In my case, it was not for lack of information, nor helplessness. It was cowardice, and if I have learned anything in the last half decade, it is that to be a coward in the face of such things is inexcusable.”
His reassurance was brief, but a warm flush washed over me all the same. All these years, I had assumed the worst. That I had made myself too unsavoury of company myself, and that Holmes could not stand to tolerate it any longer. Despite the stress of the evening, a relaxing feeling came upon me that I had not felt in what I may have labelled an eternity. It did not answer all my questions, but it was enough.
“Perhaps,” I finally interjected in this heated discussion with some trepidation. “We could leave the logistical discussions of the route and the rescue until the morning.”
“James,” I said in a hush, looking at the broken, haunted man near me. He shook his head, incapable of any speech.
“There is something beneath the surface of this case, Watson. Something I cannot place. It is unclear quite how sinister the layers may be.”
“Rather lively discussion was had, indeed, Lord Hamilton,” Holmes responded, a warm look about him. His eyes held an ease they had lacked upon our arrival, and yet I swear I was able to see the cogs within his mind turn at every word from Thomas’ mouth. “I appreciated such freedom of dialogue; rather unlike the aristocratic events I have visited in the past.”
“I believe my informants have pinpointed a location,” James relayed in a voice similarly hushed. “He is likely not there during the day, so once we have the location, we would not be able to make an approach sundown. At this stage, there is little else to do.”
“Miss Guthrie, I assume you have discovered the nature of my presence here, then?” Holmes asked as an impassioned, sly look overtook his features as we were all surrendering our weapons. It had been far too long since I had seen such a look upon my friend’s face, and I relished in it for a brief moment before the tense exchange continued. Once the last revolver was handed over, the pressure in my back disappeared and I was able to once again look at my companions. We were all three of us held at gunpoint still, by four men who had materialised behind us. Vane and Rackham looked between our group and Eleanor Guthrie as if they were the spectators of a tennis match.
“By your shift in posture at my words, I take it that a promise of Mr. Rogers’ debts paid may change your next action. Am I correct?”
Seated at the bar was the same feisty-looking blonde woman who had met us yesterday and who—I assumed by the way she was issuing commands with curt nods of her head and the big set of keys hanging on her belt—was the owner of the establishment. I wondered, vaguely, how she knew James at all and thought that if Holmes were here he would immediately form some conclusion about her beyond what I could see with the naked eye. She turned her head and I immediately looked away, dreading to be caught staring. Before any more thoughts of my friend could fog over my mind in early morning daydreams, Mary’s voice arrived, as welcome as always, echoing through the nearly empty dining room.
Even though I could not see his face, I could tell Jack was smug. “We will have to take the long way around, lest we be caught by Glasgow bobbies in the dead of night on horseback.” The lilt I had first noticed in his voice sounded again—I imagined it was natural to his way of speaking. “Apologies for the lack of detailed introductions, Doctor Watson, but I think we may need to find a roof over our heads and a stiff drink before we exchange niceties and personal histories, don’t you?”
But his words died in his throat as James recoiled in on himself at the touch and nearly fell to his knees. Silver’s arm immediately went around his waist to keep him upright and I cursed myself then, for only then did I see the way James held his shoulder, the way he stood and realised that blood would not be visible on his dark clothes.
I met Holmes’ eyes and nodded, in reassurance that I will be okay. Rackham let me lean on him as he led me to what I assumed was the cargo hold.
Once inside the hansom, Mary inquired further of the nature of this case. The three of us traversing to a high society affair led me to reminisce of when Holmes and I made Mary’s acquaintance at first; a client in need of assistance in discovering the mystery of her inheritance. Many years had passed since then, and yet it never ceased to bring me joy at the thought. Now, the nostalgia of a past case may be little more than a justification for my mind to escape the fear of what was to come next.
“Ah, no, not— not quite, doctor. Mr. Flint is distressed, certainly, but it is the passengers of this train that I need your help with.”
And with that, this marks the end of our intermission! Starting Thursday, we will be posting with our regular schedule and sharing Act Two of the fic. I hope you enjoy!
“I will get to this too, bear with. I solved the case regarding young Abigail Ashe—she was abducted by a scorned opponent of the Lord’s by the name of Low— and she was returned to safety. Afterwards, I dedicated the following months to studying Lord Ashe. With my many underground contacts around London, I obtained a correspondence between him and Lord Ashbourne from May of 1894, just before Lord Ashbourne came to employ my aid on proving his daughter-in-law’s infidelity.”
In an instant, the heat drained from the young woman’s face. It was as if I could see her blood run cold, and the discriminating spotlight now lay on her, rather than any other soul in the room. James inhaled sharply in surprise, while Vane looked from Holmes to Eleanor, his eyes wild. Once again, he strained against the ropes holding him, seemingly thinking he could rip the post straight out the floor.
“Have you considered that the confidant you have found in the owner of this establishment may have ulterior motives?”
“Good,” I turned to look at Silver’s face, surprised that this had come from him. There was anger there, anger that I had not expected to see replace his mild, cheery disposition. I realised again that John Silver was a man of depth and complexity that I had not yet begun to understand. “Yet one thing eludes me, Mr. Holmes. How was Lord Ashe aware of the Captain— of Flint’s movements?”
Thomas leans back in his chair. His hands no longer hold his teacup -- he is now absentmindedly running a thumb over the raised scar on his wrist. Sherlock tries very hard not to think about it. “When I was taken to Reading Gaol, I asked for nothing. I made no demands, I did not try to use my status or my name to gain special treatment. I did none of this; all I asked was for news of James and Miranda and their safety. I asked to write to them and was denied the opportunity to do so; was punished for requesting it. Then, my father came; six months after my imprisonment, he arrived to see if I had ‘learned my lesson’, as it is. Naturally, you can imagine the first question I asked him as soon as I saw him.”
“How is it that you are so certain to abandon your work in London for this? You knew the Hamiltons less than even I did, and you have spent so much of your adult life building your reputation as that of a consulting detective. What is it that motivates you to leave behind all of that for these people who have so often shown disdain and mistrust towards you? Especially considering the fact that we do not know for certain whether we will find Thomas Hamilton alive.”
. As an army doctor, I thought I had seen the full extent of human misery, that nothing about how a man’s body could be mistreated could shock me anymore. Oh, how wrong I was.
I paused my ministrations for a moment at the repeat of the memory in my mind. It would take many years for the image of what we found in that train car to be erased.
My mouth worked uselessly, and I came to realise that I had no idea what I wanted to say to him. For what does one say at all, what words would be strong enough for this moment? Thankfully, Thomas did not seem to demand any words of me either—instead, he beamed, pulling me into an embrace. One-armed, as James was still holding onto his hand, never wanting to let go.
Though, it was less a request, more so an affirmation of what must be done. I knew her aid was the best method here.
Our unusual company entered the tavern in quite the state—James and myself still covered in blood and debris, Vane and Jack’s clothes were scorched, and James was bleeding from the wound in his head. There were a small handful of patrons lining the bar stools and booths of the pub, engaged in hushed conversations. Smoke was curling up towards the low ceiling. From the second we walked in, I spotted the unmistakable shape of John Silver, leaning against one of the support beams in the middle of the room, his curved smile directed at a young man around his age. Rather than the crutch he used that morning, he had a wood and metal prosthetic affixed to his leg. Before I could register the stares being sent our way from the concerned customers, James stormed up to Silver and pushed him against the pole, leaving his companion startled and wide-eyed at the scene in front of him.
For all my years on this earth, I had never seen an expression of love such as theirs; two human beings, whom fate had dealt the unluckiest of cards, had defeated the odds and come out on the other side covered with terrible wounds, yet capable of existing in tenderness. As improper as it may have been, I could stop looking at them.
Miranda Barlow was rather different in demeanour and appearance to that of Lady Miranda Hamilton of five years ago. Of course, she was the same in all ways that are necessary, but no longer was she adorned in extravagant silks that so often made up the frocks of nobility, nor was the title of cozy aristocracy granting her freedom from the woes of the world. With all that removed, it seemed to make her stature look somewhat smaller. Miranda, I thought, was a woman who was born to dress fashionably. Her clothes now were plain and somewhat worn— I remembered her letters and James’ words, realising that life could not have been easy for them in America. A guilty twinge pierced my heart that I had offered them no financial help in that time, though I doubt they would have accepted it.
“He has evaded the front door, it seems. Curious… Ah! He has positioned himself under a window. Lady Hamilton’s, I can only assume. He appears to be… whistling. Ah, of course! Hear that, Watson?” And almost outside my earshot I did indeed hear a faint whistle, which could have sounded like a bird, or the screech of a street carriage. A faint light appeared in the window that McGraw was standing under, and it blinked twice, as if someone was running a hand over a candle. “There he goes now, all the way back to the servant’s entrance. A gentle knock upon it … he is waiting, still and… there. McGraw was let in with ease and he did not even cast a glance back towards the street. Truly fascinating, Watson.” Holmes lowered the tool from his eyes in a slow movement, yet maintained his gaze upon the Hamiltons’ home for a moment longer.
“Lady Miranda Hamilton," she said in a pleasant, clear voice. "It is a pleasure to meet you Dr. Watson.”
“You said that all the Lords had rejected Thomas’ plan, Captain. That at the time you all felt that Lord Ashe was the only choice you had to go forward.”
We reached the post office, I sent off my letter to Sherlock Holmes, and we made our way back to the warm hearth of The Hangman’s Rest, quiet but for the shuffling of our clothes and the mud beneath our shoes.
“It is no bother at all, dear fellow,” Thomas said, waving a hand with a smile. “It is truly a pleasure to have you here and both Miranda and I enjoy your company inordinately.” He kept his eyes on me, studious and careful. “I am not surprised to hear that Mr. Holmes has been keeping you rather busy—I have been left with the impression that his work ethic is impeccable, yet punishing. Much like my own, I must say. It is not unheard of that I would forget to eat all day long until James reminds me to do so.”
“I would be rather grateful if you did not tear my skin with the suture.” There was no animosity in James’ voice; quite the contrary. “I shall be plain with you, doctor. One does not need to be a detective to see, quite clearly, that Holmes’ feelings for you are just as deep as the ones you have harboured for him all these years.”
“I mention this, Watson, because I know of your attachment to this land. You have never lived elsewhere, and your practise in London is rather dear to you. I worry— I have concern that this part of the journey may be one that could be too dangerous, or perhaps too painful, for you to embark on. If that is true, I will hold no fault toward you. It is a large change to commit yourself to for a man you knew so briefly and I—“
money?” Vane looks at the man who has a gun trained on him and the intensity of that gaze makes the man take a step back. “Why don’t you get on with it, motherfucker?”
Unbothered by my silence, James continued. He had slipped into the story as effortlessly as I had seen him do before; this man, I thought—with some degree of envy—was born to be a storyteller.
“Why Holmes, that now reminds me—on the evening of the salon at the Hamilton estate, I did not see McGraw leave. At the time I did not think much of it at all, assuming he must have made a quiet exit without bidding any of us goodbye but now your observations do leave me wondering whether he simply spent the night there. If you forgive my crudeness, I would assume that he did so in Lady Hamilton’s bedchamber.” As I spoke, the conclusion I related to Holmes was not one I had full faith in. I had been witness to the conversation between Mary and Lady Hamilton the previous day, and the implications of such were incongruent with my words to Holmes. Yet, stating such doubt was not possible.
“Sherlock,” I muttered through my bleary haze. Out of my line of sight, a set of cautious lips pressed against my shoulder.
“There is no escape from here, Doctor. The height would be too far for us to jump from. We have no time to be fashioning a rope out of bed sheets. The only way out is the way we came in.”
Shaking like a leaf, Miranda let go of Thomas and cupped his face, still sobbing, in disbelief of what she was seeing. Then, she stepped to the side and I saw the moment when Thomas and James locked eyes across the small distance separating them.
“James, the entire house will be upon us in mere minutes!” I could scarcely breathe with the anxiety tearing through my gut. “The gunshots—”
“What absent phrases sparked your interest?” I hoped he could not read the battle behind my eyes, or the resistance in my heart.
“I have a cache,” James began, as though catching on to Holmes’ plan without a word. “Off the coast of Florida, near the Bahama Islands. It is mostly gold, however there are some gems and pearls in it too. I bought them with the money I stole while disrupting the cotton trade to Alfred Hamilton’s industrial endeavours. I left it there before I left Florida as a means of security. As you know, I did not have much in financial means upon my relocation to Savannah and I did not wish to find myself in the same situation ever again. I suppose there is no better time than now to utilise it. I will give you the precise coordinates of the cache, so long as you free those men, and give me some information.”
“Holmes, forgive the interruption, but what in the Lord’s name are you talking about?” At that, he jolted upright, looking at me square on with a puzzled expression.
“Are you being intentionally obtuse with me, or has all your previous comprehension of propriety left you in the night?” I did not wish to start a quarrel with him, and my tone was calm, but my nerves throughout their interaction could not be mended.
James took a deep breath. “All I wish for him to do is what would make him happy,” he said carefully. “Seeing him in Glasgow with Madi—it is clear he cares for her deeply, and she cares for him in equal measure. It would be difficult for him… to be away from her.”
“You say one of your Irregulars gave you confirmation of Lady Hamiltons’ presence at the exhibition, yet that is hardly enough information for you to know of my new friendship with her. How did you manage to gain such intel, in truth, Mr. Holmes?” I must admit, I was equally curious about this matter. Holmes appeared to be behaving in a manner I had not seen in years; cryptic wording, high spirited movements. It was not an unwelcome change to his previous blue moods from inactivity, yet I couldn’t help but feel displaced by it.
As he came out of the cargo hold, Vane threw the gun to the side as if it burned his skin to hold it. In an instant, Rackham was at his side, two hands on his shoulders. His words were too quiet for me to hear, yet I could see Vane leaning into the touch. A vulnerability I did not think him capable of was clear in every distressed line of his face.
Before Silver could actually shoot any of them at all, a terrifying gurgling sound came from the men’s direction. I looked up and saw that both men who had been standing next to Vane and Rackham now had two deep gashes in their necks that were spurting blood wildly. I gasped at the sight, for the men in question were still tied to the posts and had not moved from their position. Rackham’s voice then reached me, overflowing with what I could only describe as sheer adoration.
I nodded towards James, who was close to nodding off where he sat. “It would be a betrayal of my Hippocratic Oath if I did not send this man to get some rest right away. We all have been through quite the ordeal tonight and, speaking for myself and a few of us here, I would be much better equipped to plan a daring rescue mission on a head full of sleep and a belly full of food.”
“If you could lower the daggers in your gaze for a moment, perhaps you could allow me to explain. I think I know why you chose to change your allegiances, but I need your confirmation to prove me correct.”
“What request is that?” The pain in her eyes indicated the depth of meaning in her words. I knew James valued her, loved her as much as a man of his persuasion could love a wife, but I could also see the hurt his secrets caused her.
“I called him a self-obsessed careerist,” Thomas said with a gentle smile, “and he rather heavily implied that I was but a spoiled noble, with no idea of the world beyond the walls of his parlour. I have to say, this was the moment that I was certain we would become fast friends.”
“Debt? Is that all this is?” Silver spoke again, forcing my gaze back to him and James. James’ hand was on his belt, flicking at the buckle in a mindless action, as if he was reaching for a sword that was no longer to be found there.
“The Captain will be taking care of your breakfast, so you are in good hands,” Silver explained at our puzzled looks. “He is, I loathe to admit, a
Warmth drained from my face at Holmes’ words, as if they were directed at my own private life. Such secrets, hidden beneath the foundations of the Hamilton estate, were nebulous in their truth, and conflicting in my heart. The curiosity of the detective contradicting the sensitivity of a shameful man, hidden behind a veil of my own making.
Then, the knock upon our door, a rattle of the door handle, a muffled voice: “Hello! Are you in there?”
“I do not rightly know. But whatever it is that we do need to talk about, it is best that we do it now. The peace we are looking to build here is a fragile one and any tension between us will endanger it.” There is no threat in Thomas’ voice. Only gentle concern. “And I think too highly of you and John to allow this.”
“Flint!” she exclaimed and threw him one of her weapons. James caught it with ease and, without a second’s hesitation, stabbed his opponent right in the belly.
He raised his hand to stop me from talking. “I am the one who should apologise, Doctor Watson. I did not mean for—” He seemed lost for words for a moment, which, I assumed, was a rarity for him indeed. “It was not my intention to make you believe I have any demands towards you. Quite the contrary. As I said, you are a rather remarkable man, in many ways—and I will stand by this assessment any day. Nevertheless, I am not blind, doctor. I know very well that your heart belongs to another.” A gentle, careful smile appeared on his face, one intended to comfort rather than mock. His gaze and voice both turned unbearably soft, as he added, quietly, almost pious in his revelation: “In fact, so does mine.”
He offered the letter to Holmes for further inspection, and I resisted the temptation to examine it myself. Enough impropriety had occurred in the previous moments, so I elected to return to my notes in the interim. A moment passed, and Holmes folded the letter back into its envelope, placing it in his own breast pocket.
“We are well aware of the purpose of your journey here, Captain Flint,” Madi added, gently. “And we wish to help you, as you have helped us over the years. Please accept this.”
Thomas’ face appeared to brighten from the approval bestowed upon him. “I pride myself on providing a comfortable space to explore freedom of thought and expression within these walls, despite the disapproval it may garner from certain parties that are best to remain nameless. And, as I already made clear, Mr. Holmes, I do insist you call me Thomas. There is no need for such formalities between friends, which I hope we are now. Dr. Watson, was your evening well spent?”
His mention of this sent me back to the events of the previous morning, which felt infinitely further back in my memory than was sensical. The old man who sat alone, nursing a drink from the night before, looking disheveled and unkempt, was none other than my dear friend. It reminded me of a similar encounter I had with the man more than half a decade prior, when I thought him dead. He had dressed himself as an elderly bookstore owner, only to reveal his true identity to me within the privacy of my practise. The similarity did not go unnoticed in me, nor did the fact that much of our reunion on this night felt as though our friendship was coming back to life yet again. This time, with much more immediate danger.
“To what, my dear Watson, do you refer? I was being nothing if not cordial with our guest,” he deflected, but a knowing grin spread across his cheek. I ignored the familiar, glimmering eyes sent my way in favour of engaging my curiosity.
Holmes’ reply rattled me where I stood. My friend was direct in his communication, and firm in his morals, but never before this time had I seen him so objectionable with a potential client.
I do not know what to make of this odd request, old friend, yet I had not the heart to refuse it to the poor sod, what in his state and all. I hope it is of some use to you and Holmes. Do write to me if there is any help you need or if you feel you can provide me with some clarification—which, of course, you do not need to feel obliged to give.
“Tonight, you say? And what time might be best that we arrive?” I turned to meet Lady Hamilton’s gaze as I accepted her invitation, and she beamed in return.
made something go weak in my knees. For I had heard of places like these, and I had heard of the monstrous treatments that they subjected their patients to—electrical and malariotherapy in the milder cases and invasive, illegal brain surgeries in the most severe.
Holmes looked at me and an unexpected smile appeared on his face, a smile that lit a fire in my blood the way only he could. “Now,” Sherlock Holmes said, “We are going to free Thomas Hamilton.”
“Silver, what in the hell do you think you’re doing?” James spoke as though he knew the man well, and yet was exasperated with his very presence.
“Moreover, Lady Hamilton’s respectful tone and kind words painted a very different picture from the one presented by the Earl. I am sure you would agree, Watson, considering your experience of the luncheon yourself and Mary shared with her. The Lady’s words all appeared to be sourced from genuine emotion toward each individual she spoke with but none more so than her husband. I observed the several brief interactions between them, Watson. No phrase or affirmation from Lady Hamilton was out of place, no look or single word seemed to be filled with some nefarious purpose. Indeed, all I observed was a woman who held a great love and admiration for the young Lord. I have spent nearly two decades in the work of detection, my dear doctor, and consider myself rather skilled in the art of unveiling nefarious intent behind a welcoming face. For the life of me, I could not locate a manipulative soul beneath the eyes of Lady Hamilton. This can lead to some fascinating convictions indeed. Tell me, Watson, what did your interaction with Lieutenant McGraw reveal for you?”
They stared at each other for a moment, James’ hands wrung in Silver’s coat so he could stay upright, their faces so close there was hardly a breath of air between them. The intensity in their shared gaze was so powerful it took my breath out of my lungs. With their faces bathed in firelight, with the blood on their hands that was not their own, with the soot on their faces, I could see it clearly—John Silver and James Flint, two men who were ready to bring the world to heel, two men to whom nothing was impossible if they were of the same mind.
I awoke the following morning at the sound of the eight o’clock bell from a nearby clock tower. James was still nowhere to be seen and he had not spent the night in the room. After dressing and washing, I ventured down to the tavern below in search of breakfast. No familiar faces were present at the tables or bar stools yet, so I located a booth suited for four, and ordered myself an Earl Grey in the interim. The early morning patrons of The Hangman’s Rest were scattered and few in number at this time of morning, presumably a majority of whom were guests at the Inn or locals who lived nearby and were desperate for company. There was one elderly man hunched over a pint glass, half asleep and swaying with his face hidden beneath the brim of his hat. Remembering James’ anxiety, I regarded him carefully but found no cause for concern; he seemed to still be nursing a drink from the night prior.
“Good morning yourself, Doctor. Have you perhaps come across James this morning?” The question fell from her lips as though she had asked it hundreds of times in her life and had always received the same, disappointing answer. She did not meet my eyes.
I gave Mary a gentle smile and pulled her into my arms into a comforting embrace. “I am so happy for you, my dear. I am so happy that you have found each other. You deserve no less.”
Thomas furrows his brow, looking thoughtful. As if he has forgotten that he was the one that came to their doorstep in the first place.
“I will contact you within the fortnight with my findings,” Holmes affirmed in confidence. I stood to regard our guest again, leading him toward the door.
We put James on it with some effort. He was still conscious, yet it was clear that he was struggling with it. The blood loss had made him drowsy and sluggish, and I feared our ability to get to Marilès safely.
Holmes continued. “After this revelation, I wondered how much of Lord Hamilton’s imprisonment and subsequent report of his death were tied to Lord Ashe. How involved had he truly been in all of this? I have spent much of the last six months studying the underbelly of Peter Ashe’s work, Mr. Flint, and it appears that it stretches up to Glasgow as well.”
“The official article chronicling Thomas Hamilton’s trial did not state the name of the witness who emerged prior to the incriminating outburst now made infamous. But if the
Thomas’ eyebrows rose up in bewilderment, eyes widening ever so slightly. My heart clenched, afraid that I had offended him with just the assumption that I could not force myself to speak. He was a perceptive man, however—I watched the realisation dawn on his face, as his mouth formed a quiet “Oh” and he took a gentle step back.
“I am rather afraid I do, Mr. Flint. It appeared that Lord Ashe had come into possession of the old clock belonging to Lord Hamilton and his wife. Now, if your report of his trustworthiness from years ago was correct, why would he have acquired the condemned belongings of an old, imprisoned friend? Would he have bought it at an auction? Surely, that is not something you would expect a trusted friend to do, would it?
And, with that, Holmes departed from our rooms, presumably to receive more information about Lord and Lady Hamilton. My friend was not incorrect in his assertion. I had somewhere to be for a luncheon, and no intention of being late.
This did not feel like my outings with Holmes, uncovering clues to a larger case or story. This felt like a vigilante mission with one aspect left entirely certain as the rest were left up to chance:
You reject my efforts in closeness, or whatever intimacy you so often referred to us holding in the years before you left. I wish, often, to return to those years. The years before marriage, age, and scandal of the most dangerous sort. Do you wish the same? Do you wish for anything, save the next case in your records, the next client at your step? That is a foolish question, is it not? I know the answer, or at least I used to. I used to think I understood the complexity of your mind, and your emotions, beyond that of the aloof detective in my serials. Now, as I count the months since last we spoke as I read your name within the Times, I wonder if any of those past observations were true.
James’ breathing quickened, though he clearly made an effort to stay collected as much as he could. “Vane said it is a life akin to slavery. He killed them because he knew this; he has seen it before, I know as much. Would you— is this an assessment you would agree with, Doctor Watson?”
Holmes and I weaved through the remaining crowd and out the door of the Red Lion, moving at a pace quick enough to match the Lieutenant, but not to spring his attention upon us. We stayed several steps behind him, ensuring that we ducked around corners and used cover behind anything we could find. McGraw was a shrewd man and he was not to be underestimated; he looked over his shoulder several times with a discerning, careful gaze, however we seemed to succeed in remaining hidden from his sight.
“Of course. I shall begin, then.” Holmes took an inhale from his cigarette before exhaling the smoke across the room, ceremoniously beginning his mysterious story. I could not help the captivation that came over me at the energy he held.
Holmes acknowledged his reaction and turned to myself and Silver. “You see, gentlemen, I am not a forgetful man. My work resides solely in the details, and the gold plated hands of this clock and the sound of its bell rang ever so familiar in my mind. I knew, without a shadow of a doubt, that I had seen this clock before, and that it had been somewhere of importance. After a moment of rumination, I remembered. I had seen it five years prior, in the parlour of a house in Palace Street, where I attended a rather memorable salon hosted by Lord Thomas Hamilton.”
“You met James and Miranda in America?” So many questions about this vibrant man ran through my mind, but the least invasive of them came to my mind first.
“Only a problem for their stomachs—and their ears, I’m afraid. I think I told you to drop the fucking accent.” James walked over to our booth and sat himself opposite us. Up close, I confirmed that he did not seem much worse for wear, though I could see the fatigue and exhaustion in his face. He did not take his discerning eyes off Silver as he sequestered Miranda’s fork in hand and bit off a piece of sausage. He then did what all of us seemed to be too polite to do and spat it out across the floor. “Good Lord. What the
“You tell tales of your own, don’t you Dr. Watson?” he asked me, reaching over to a table nearby and grabbing a mug of ale that had somehow materialised there. I would have questioned such consumption at the early hour, but it felt rather unnecessary given his otherwise eccentric behaviour.
“Yet, it appears he spends a majority of his time within the Hamilton estate, or the professional office at Whitehall. I concluded that, during midday on a Saturday, he would either be in his own lodgings, or with the Hamiltons. Locating the Lord and Lady is much simpler than finding a quiet Navy Lieutenant, so I enquired within my usual channels around St. James’s and Central London to unearth the couple’s whereabouts.
I admit, I did maintain some acquaintances with military histories from my visits to the Criterion Bar, but few of those I spoke to were tied to the Navy, nevermind active officers.
I did not know what had pushed me to ask this; perhaps, it was an answer I was seeking within myself, too.
Holmes and I stared at her, however something brightened up on Silver’s face when he saw her. He struggled to his feet as quickly as he could, hindered by his peg leg.
“I presume McGraw was signalling Lady Hamilton’s window, and it was none other than the Lady herself who opened the door?” I inquired after a brief quiet moment. “I do wonder how he was so confident signalling her while knowing he may wake her husband instead?”
By a quarter of an hour—and a great number of moments concealing ourselves behind objects in the street—Holmes and I reached the Hamilton estate, several feet behind McGraw. Holmes extracted his compact binoculars from within his inner breast pocket, and observed what he could through the cloak of night.
After some murmured apologies for our foiled breakfast, Silver seemed to make himself comfortable seated in the booth with us. James looked at him for a bit then huffed, got up and vanished towards the kitchen without a word. The owner gave him a questioning look and he nodded, saying something to her out of earshot—her eyes then turned to Silver, sharp as a dagger. Silver returned a bright smile and an apologetic shrug.
“It would fit the mold I have uncovered here, yes. Whilst her father has been known to speak of his daughter with some contempt in the past, they appear to have found a recent middle ground of convenience. A middle ground that just so happened to involve her taking over this tavern, according to his most recent letter to Lord Ashe.”
“Holmes, what was it that you discovered this afternoon?” I enquired, uncertain of the information my friend held in his grasp, and impatient for the unveiling of it.
“On the contrary, Mr. Flint. In the months before your arrival in Glasgow, with the help of my informants, I have made my own moves in this horrific game. If you have forgotten, Lord Ashe and Lord Ashbourne wronged me as well, though perhaps not to the degree they condemned you or Thomas Hamilton. They threatened something of immense importance to me, something that I could not forgive being used against me in this way. Upon this realisation, I could do little to quell the rage it bore inside of me. I—” Holmes took pause and shot me a quick glance. “Peter Ashe has been taken care of. He is not a concern you need worry yourself with any longer.”
as though quoting the words of someone outside himself. “The worst parts of London—of England—are not those who exist in the difficult edges and margins that high society wishes to eradicate. The worst parts of this country are found in the meeting rooms at Whitehall. They are found in the parlours of the landed gentry, in the summer estates of Shropshire and Darbyshire. They are the true gutter of our society, Watson, only no one acknowledges it because they tend to dress nicely. I have no interest continuing to work in such a place.” He gave me a small, unexpected smile. “In a rare occasion for a man of his class, Thomas Hamilton saw this. It is why he did the work that he did. I am a fool for not having seen it earlier; and if I do have even the faintest chance to rescue him and to ask his forgiveness for whatever part I may have played in his misfortune, I owe it to him and to all other wretches I have wronged during my career to try.”
James and Silver were, for a lack of a better word, arguing, but it was not truly an argument. Yes, James seemed tired and exasperated as he always did, and yes, John Silver seemed to carry the already familiar expression on his face that implied that he was always right, however their bodies seemed to be gravitating towards each other rather than shying away. Silver raised a sarcastic eyebrow, James threw his hands in the air saying something else and then, to my infinite surprise, John Silver reached and pulled James close and crushed their mouths together in a kiss.
She gave me a wry smile. “To be honest with you, I thought I may have to. I knew there was no way Miranda could return to London. And I would not be parted from her ever again. So I already said my goodbyes, darling. To me, a home is not a place. I discovered this long ago. My home is where she is.”
she walked closer to us then, piercing eyes trained on Silver, then on James. She did not acknowledge me or Holmes, yet I feared one stray movement could be the end of us both.
“Holmes, I thought you were—” I began to ask, but my friend’s warm hand touched my shoulder to silence me as we entered my room. The table from earlier that evening was still in its place, as were the three chairs from our meeting.
I swallowed, my throat moving painfully, every word feeling overcome with effort. “Thomas, I am—” How could I say what was on my mind without risking everything? How was I to know I could trust this man? “I do not think I can give you what you seek,” is what I finally settled on, watching his reaction with care, my entire body tense with anxiety.
of the world burning around me, I had to fight back against the same awful memories that James’ gunshot had awoken just moments prior. Now, they were domineering, and pushing against my mind with as much force as the thick fog of smoke. It was as if I was thirty years-old again, rushing through the shambles of a barricade we hoped would protect us, and I was just able to escape before a searing pain shot through me. The heat alone was unbearable. It bled into every single fold of my skin and I was certain, as certain as I had ever been, that I was going to die.
My friend delivered his sentence with the tone of a big revelation, so I thought back to what he may have been referring to, and came up short. Silver looked similarly confused. However, James stiffened beside me, his eyes wide.
Vane emerged from the hold behind us breathing heavy but seemingly unharmed. His eyes were burning with an emotion I could not describe with ease. It was as if he was so immersed in a memory beyond our reckoning that he could not quite see us there.
He jumped into the hold carriage and, through the noises around us, I clearly heard four gunshots echo through its metal walls. James’ face got impossibly paler and Silver’s hold on him tightened. I squeezed my eyes shut and slowly counted to ten.
“Go to Marilès. Meet a man named Featherstone, who Max has already contacted on our behalf. Let him take us to a place outside of town, where we will find long abandoned cottages. Make cottages habitable as much as we can. Immediately send you a letter with directions. I remember, John, I assure you that your fretting is nothing more than an indulgence.”
“James—” I started, wondering if my efforts may place me in the firing line of his poisoned stare. “Are you certain that he was the one to have done it? Is it possible that someone else could have—”
I looked at the letter that was still in Holmes’ hands and a feeling of unease settled deep in my gut. Although I had not read it, the meaning of my friend’s words was as clear as day: the witness—this Peter Ashe—had known of the truth regarding James and Thomas’ relationship. The moment Thomas had seen him on the witness stand, he had understood that James was about to be exposed, tried, and likely imprisoned as his lover. The Thomas Hamilton I knew would have never allowed this to happen—even at the cost of his own life.
“You absolutely did not.” James spat at the ground again with good measure. His face was stern, yet there was no real tension behind his expression. It was strange to see how different James McGraw was to James Flint. The quiet, refined Navy Lieutenant persona faded away to nothing, and someone grizzled and rough appeared in his place. It was not an unwelcome shift, but knowing the cause of it brought an ache to my heart. “I swear to God, Silver, could you not make a marginally more convincing cover? Literally anything else would have done.”
. Someone should say so, and someone should be willing to defend it.” He then smiled, but there was no happiness in it, no joy. It was sharp and dangerous. “One man? A hundred men? A thousand men? They would do nothing to keep me away from him. I would lay waste to the entire world, if it meant I could spend one more minute with him. Do not doubt that, even for a second.”
I do not miss you in the same way I did when I thought you dead. Now, rather, I think of all the glorious adventures you continue on with in my absence. I think of the rare moments when you have invited me along, and how they are a mere blip into the scope of your fantastical life. To be privy to any of it is a gift, but it does allow my daydreams to run wild with possibility. Do you enjoy your time away from me? Are you thankful to not have the limping, curious presence of a burdened man at your feet?
While Perry’s prosecution of robbery and libel was a strong one, Viscount Henderson’s counsel appeared invested in proving his innocence. Named accusations included that of sodomy and gross indecency in violation of the Criminal Law Amendment Act of 1885
James’ mouth curled. “Do you remember, Doctor Watson, the day when your colleague split my lip in Baker Street?”
“I know,” James said and I turned to look at him, crouched beside the Earl’s writing desk. I did not realise I had said my thoughts aloud. “Just give me one moment.”
The forward manner with which Lord Thomas Hamilton spoke took me by surprise, yet I felt compelled to respond all the same. Did he intend to imply my selfish intentions behind publishing Holmes’ and my cases? Or was I reading a truth behind his words that did not exist? Perhaps the agony in my heart was jumping to unnecessary conclusions. Despite his kind demeanour and gentle disposition, I felt uncomfortable under the scrutiny of this man’s knowing eyes.
“Go,” Silver said, when I got onto the horse. “Mary and Miranda will await you there. You remember the instructions?”
“Nonsense. Scratches and bruises aside, I am under an oath. I am the best suited individual in our current group to perform the stitches required here, anyway. Now, turn toward me, please.”
“It is a simple enough negotiation, is it not? Mr. Flint needs those men, and the rest of us here, alive. You want us out of your way so that your husband’s debts can be paid by the estate of Lord Ashe. Not only will said estate not be able to relay to you the funds you seek—as some recent tragedies within the family have significantly decreased their fortune—but we have more available to us than you were ever offered. So, if you let those men go, and allow us to give you the information required to obtain the aid you seek, perhaps we may diminish the bloodshed on this night, as there has already been enough.”
I did not dare doubt him. His statement, spoken so freely in the moonlit silence, left an odd feeling in my chest. Looking away once more, James adjusted himself for a long and lonely watch.
“Bastard!” James shouted, kicking the outer wall of the room with his boot. He leaned his still blood-stained head against the wallpaper, and sighed, unmoving.
As I reached to begin the examination of the wound, Mr. Hamilton caught me by the wrist with a force greater than I would have assumed from his weak constitution. We were alone in the room—I had insisted so, for I had respect for the wretch’s privacy—which only increased my anxiety, as I was certain he was seeking to hurt me. However, when my eyes met Hamilton’s, he did not look to me to be a man of an unsound mind. Quite the contrary, Watson, to me he seemed to be a fellow very much with his wits about him.
It may have been the strength of the port, or the overwhelming lightness and warmth that came with the conversation, but I felt a smile spread across my face. “That is indeed very reminiscent of Holmes, for I sometimes fear he may starve to death if I am not around to call on food for him.”
My eyes widened with horror at Holmes’ words. There were few people in our lives together—or apart—that he had willfully sought out to harm, let alone
“I hope to make your acquaintance again soon, wonderful people. But, I must return to my post for the moment. Fare thee well, Captain.” He winked at James, and placed our empty plates at a nearby table to be fetched by a busboy. He left with the same sharp grin planted upon his face as it had been all morning.
“In the years since last we were in contact, Mr. Flint, I have involved myself in many cases aligned with the work yourself and Thomas had started some years ago. I much appreciated your correspondence warning me against it, though I was at first confused as to why you did not send this under your own name.” This made my eyebrows rise, as I had not been aware James and Holmes had at all been in contact in our half decade apart. “In recent months, prior to your departure to Scotland, I uncovered some truths I do not believe you, or anyone in this room, to be privy to.
“In July of last year, I was hired on by Scotland Yard for a case to find the missing daughter of a Peer of the Realm, one Abigail Ashe.” At the name, I heard a sharp inhale from James, as if he recognised its origin. “Whilst the nature of the missing persons case was rather fascinating, I shan’t regale you with it now, as that is not what I find to be most relevant to you. During the initial investigation, I met with the young girl’s father, one Lord Peter Ashe. I visited his home to examine it for any clues, and held a brief interview with him. Of course, I had been made familiar with the name before from a correspondence
. I promise you, I will sit at that fucking station, and if that train does not arrive, I will keep looking. I will leave no stone unturned. I will stay at as many stations as I need to and wait a day, a month, a year, forever, as long as it takes. I made you a promise, when we set off from Georgia. I am not backing down on it.”
The only sign of any discomfort in James’ face was a slight twitch under his eye. “Do you think they made it? Do you think they caught the second transport?”
He sends a bowler hat my way, along with a larger jacket to cloak my form. It was foolish to wear such layers on a warm summer night, but I understood the necessity of it.
James said nothing; I was too shocked to think of anything in response. With one last look at us, Vane took the gun Rackham handed to him and turned around.
“I suppose I owe you a greeting as well, Lieutenant. Or should I say, Mr. Flint,” Holmes said, reaching to remove the blade from James’ grasp. “It has been far too long since last we saw each other.”
“It appears more romantic in its style than other letters between affairing lovers often are in my experience. Other than that, I cannot speak to what holds value here, aside from concrete proof of Lady Hamilton’s affair,” I recorded. The true weight of my reaction was held under a locked safe within my mind. I prayed that my friend could not find the key to it.
Within seconds, the door opened up to reveal Mary and Miranda both in nightgowns, sleep still lining their features.
“Interesting place, this, is it not?” She asked, her eyes distant as she explored the buildings around us. “We did not get many chances to visit Scotland, Thomas and I, though he had family here. Though the smell is much the same, I find it very different to London. There is something different in its air, something that does not strike fear in my heart the way the capital did.” She paused and I watched her extract a halfpenny coin from her purse to give to a street urchin. In a dizzying moment, I recognised this as something I had seen Thomas do, many years ago. Being in Miranda’s presence made me feel ever so close to our friend; for a moment, the loss was so sharp I could scarcely breathe.
“I find your assessment of the Hamiltons to be rather accurate indeed, my dear friend. Regarding Lieutenant McGraw, I imagine his rather standoffish disposition is sourced from some anxiety around his position as Thomas’ advisor. Perhaps, he feels a need to prove himself among the ranks of bureaucracy that he otherwise would not engage with - I assume this may be because of a humble background or an unfortunate experience in the past. Yet, his anxieties are not present enough to disparage his ability to criticise or hold antipathy for many of Thomas’ colleagues. He is certainly a clever man, who says little however observes intently—very much like you, Holmes. He mentioned knowledge of rumours surrounding their home, which may lead me to believe he is aware of the whispers of his and Lady Hamilton’s affair. He did not seem in any way ashamed or defensive of such rumours, rather just angered by their very existence. Within the same breath, he readily defended Thomas, whilst having a simultaneous ambivalence toward his ideas themselves. He appeared less as an advisor to the couple, but a guard dog. Ready to bite down upon a potential threat at any moment. I fear that on this account, the Earl may have been quite correct—perhaps it is that McGraw is indeed the one with the nefarious purpose in this scenario.
There have been many times when I have felt fear while working on a case alongside Holmes. Whether it was at the sight of a monstrous hound lunging at an unassuming, traitorous man, or at the sound of a poison dart coming ever so close to taking my dear friend away from me forever; fear had become my companion nearly as much as Holmes has. I often thrived on it—for Holmes himself had once said that fear is what keeps us alert and careful like nothing else—but I had never felt quite as frightened as I did when observing Lieutenant James McGraw’s face that evening. It was not simple hatred or rage that darkened his features; it was something much deeper, hungrier within him, something that thirsted for blood and vengeance, that made unease shrivel up with pain in my gut. I tried, desperately, to tell myself I did not recognise this look, that I had not seen it in the mirror myself. I failed to do so.
“Let me go.” He did not seem to be able to fight, but was going to nonetheless. I knew that he was; he was not a man to back down, even if he was halfway dead.
better cook than I. But—that leaves us plenty of time for me to regale you with some of my stories of the Captain’s transatlantic adventures! Now, has he ever told you about the time he stole a Spanish ship? Well, I was there, see—”
Silver spoke of many things with us. Stories of his time as a crewmate for a small whaling ship as a young man, stories told to him by friends who were told those stories by mentors, and, most of all, stories of his life with James, who he seemed to have met in about 1897. Much to my disappointment, he did not say
“Doctor,” Rackham interrupted, his voice wary. “I think it best to— to withhold any explanation until you become aware of the situation yourself.”
Silver picked up the letter and paused for a split second—contemplating whether or not to read it?—before handing it back to Holmes.
“Thomas, please,” the man says and it is a phrase so familiar, one that echoes almost exactly a phrase on the night they met, yet now there is something else behind it. Something painful, something dark. Sherlock’s throat feels dry.
“Her father, Lord Richard Guthrie, is the owner of the property, is he not? Remember how I referenced just how wide Peter Ashe’s grasp on British society was?”
In the early evening, James approached me from the chair by the fire I had made my solitary reading spot for the day.
Holmes was, of course, correct. As he said this, it seemed that the situation was simmering down as swift as it had begun. I relaxed into my seat as I watched two men pull McGraw off the officer who had dared make a comment about Lady Hamilton’s virtue. The poor man’s face seemed to be monstrously disfigured by the repeated attacks from McGraw’s fist, and I winced as I could hear the painful wheezing coming from him. It was rather likely that the chap would never be able to maintain normal breath again, unfortunate as it may have been. McGraw, on his part, seemed to have only gotten away with scraped knuckles and a nosebleed, however the look in his eyes made my heart stutter with mute terror. His gaze burned with an intensity that I had never seen in another human being before or since, not even on the other side of the trenches when I served in the war.
“Quite right. You are a detective after all, I should have known better than to assume rumour was enough to incite your interest.” Lord Ashbourne reached into his inner coat pocket to retrieve what appeared to be an envelope. “This is a letter from one of her… paramours. It even has a name attached.”
, he had meant him and Thomas or me and him. I turned away from James for I could not bear to look at him now that I saw him as a mirror to the terrible storm within me.
My eyebrows raised so high that they nearly entered my hairline. Out of all on our table, Holmes seemed to be the only one unsurprised by this revelation.
His sentencing will be decided upon by Judge Reynolds this morning, at nine o’clock in Magistrate’s Court.
As I wrote the name and address that so defined the man I wrote to, I thought of the last time I wrote him letters with updates of a case. An old case, from before the Reichenbach Falls or the tragedy of the Hamiltons, when I sent him updates about the mysterious demon hound haunting the Baskerville estate. I had yet to write up the account of such a case, though now it will be known as my return to publishing Holmes’ biographies. Many people wondered why I chose that story above that of Holmes’ return to mark the end of my hiatus. But, I think it may be safe to say that the reminder I felt in this moment was a contributing factor.
When they came together—with Thomas more or less leaping into James’ arms—it felt as if the entire world stilled and took a deep inhale. Or perhaps it was just us who did so, I am not sure. I knew for myself that I was witnessing a miracle.
“Lion indeed. And, I believe I may have had rather a lucky escape from those sharp claws, dear friend. Have you made any unique discoveries in my absence?” I asked, finally turning my gaze away from McGraw. “If not, I think I may have uncovered some truths of my own.”
Whilst I did not intend to be gathering clues throughout this polite and pleasant luncheon, any studying of her words could not be helped. Working with Holmes had altered the nature of my mind during a case. Perhaps, Lady Hamilton’s separation from her husband in casual social engagements was a sign toward proving the Earl’s inclinations. Though, when speaking of the Lord, Lady Hamilton did not show signs of discomfort or wariness; on the contrary, her tone took on a warm tinge, and she smiled at the mention of his name with great, obvious affection. I felt amoral, hiding these observations from my wife. My trust for her was firm in its standing, and it was plausible that her connection to Lady Hamilton may aid in our investigation. All the same, concerning myself with such discussion was nothing but hypothetical at the moment.
The term of endearment stood out to me in that sentence more than it had in the past. I was unsure how long it had been since last I heard it, and I longed for a distant time when hearing such words was nothing short of normalcy. I reached to his arm, then, and gave him a reassuring shake.
“My dearest Thomas is otherwise engaged today, involved in the planning of his next political venture.” There was something knowing and shrewd about Lady Hamilton’s smile, though I could not fathom what lay hidden behind it. “He does send his well wishes, of course, Mary.”
“Have a seat here.” I pulled one of the dining chairs from the large wooden table and flipped it toward him. As he collapsed into the chair, I could swear I witnessed each of James’ bones expel just a breath of the weariness lining them. I pulled up a seat for myself, and began unpacking my supplies.
I noticed something in James’ voice then, something familiar that I had not heard in nearly six years. As he spoke of John Silver and their complicated bond, a tenderness coated his words in such a way that I was brought back to a conversation in a darkened parlour of 221B Baker Street. I remembered how he spoke of Thomas, and how he bared his soul to me just days after our first meeting in an effort to save the man he loved. Now, whilst a similar weight of urgency burdened us, I saw that very same devotion in him toward Silver.
“Hush, now, Watson. I will explain it all in due time, I assure you. Now, be seated, if you please.” His tone was calm, but intentional, and his voice was in a whisper, as if the words existed solely for my ears—though I doubted Silver and James could not hear it. There was a tenderness emanating from him that made my heart feel alight with emotion I had not felt in ages. I wondered if the intimate nature of it was fabricated somehow—a facade of some kind to make me believe his intentions lay elsewhere from the truth. Why he would fool me in such a manner was even less sensical, but my mind wandered to the possibility all the same. I felt that any perceptions of him I formed in past years were now irrelevant, and the man before me was almost as unfamiliar as the other two in the room.
you knew where we were,” James spoke first. “The last time I saw you, you were vandalising segregated signage in Virginia.”
“Excellent!” she chimed. Upon looking back at her as I put on my boots, I noticed her coat was already in her grasp, as though she knew of my plans before knocking.
suited her ever so much more than Lady Hamilton did. I found that the discarding ceremony was surprisingly easy in the presence of the Hamiltons.
I have known my friend for nearly two decades now, and such an interaction—especially one with nobility—was unprecedented. Something in his mind was directing him to distrust this man beyond his typical disdain for aristocracy. I glanced over at the Earl, only to see a bewildered expression across his face. It remained for a moment, before fading into determination.
“Yes,” I insisted helplessly. “Mary, you know as well as I do that the endeavour is dangerous in every stage that it is in. I am your husband; it is my job to worry after you.”
“Perhaps you are right,” he resigns. “There is a reason for my stubbornness, I suppose, beyond that of my own individual guilt, though I know now that it was nothing but foolish.”
My well known dismay replaced the previous excitement with vengeance at Holmes’ voice. I did not doubt my friend’s abilities, and if his past performances in detection spoke to the current job, it would not be long before he discovered the true nature of things in this house. I thought of Mary, of her new friendship with the Lady that is blossoming just across the room. More so, however, I thought of Thomas Hamilton, and the rigid Lieutenant keeping a well trained eye upon his enthusiastic Lord. Perhaps, I saw such a resemblance between McGraw and myself for more intimate reasons than our military attachments or duty to a more Bohemian colleague. Perhaps, the knowing glances my wife shared with me in the tea room earlier today were not unwarranted in their presence. I could not allow my mind to wander to such absurd possibilities for long however; too dangerous in their nature to suggest on a whim.
James laughed at this, a small, broken, wet sound. His eyes glistened in the dark. “He definitely would. You have spent
The Admiral who was conversing with McGraw just before had stepped in, and ordered all his officers out of the establishment. McGraw himself was still trying to catch his breath as I saw the older man say something to him in a hush, though I could not hear what. Holmes, on the contrary, seemed perturbed by what he had seen of the conversation. I could not quite read the look on my friend’s face, but I could tell that whatever he heard, it unsettled him to his core.
“My, Watson, you quite nearly caught yourself in the lion’s den,” Holmes murmured to my right, as if using my figure as a cover to hide behind, despite being taller in stature.
There was a caution behind his words that I did not recognise. As though the weight of the evening sat upon his shoulders, but the reason for it was unknown to me. Physical violence had not been perturbing to Holmes’ sensibilities in the past, nor the affairs of members of the establishment. His tone reminded me again of my confusion upon his acceptance of this case just a day prior. Why such diligence in a case he would often, otherwise, disregard with contempt, or solve in one evening?
James threw his opponent off to the side but the man still grabbed his shirt and they both tumbled to the floor. “The left one has more scars, he will be more proficient in hand-to-hand combat.”
I startled at what seemed to me a sudden change of topic. “Of course. That day…” My memory from that fateful morning returned to my mind in vivid colour. The pain I felt after that day was only now beginning to mend. “That day is one I cannot forget.”
“Please, be safe,” I insisted, for I could feel the intensity with which my heart was breaking. The fact that my wife and Miranda were the first to enter this new stage in all our lives, this dangerous endeavour to which we had all assigned ourselves to—it sat deep, unpleasant in my chest.
Together, we dragged the table to lie on its side, a makeshift cover for us to crouch behind. My heart was racing wildly in my ears as we knelt behind it and James focused his attention on the approaching footsteps.
“I—” For a brief second, my words caught in my throat. The image already present in my mind replaced one of the poor souls I saw with an image of Thomas. A man such as him did not belong on the dirty floor of a train car, with half his mind left behind. I had seen, first hand, the brilliance he was capable of, and the sheer idea of that being ripped from him was somehow worse than when I had thought him dead. “It is not impossible.”
, Captain, and have I once betrayed your trust? Who do you think was it that convinced Madi that you were to be trusted when you materialised in Savannah out of nowhere? Who was it that stopped Max when she was ready to set her assassins on you? When—” Silver tripped up the stairs and James steadied him with a hand on his elbow. “When Mr. Dufresne was trying his very best to kill you, who was it that split his skull in two?” Silver’s voice lowered to a whisper. “Perhaps you need to get it through your thick head that, at times, I’m the only man in a 100 mile radius that
The authority that Madi Scott held over her men was truly astounding. It was as if she did not need to speak at all to communicate her orders to them—all she did was nod in their direction and they set about to help the other woman free Vane and Rackham from their restraints and to clear up the bodies of our attackers without arousing suspicion to the neighbours of the inn. Mary and Miranda, having seen the danger had passed, finally emerged from their hiding space. Miranda instantly made a beeline for James.
Hamilton: I know little of Viscount Henderson’s personal behaviour, your Honour, but I can say, without a doubt in my mind, that spreading falsehoods of the private lives of honest men is not a new practice among members of the House of Lords.
It was then that I began to understand why it was that my wife had asked for us to meet at the tea rooms, rather than our home. My realisation was allowed to mingle for mere moments, though, as my wife stood to greet the third party, approaching the table with an easy, elegant step. By default response, I stood to greet her as well. The lady that approached us had dark chestnut hair, fashioned intricately with jewellery, and an extensive patterned gown with matching gloves. Her face was kind and bright, a grin upon it that could make anyone feel understood, and the sharp, intelligent look in her eyes was eerily reminiscent of the one I so often met when I looked at Holmes’ face. She extended her degloved hand to me, and I pressed my lips to her knuckles.
“Doctor Watson, hello!” Silver welcomed with a bit less of the—I assumed—trademark glee than he held this morning. So complex an ordeal as this required a bit less charm and considerably more focus. “Please, have a seat.” He gestured to the empty chair beside him, and I sat down to gaze upon the delicate proceedings.
Oh, if only you knew the purpose for my need for romance when writing of you. If you knew of my reasons, it may be possible that you would have said nothing of it. Moreover, you may have taken the liberty of shunning me from your work and home much earlier than now. How grateful I am that such things did not happen then. The decade of happy, innocent work together will live eternally in my memory, with no mention of the E. of A. or the horrific fate of T. H.
Mary, Holmes, and myself sat upon three empty chairs to the Lieutenant’s left, as Lady Hamilton reached her throne-like seat at the hearth. There was easy chatter filling the room and a servant immediately materialised at our elbows with glasses of wine. I focused my hearing on Lord Hamilton’s pleasant, cheerful tone.
reached a verdict of GUILTY toward the defense. Among those on the stand in support of the prosecution, was none other than Lord Thomas Hamilton, heir to the Fourth Earl of Ashbourne.
As disconcerted as I was by this, I was unable to ignore my Hippocratic Oath and therefore I attended the Gaol surgery to inspect the ailments of one Mr. Hamilton. The gentleman in question seemed severely underfed and underslept, which I was informed was due to his recovery from a recent bout of dysentery. I have suspicions as to the truthfulness of this statement as I have known guards at Reading Gaol to refuse food to troublesome inmates. I was asked to examine a head wound of minor severity and that had caused no concussion—a wound that Mr. Hamilton had, reportedly, inflicted upon himself.
Any and all fight that seemed to remain within James was gone with the sheer exhaustion; he simply nodded in agreement. As everyone around the table stood to leave, I heard Madi going up to him and saying in a quiet, gentle voice:
