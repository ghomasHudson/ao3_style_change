“What? What’s wrong? Is he...” she couldn’t bring herself to ask if he was dead.
The taste of his pre cum floods my mouth, and makes me wrinkle my nose. It’s not awful, it’s just a little bitter.
“What about him?”
“Yeah, Alright. Cheers.”
“You sure?”
Sherlock pressed their lips together in a messy kiss before pulling away in a fit of giggles.
“I think I’ve got it.” Sherlock said softly, squeezing the base of John’s cock experimentally.
Sherlock gulped, and shivered. He was so turned on he thought he’d go insane.
He smiles, and nods.
I wish I was able to keep my eyes open, but with my hyperactive brain desperately trying to focus, my eyes close in an attempt to not get distracted by the other sensory events going on around me.
Sherlock furrowed his brows.
“I’m relieved... I thought you were... having regrets... and you didn’t want to see me.”
“Yes?”
“See you Monday.”
John reached over, and touched his hand, not holding it, simply brushing against him.
John pulls back at this, an ear splitting grin appearing on his face as he looks at my expression.
I spin around to face John.
“So?”
“I’m ok. Lucy doesn’t cry in the night anymore. She’s talking now though.”
John grabbed the nearly empty lube bottle from the bedside table along with a condom.
“Hey.”
Fuck! Fuck! Fuck!
“Duty calls.” She mumbled, putting her cup down.
The next day, everyone was hung over. They could only be great full they had no classes. Sherlock was curled up under a sheet, clad in one of John’s jumpers, coffee in one hand, bottle of water and a paracetamol in the other.
He sighs happily before pressing our lips back together again.
Mycroft was the smart one, as he constantly reminded me, as the little voice in my head continues to do so.
I take a quick glance at him, my brain connecting a few dots.
No one else was home.
“I want to see you.”
Sherlock snapped her attention back to the infant in her lap.
He clears his throat, and corrects his posture before handing the book over, gently brushing my fingers in the process. It’s not like how they describe it in the books. It’s not electric, it doesn’t make my heart skip a beat, the Earth doesn’t stop, but it’s something. Something.
He pulls my trousers down, and slips his head in between my legs.
“Ok, give me details.”
This only spurred him on, and increased his pace. This pushed Sherlock over the edge. He emptied ropes of salty, white liquid into John’s mouth, all of which he swallowed willingly. Sherlock fell back onto the bed, exhausted. John moved up the bed, and curled up beside him.
“Alright.” She said after a moment, and followed him into the house.
John was peering at his boyfriend over the sofa, watching as he appeared to be fighting a losing battle with a tin opener.
We go out in to the hallway, and share a parting kiss before going our separate ways.
I cornered him after lunch, dragged him in to the break room, and fucked him against the wall. I had to put my fist in his mouth to keep him from crying out. I slammed in to him, surely leaving dark bruises on his creamy hips.
I bring my arms up and wrap them round his neck, and he pulls me to him by my hips.
We had more spaghetti that night whilst Sherlock tried to explain to me how he got paint on the back of his head.
“But, change is a fine thing.”
“I have to go. But I won’t be out long- oh...” John trailed off when he felt Sherlock’s lips on his chest.
Oh god, that’s hot...
“Hello.”
“I am too. Ok, if you’re sure, then it’s alright with me.” John grinned, leaning in to brush a curl out of Sherlock’s face.
20 minutes earlier
“Thank you.”
“I bloody hope not.”
Sherlock turned to face the blonde, eyebrows quirked in amusement.
Sat on my bed is what someone with more manners than myself would call an unwelcome visitor.
“Would you like to order something?”
John brushed off her apology, and lent in to embrace her again.
“Shit. You’re probably right.” John snickered. “Anyway, are you alright? I didn’t hurt you, did I?
"What is it boys? Here to complain about bullies at your school?"
“Move this chair.”
I feel whatever blood isn’t already down there rushing to my groin.
“What do you have to do with Sherlock?”
Sherlock felt his heart fluttering.
“Piss off.”
“I really thought I wouldn’t for a moment.”
9th of October 1914
“I take it the others aren’t back yet. They would have stopped the humping fest.”
“Thank you, John.” He breathed heavily.
“Ooo...”
That is all I care about.
“Soup?”
Sherlock stood up, and hungrily pressed his lips to Johns. John didn’t care anymore that he could taste himself on Sherlock’s lips, and opened his mouth regardless when Sherlock’s tongue swiped across his lips.
24th of August 1914
(See the end of the chapter for
“Indeed.”
“Oh fucking hell!” He groaned as he felt the tip brush his prostate.
“Mmmmm... that’s hot.”
Johns voice was sharper this time, deeper too.
Sherlock hated playing in to John’s hand, as it were, hated himself for feeling his cock throbbing.
Sorry this is short... most of them will be now, but more frequent.
John kissed her again, and smiled into it this time. When he pulled away, he just stared at her, his eyes running over her face.
Of course my brain can’t just let me enjoy this thought though, as it is accompanied with dread.
Sherlock had been lost in thought since he and John turned on to different roads at the end of the street.
I nod my head in understanding.
Sherlock was coming home for the Christmas holidays, and John had gone to collect her from the station. He was desperate to see her again. He’d missed her so much, and although her letters declaring her loathing for the other children was a great source of amusement, nothing compared to holding her in his arms. His face lit up the moment he saw her get off the train. She ran over to him and practically leapt in to his arm.
“You look so gorgeous.” John moaned, slipping his hands up Sherlock’s side.
John presented Sherlock with a fork, quirking his eyebrows flirtatiously. Sherlock took the fork, and swallowed a mouthful of cake.
I drop back on to the table, my arms splayed about beside me, heavy and boneless.
“Hey, are you ok?”
“Are you Alright?”
“Shhh, no, no. You have to throw it like this...” Garbled John as he tried to prise the dart off of Sherlock.
“John?”
“I can’t loose you.” She placed a hand on his shoulder. “You have to come back. For me.”
“Is this Alright?”
John age: 17
“I’m just going to ummm... clean myself up... wait here for me?” Sherlock asked, tilting his head like a puppy does when it’s trying to read your expression.
“I’ll have another made.”
“What do you do for fun?”
The young woman smiled sadly at her, then went into the hall to fetch her coat.
“Oh.” John chuckled, resting his head against Sherlock’s as he waited for him to shimmy his jeans down. Once they were off, John threw them over his shoulder where they landed in a corner somewhere.
There was only crying.
John worked him open, slow and steady. He added another finger, making Sherlock whimper and grab at the sheets.
“I’m fine.”
“Not now Sherlock.”
I feel her watching me for a moment before she lets out a sigh and jumps down from the table she was perched on.
“You look very pretty.”
The blond pulled back with a sigh, removed his fingers, and turned his attention to the plug.
Friday morning came much to soon for either of them.
16th of June 1913
As she spoke, John couldn’t keep his eyes off her. She had the same beautiful cat eyes as always, that appeared blue and gold from some angles, and almost silver from others. Her hair was longer than before, and fell in neat curls on to her shoulders, framing her face, which had got longer, and more angular. Her figure had filled out, her blouse and skirt advertising the swell of her hips and breasts. She was most definitely a young woman now. Sherlock listened intently as John told her a selection of somewhat sugar coated stories. They were sugar coated not for her sake, but his own. He wouldn’t mention the cold that made you wish you were dead, the huge rats, the grotesque smell, the lice, the bodies, none of it. He couldn’t. His body visibly tensed, his eyes glazing over.
I look in to his steely eyes, and find the next words just tumbling from my mouth before I really think about it.
Thank you for the comments and kudos! ☺️
“Where are we going?”
“We can stay at Mrs Hudson’s.”
“Yes, god yes.”
Sherlock wondered how much her sister had to drink the previous night.
Mycroft was glaring at Sherlock over his newspaper.
It was no longer a warmth, but a blazing heat that made sweat drip down her neck and stick her dress to her skin.
“John... ah...”
During an adrenaline high after winning a match, John asserts his dominance with Sherlock.
“John...?” Sherlock asked softly.
“Would you like me to watch you get yourself off?”
It’s intense, it’s messy, and I’m so spent.
The blanket I had placed around him is twisted between his legs, which kick about, desperate to kick off something I’m sure is more dangerous than the blanket. His head rolls about as his eyes twitch, and small sobs wrack his body.
I’m so hard and I’m not even inside him yet.
Nobody hark at me if my historical knowledge is inaccurate lol 😆
She almost seems like she believes me... just for a second.
“We better get going then.”
You guys like the little paraphrasing there? 😆
“You’ve never done this, have you?” He says after a moment.
His eyelids are fluttering as his eyes flick round the room, trying to distract himself I assume. I jerk my wrist a little faster, and it seems to have a positive effect on John.
He cautiously pushed his cock in all the way, hurrying himself to a hilt.
“What?”
Sherlock dropped his head so his face was buried in johns neck, little noises of embarrassment escaping him.
“You...”
Sherlock had abandoned her heels somewhere in a corner, her curls, now shoulder length, were half tied up in a bun, half hanging over her eyes, and she had been sipping at a glass of Buck’s Fizz in whilst she aimed about four inches away from the board.
He shakes his head.
“I’m gonna go chat her up. Later sluts.”
“Baby, you need to relax. This is going to be really painful otherwise.” John murmurs, his voice strained.
“Thank you, John. I feel a bit better.”
Although, if I am following his intentions correctly, my worry shall become moot.
The doorbell sounded, followed by Mrs Hudson’s ever I even footsteps as she trotted out to the door.
“No.” She said suddenly. “No, John. You killed him, yes. But you did it because you had to. You’re not a murderer. He would have killed you.”
John swirled his tongue around the tip, lapping at the beads of precum.
The sex is fine. We finish, and lie curled up on the sofa in front of the telly.
You cannot outrun death, but you can, however, move the appointment.
“Give him to me.”
“Sherlock?”
Hi guys! Thank you so much for the lovely comments! Hope you enjoy!
“Yeah.”
Sherlock looked up from her tea at Mrs Watson, and nodded.
“Hey.”
“Hey, umm do you want to maybe... go in to the bedroom?”
Euros doesn’t effect me, in fact she plays very little part in my life.
“Did you get a coin from the tooth fairy?”
I screw my eyes shut and grit my teeth as I feel myself reaching my own orgasm and releasing in my briefs.
After John pulled out, he flopped down beside Sherlock.
John momentarily opened his eyes to nod his head, then released his hand. Sherlock continued his movements, base to tip, and up again. He increased the speed, which appeared to have a very positive effect on John.
“Mycroft.”
“No, no, don’t be sorry. I just...” He cooed softly as he leant in, his lips grazing her ear. “Want you to feel just as good.”
Johns age: 19
She wanted more.
She didn’t say anything.
“I’m positive!” John whisper shouted. “Put your head against your wall if you don’t believe me.”
“Yeah, I mean sure. I’ve never done anything... you haven’t... should be ok. As long as you’re sure?”
John.
I can practically see the smug smile spread out on his ostrich-Esk face as he leans back in his chesterfield, his feet propped up on the matching footstool, cigarette between his fingers.
“What time is it?” John asked, voice raw and husky with sleep.
“This is going to hurt, but hopefully it will be worth it.”
Pleased with his reaction, John slowly began to push his finger inside Sherlock’s entrance. Sherlock’s breath hitched, and his stomach muscles spasmed.
"He's a show off."
“Now... off you pop. Back to bed.”
“JOHN!”
She didn’t speak, so he didn’t either.
God I hate myself.
“Good boy.” John sighed.
“Are you Alright?” He asked as he sat himself down opposite John.
On second thoughts, maybe he should ditch the plan and just do that...
I finish dressing, then follow Wiggins and Mike down the corridor to commissary.
Sherlock’s hips bucked up, his knuckles turned white, and his eyes flew open as he reached his high.
“I have to go....”
And I know how it can hurt,
She cautiously placed her hand on John’s other knee, and smiled when he placed his hand over hers. He seemed to have relaxed a little since that morning, the physical pain distracting him from the emotional.
“Mrs Watson?”
“Everything alright? You feeling ok?” John whispered in to his hair as he caressed his hipbone.
I moan loudly, and keen in to his touch.
“I’m glad.” I say with a grin.
“Shall we have this to split?”
“Boys! Dinner!”
“Oh god!”
I’ll never leave your side.
“More... please... oh...”
“Alright. I’ll let her know you send your love. Try and occupy yourself, mmm?”
Mycroft cast a glance to her sleeping toddler before looking back up at Sherlock.
She was nice.
He glared at her again, before burying his head in his hands.
“God, sorry did I hurt you when I hugged you?”
“I can only hope you can forgive me for my behaviour. I was inebriated, and it was fair to say my inhibitions were greatly lowered.”
This landed him a blow to the abdomen. He fell to his knees, hunched over in agony. A blow to the head knocked him out cold.
We exchange an innocent, chaste kiss.
The three of them walked back slowly, Sherlock and John hand in hand, and Rosie trailing along behind them.
John still looks perplexed, his lips slightly parted, eyes wide as he stares at me.
“Of course. Stupid question.” John mumbled, thrusting his hands into his pockets.
“Sherlock? Are you listening?”
It’s no longer months till I get out, it’s weeks.
This was, after all, the first time she’d seen him.
Sherlock’s free hand had been balling the sheets up, but he had since brought it up to toy with his nipples.
Normally, this was an announcement that sparked joy, but this time it was one that only brought dread.
It felt good, but there was still a twinging pain around his ring of muscle that was keeping him grounded.
“Sure. But no, he’s not home. Door knocker’s to the side. He left before I went to school, and hasn’t been back since.”
I suppose my look of astonishment gave it away.
Mrs Holmes bit her lip as she exited.
“Ummm... do you know who’s book this is?” I ask one of the inmates.
Five words.
John and Sherlock celebrate her birthday.
All this sneaking around is like every teenage chick flick ever written, but I won’t deny that it’s also really fucking hot.
“Mmmmm...”
“Sorry, I think there may be a hole in the tea strainer.”
“But... you didn’t even notice me.” Sherlock drawled as he pulled back.
He decided against asking anymore questions, and Just nodded along.
“Oh that’s not cliche at all.” She mumbled as she indignantly shoved a whole teacake in to her mouth.
“Ugh forget it.”
“I fucking love Beyoncé!”
“Mmmmm... sore.”
Sherlock was practically on the verge of tears by the time John managed to free him, and all but collapsed in to the blond’s arms.
“Yes, another time. Where I can bind your hands together, and fuck you from behind.” John grumbled, his teeth scraping the skin where Sherlock’s ass met his legs.
He didn’t need to be told twice, and quickly got to thrusting his hips with abandon.
John eagerly followed the taller teenager into the hall, and up the stairs. There were four doors along the corridor. The furthest one along had a sign that read ‘consider whether what you need is worth knocking for.’ John guessed this was Sherlock’s room. Sherlock moved around him to open the the door, brushing up against John as he did. Sherlock stood aside to allow John through, then closed the door behind them. There was a single bed, unmade, a desk, it’s surface scattered with papers, a few clothes here and there, and a collection of odd items strewn about, such as deer antlers, and conical flasks. They were kinda hard to miss.
He shrugged, and pulled out a cigarette from his bunk side.
“Mol, this is for you as a thank you for letting us have the flat.”
Mycroft lowered both of them to the floor, and carefully pulled the younger boy close.
He wasn’t.
“Alright.”
“Jesus...” he sighed in a cross between exasperation and pleasure as he felt his morning wood press in to the mattress.
“I took them from next door.” He mumbled, turning back to their experiment.
John was leant against the door, a predatory look in his eye.
She brought her face to her hands to dry her eyes on the heal of her palms.
She took johns hand in hers, and placed it on her heart.
He sighed, and slumped back in the bench.
“Is it your sweetheart?” He cooed softly in a non teasing manner as he presented a letter and a parcel.
The dark haired girl inhaled sharply, her attention drifting down to the book in her lap.
When I’m done, I hear him take a long drag on the other end.
“You.”
“I love you too. John.” She added with a chuckle.
“I just have to go and get changed, then ummm... we can get coffee?”
“What?”
"In about two hours... What are you doing?" Sherlock asked when he noticed John leaning in towards him.
“I don’t know... ah!” Sherlock gasped as
I narrow my eyes at him in challenge.
He sighs in content at this.
“Baby, we don’t have to do this.”
Sherlock slowly rose to his feet with a supportive arm from from John, who wrapped him in a blanket, and lead him in to the bathroom.
“Hello-“ I heave, grasping at his shoulders in an attempt to stop myself from tumbling backwards.
“Well, then you might want to try saying please.” He says with a grin and a quirk of his eyebrows.
As I stand up from his lap, his eyes flicker down to my groin. I follow his gaze, and see a still present tent in my trousers.
John bucked his hips forward forcefully, pressing his erection further between Sherlock’s legs. Their bodies were flushed together, hot, and sweaty. John could feel Sherlock’s cock throbbing against his side, tempting him.
“I’ve seen a photo.”
“Yes.” Sherlock purred, licking his bruise kissed lips.
She smiles, and shakes her head.
With his new found courage, he reached for johns hand, and brought it down to the waistband of his underwear.
"Mummy, we're off out!"
“Oh...” Sherlock moaned as he felt a rush of pleasure.
Sherlock was more red than pink now.
“Then stop watching me.”
Tears begin to stream down his face as he squeezes his eyes shut.
“My house after school. Mum and sister are out.”
“What are you doing here?” John asked calmly with genuine curiosity.
The sight of him coming undone and the intense heat of his spasming channel clamping around me just pushes me over the edge.
He grips my shoulders, and I grab him by the thighs, making him jump up so his long legs are wrapped around my waist.
That wasn’t John.
The three girls were all sat up on the floor, trying not to laugh.
“Yes! Oh gaaaahhhd...”
I decide to ask the question that has been burning a hole in my pocket.
He pulled the rather dazed teen in to a kiss, then quickly pulled back, wrinkling his nose.
“Well, you’ll definitely enjoy today.” She says with amusement.
“Mmmm... fuck- oh... are you... are you alright like this?”
The urge to open his eyes was strong, but he resisted none the less.
“Sherlock, sweetheart, what about you?”
Irene winked at them, then disappeared out the door. John carried the bowl of popcorn over, and settled on the sofa. Sherlock went to the bathroom, then took his normal place in John’s lap when he returned. Half way through the movie, he felt Johns fingers slip under his shirt, tickling his skin.
“Baby, are you alright?”
We are to have a good close here. For once, the fires were not started by me. Mother got carried away with the brandy, and the Christmas pudding got out of hand. Your parents and sister are here too. Your mother is rather tipsy, and is singing Christmas carols very out of tune. Our fathers seem to be enjoying the duty of ‘home guard’. I dare say it is not nearly as strenuous as your endeavours. We’re all thinking of you. I miss you.
“I always am John, you should know that by now.”
He watched her go out the door, then sat back in the chair to wait for her. He’d seen her again. She was here, and she still loved him. That was all he could ask for. When she came back a few minutes later with an overnight bag, the other sofa was set up, and Mrs Watson was loitering in the doorway. Sherlock went in to another room to get dressed, then came back and sat herself on her bed for the night.
Sherlock tried to act as though he wasn’t offended, although he definitely felt as though John had just punched him right in the chest. In a way, he had.
“You go first, as this was your idea.” He says with a flirtatious grin.
He dropped an armful of foam football in Sherlock’s arms.
“There’s a cleaner here that never locks the door to his cupboards. He’s always high. Marital problems. Honestly, this school is a disaster.”
“Hi there.”
John age: 20
“You ok?” He asks hesitantly.
“Good morning Sherlock, how are you?” John teased sarcastically.
He had no idea what to say.
Sherlock and his bloody sultry tones...
John felt his cheeks burning up immediately as his mum all but forced a box of condoms in to his hands.
John stares at me with a look of bemusement.
"Alright."
John spun around in his chair, and lent on his hands as he watched Sherlock make tea, the way his muscles moved under his shirt, the way his curls fell over his eyes as he bent his head. When he reached up into the cupboards to get the tea, his shirt rose up, revealing the smallest sliver of pale, smooth skin just above his belt. John quickly adverted his gaze as he felt his cheeks heating up.
“Where are you going?” His father asked, holding out a cup of tea for him.
He pulls out a bundle of white cloth and hands it to me.
Thank you so much for reading... I can’t believe I went on with this for such a Bally long time. Hope you enjoyed!
Visitation is an opportunity for inmates to see their family, and catch up. For me, it’s half an hour of my older brother degrading and patronising me.
“You look just like your daddy.” She told him very quietly as she kissed the top of his head.
JOHN’S POV
Moriarty is clearly very touchy about his height, because the next thing he does, is punch me in the throat. I fall back against the bookcase, coughing and spluttering. I barely have a chance to evaluate how stupid i’m being before his hands are around my throat. It does make sense that being a smart arse is what’s getting me beaten up, but I know this is about something else... there’s no denying that. But I can’t focus on that right now, because I can’t breathe. I can’t breathe. Moriarty has such a tight hold on my neck that my airways are almost completely constricted. I feel like I’m screaming, but I can’t tell. I try to push him off, but my flailing arms are of little use. I feel my eyes watering and threatening to close. I can’t... I can’t-
He searched his brain for an appropriate response, already aware ‘no, I really don’t’ was not ok.
“You are not alone there.”
I push my tongue past his tight ring of muscle. His knees clench around my shoulders and he tugs harshly at my hair as he tilts his pelvis up in to my touch.
Sherlock merely nodded, and took a sip of his own tea.
He did, this time with three fingers.
“Yes...”
“Oh... ooo...ah!”
Sherlock smiled as she bent over to lift her niece.
“Not good?”
“You don’t have to be here, but here you are. I really appreciate it. And I’m sorry for shouting at you earlier.”
I blush.
They looked up to see the athlete stood on the stairs, clad in only a white cotton undershirt, and a pair of boxer shorts.
“Well, I suppose I’ll have to handcuff you. You obviously can’t keep your hands off yourself.” John said harshly, shooting a glare in Sherlock’s direction. The brunette wisely kept his mouth shut, and held his wrists out.
John’s POV
“No... ooo...”
When Sherlock awoke the next morning, she was in her parlour. There was also an ache in her back. That was when she remembered who her mattress was. John was sound asleep beneath her, snoring softly. After glancing at the clock, which read 05:30, she lay her head back down on his chest, and drifted off.
Sherlock giggled as John pulled her to him by the waist, and placed a kiss on her lips.
“Oh, yeah I know about that. Maybe you should stay? Just in case anything kicks off.”
He put the remainder of the cube that was in his hand back in the tray, and set them down on the bedside table.
Comrades.
His expression changes to one of surprise and mild fear.
The war is over
I slowly pull out, making Sherlock whine.
The officer didn't look convinced, and crossed his arms in a stand off with the teenager.
John picked up another forkful of cake, and dipped it in whipped cream before holding it out to Sherlock. The younger of the two furrowed his brows before taking a bite.
Honestly, I am amazed that no one has picked up on this; I suppose it just shows you how self absorbed people are.
She leant back.
“Are you talking about John?”
“Because I’m really annoying, and I’ve either worked with them before, or they’ve heard horror stories, and refuse to work with me. So, if you hear of anyone who’s interested...”
If I’m misreading this, and she is just interested in being friends, then I go and say something stupid, I’ll come off as the biggest jerk who thinks every woman wants to sleep with him.
“I want to be able to look at you. Get your hips up.”
He obeyed, and settled on the bed. He trembled where he sat as John walked over to him, his intense, steely gaze making his cock ache.
John chuckled weekly.
John chuckled as he walked over to Sherlock.
“Nothing.” Sherlock murmured, not looking up when John jumped on to the table.
“Sorry, didn’t mean to scare you.”
“Will coffee do? To drink, not to pour on your brain.
"Because you're a freak!"
Pineapples? Get it? No? Alright 😆
He almost immediately assaults my lips with his, lust a vicious motivator for him to begin thrusting his tongue down my throat.
“You were so good. So well behaved.” John cooed as he unlocked the cuffs.
She kissed him again, for longer this time, and flung her arms around his neck before moving him backwards and pushing him down on to her narrow single bed.
“Mammal is a funny word, isn’t it? Mammal... mammal...”
John moved closer to Sherlock so their bodies were pressed together. He placed his hands on Sherlock’s narrow waist, moving their hips in tandem.
Sorry this is kinda meh and also sorry it took so long. But... sexy times coming very soon.
“Afternoon, Sherlock.”
“Umm, I don’t know.”
“I don’t really.” Sherlock shrugged.
“Fucking hell.”
Sherlock said gently.
“So, need I ask?”
He sounds so small right now, like a child who’s been told off for drawing on the walls.
Oh my god, he’s going again, thrusting his cock in to me with abandon, making my toes curl.
She buried her head in his chest, sobbing freely.
“Yes, they do that, then they come back again. At least let me wake mummy.”
“But I-“
“I noticed.”
“Sherlock.”
“I see.” He says after a moment. “Why?”
“Can I have a piggy back?” Sherlock asked groggily.
“I would like to take these off with my teeth, but I like the way they make your ass look.” John murmured, pinching Sherlock’s ass for good measure.
“Ok, you’re all good. You are free to go. Well not free... sorry. Bad choice of words.”
“Tell me you’re not gay.”
He grinned as he saw Sherlock shiver.
Almost as soon as he’d got through the door, John ran in to Harriet, wrapped in a dressing gown, clearly disturbed by Johns return.
I don’t know why I even bothered that approach.
“We’re not that bad. Not like Irene, anyway.”
Sherlock and john’s relationship gets a little more physical...
I remember just how awkward, rushed, and messy it was, but what I remember more than anything was how as soon as it was over, we quickly got dressed, and hurried back downstairs before anyone noticed we had gone.
John quirked his eyebrows at the brunette in question.
It’s not long before they’re all jostling my sides and taunting me with various jabs and jibes of a certain variety. I make my leave when I can, and go to bus my tray. I keep my eyes down, not sure I’ll be able to look at the guard. No need to add to their theories by swooning. I’m about to leave when I’m called.
Dear Sherlock,
At the table, Sherlock and John had been throwing peas at each other trying to catch them in their mouths. Harriet had found it amusing, where as Mycroft spent the entire time with her eyes rolled.
“Sherlock...”
“I know.” Sherlock chuckled. “I never tried to deny it.”’
“Thank you for taking Sherlock out, John dear.”
John leant in, and whispered in his ear.
Sherlock glared playful at John who discreetly toyed with the remote in his pocket.
Sherlock cut himself off in the middle of a self deprecating ramble, and stared John in the eye.
He looks down my throat, checking for internal damage I assume.
There are many words that could be used to describe Sherlock.
“That’s alright dear. Now, Sherlock, is John staying for dinner?”
Sherlock barely had time to blink before John had crossed the room, and pushed him down on the bed. John was kissing him with fiery passion, lips, tongue, teeth.
“Hey, Hey, are you ok?”
“Yeah ok.”
Harriet? Why was she there? Sherlock entered the parlour, and saw the blonde woman sat on the sofa.
John age: 18
He saluted the tall man before casting a glance to the young boy before him. He had a mop of brown hair, and bright green eyes. He had to be at least 16, but he didn’t look any older than 12.
John grit his teeth as he realised she was right.
“Me either. Now, we can only hope that it won’t be that long.”
Unsurprisingly, it was about John.
“What have you got under that?”
“I’m a little cold. I’m just going to fetch my dressing gown.” Sherlock said, then left the room.
John didn’t know how to respond to this, so he simply offered a curt nod, lips drawn in to a taut line while his mother returned to the kitchen.
“A good old spanking normally sorts out little sluts like you.”
“Shit.”
“Are you trying to undress me? How dare you sailor?!”
I gently reach out, and caress his cheek.
“You really aught to hold him.”
Sherlock quaked beneath John, and sunk his nails in to his back.
“Oh, do stop that children.” Mrs Hudson exclaimed, her hands on her hips.
Mycroft refused to make eye contact as she spoke, and kept her gaze on her daughter instead.
“This ok?” John murmurs against my cheek.
“Are you sure?”
They curly haired brunette looked over to John, who was looking at him with his big, grey orbs.
“I will see you in the morning, babe.”
“Well, I thoroughly enjoyed that.” I parrot.
“Watching Jeremy Kyle is not a hobby.”
“Then no.”
This was happening.
Sherlock felt the girls staring at him as they waited for his answer.
Sherlock’s whole body quaked, his nerves on fire.
“Understandable.”
The small, purple blemishes of track marks on his arms are unmistakeable.
“Be my guest.”
Oh ok.
“This ok?”
“I’ll go up to the shop.” Sherlock said as she walked in.
“I don’t think that’s a good idea.” John said, pulling Irene back into her seat.
“You know you’re the only person who still calls me that?”
Johns cock was hot, and pulsing inside Sherlock’s mouth, pre cum tricking on to his tongue in a steady stream.
Sherlock drew his bottom lip in between his teeth, and nodded for John to undo his shirt.
However, that didn’t mean she was prepared to do it.
Her voice was cold as she stared down at the floor.
Well, as much as wanking in a confine space at work ever does.
The morning after.
John started to pump his fingers in and out of Sherlock’s warm channel. After a few moments, Sherlock relaxed.
She took a drag before immediately spluttering and coughing.
“Yeah. Yeah, I’ll text him.”
“Yes?”
He squirmed and made a little squeak.
The coffee, dark and bitter, but sweetened with sugar brings me warmth as it washes down my throat.
A scream from upstairs had them both jump to their feet, and run out into the hallway.
“Am I really the love of your life?”
“I do understand, I suppose.” I say after a moment, my gaze now drifting to the floor. “I... I guess he just didn’t want me to end up like...”
“Look, I’ve wanted you for a long time, the only thing that had me deterred was the knowledge that I wouldn’t be able to hold you afterwards, kiss you gently, tell you how much I love you...”
“You can’t just run away after saying something like that!” John called after her as he followed her out in to the garden.
“Sure.”
“Yes...”
“Oh!” He cries out, involuntarily bucking his hips up.
“Stop me at any point, ok?”
“Mycroft? Telephone for you.” Mrs Hudson called from inside the house.
“Well, I guess what we do doesn’t matter now.” John shrugged, and made his way to the kitchen, Sherlock following close behind.
“Well, the missus and I have got theatre tickets today, but we’re in town till Wednesday morning. How about dinner Tuesday night?”
Sherlock made some cooing noise of acknowledgement, blissfully content. John pressed a kiss to the sweet spot under Sherlock’s jaw before going back to working his fingers in to Sherlock’s dark tresses.
“Knowing that is what’s keeping me going.”
“I’ll leave you boys in peace.”
He nuzzles his nose against mine, then rests his head against my chest.
“How dare you use your fingers to get yourself off?” John snapped, cracking the whip against Sherlock’s ass.
“I have an idea.”
“Will He be joining us later?” Sherlock asked, taking a sip of her tea.
I can’t say I always liked it.
“I love you.” He whispered against the blond’s lips, hardly breaking the kiss.
Sherlock wasn’t normally one to back away from confrontation, but she wasn’t use to being the objective of this sort of male attention, and found herself backing away to stand behind john.
“So you’re unattached. Just like me. Good.”
“Is that ok?” John asked, as Sherlock had left that bit out.
“She’s my childminder. Well, she used to be. She lets me hang out up here.”
“John...?” Sherlock drawled as he caught sight of himself in the mirror.
Knife. Back.
“Look at her hands! Of course she’s shagging the dog walker!”
“You could spank me.”
“Nothing. Merely an observation.”
“You’re cute.”
“So I’m thinking that... I’m going to... for a lack of a better way of putting it... fuck myself... but you’re going to stay here.”
“Yes, Indeed.”
“Did you tell him that?”
“Yes. Ah, mmm...”
Sherlock fell forward, knocking John backward on to the bed in the process.
He turned to look at Sherlock, who simply shot him a coy smile, and popped a grape into his mouth.
“Well I’m here.” Sherlock said slowly.
She’d stopped being skittish around him now.
“Where?”
After a split second of hesitation, John leaned down, and placed a kiss on one of Sherlock’s rosy cheeks. He pulled back, and left without another word.
“You’re right.”
He wipes his mouth on the back of hand and shudders.
One would have thought a sixteen year old wouldn’t need to be told to share, but Sherlock had always been a little different.
“Umm, I think that’s none of your business.”
“Yes?”
“And who’s fault is that?” Sherlock giggled, turning his head to kiss John full on the lips.
As John moved his mouth up and down, all the crazy crap Sherlock had done last year sprung to mind. He’d had nothing to do with the Nair in the body wash, albeit he was rather fond of the results, he still wanted to come up with his own prank. A brilliant slash evil plan came to mind as he listened to Sherlock’s cries of pleasure.
John started with slow, shallow thrusts, allowing Sherlock’s body to adjust to his length. Said boy had his palms against the door, nails raking the surface. John gradually picked up the pace.
was John.
I step towards him, and press a chaste kiss to the side of his mouth.
Monday. Date with John. Was it a date? It was definitely with John. It was definitely Monday. *thump* Head in the clouds, Sherlock walked straight into a lamppost, and tumbled backwards.
Sherlock felt panic creeping up on him again.
“Mmm.”
Sherlock pulled back, and looked away in contemplation.
“What’s wrong?”
“Sorry about her. Can’t control her emotions.”
He watched as John took out the blindfold. John carefully tied it around Sherlock’s head, making sure he couldn’t see anything. John was always so gentle with him. That was of course until his soul purpose was to be harsh.
“What’s wrong Mrs Hudson?” Sherlock asked, turning her head towards the kitchen.
“Yes, sir?”
Hope you guys enjoy this. I hope it’s not too out of character for Sherlock. Mycroft did once say he was a very emotional child on the show, so... also, he and John talk about their feelings in the next chapter. ;)
“That... I... you really do like me?”
Sherlock wiped his eyes on his sleeve, and looked up at his favourite teacher, although there wasn’t exactly much competition.
“Well, it’s like a battle scar.”
“Holy shit.” Sherlock shuddered, his jaw dropping slightly.
"Congratulations, you two may actually have half a brain cell between you."
A knock on the door has us exchanging worried glances.
Sherlock’s whimpers beneath me in his hypersensitive state as I fill the condom with my load.
“But I have a feeling you have an idea.”
“Well I think so.” Sherlock grinned as she moved to lean against johns arm.
Sherlock chewed the inside of his cheek.
“You sound like waiter full of fake compliments.” She chuckled.
“Yes, yes. Do it again. Don’t you dare stop this time.” She groaned as she pulled him back down to her.
“Frustrated might be a better word to describe this.” He chuckles lightheartedly, leaning towards me and allowing his head to rest on my shoulder.
And just like the acid, words of her big secret came creeping up her throat and escaping her lips, spilling out in to the room for everyone to see.
“Watson.”
He groans quietly, and closes his eyes as he runs his hand over his length.
They paused for a moment when they reached the top of the stairs.
Both his parents frowned at each other.
“That was so fucking sexy.” John sighed honestly, his cock throbbing even more than before, clearly Sherlock cumming in his pants was a real turn on for him. Sherlock looked up at him with wide eyes, his cheeks flushed, his lips glistening with saliva.
‘Give me your confession saying, lately life’s been tearing you apart,
“Oh, god!” John groaned, his hand fisting Sherlock’s hair.
“Sherlock, if you go with your mother, I’ll play chess with you.” Mrs Hudson said, crouching down to be eye level with the small child.
“You fucking... tease.” John panted, throwing his head back.
“Awww, is my poor little girl hungover.” Mrs Holmes chided.
“I can drive you boys to school to save time if you want.”
I hadn’t noticed I had started rocking my pelvis against him, but he clearly had.
"This is like the spider man kiss." John mused as he pulled back.
I pull away and draw a deep breath.
“Oh god-mmmmm...” He moaned, balling the bed sheets up in to his fists.
“Thank you Mrs Hudson.”
“I did.”
“What oh, George.” A blond man said in passing.
Sherlock nodded in agreement as she walked over to where the infant was lying in his basket which was set on the table.
“I have a right mind to pour that tea in to your lap, John.”
“Mmmm...” She moaned happily as John ran his hands down her abdomen.
“What?!”
“Oh, you’re the best. Thank you so much!”
His voice is just above a whisper, but I hear him.
Short chapter, but I have a saucy chapter planned. Comment if you’d like me to publish it tonight :)
“Come on then. You still need to eat your waffles.”
Harry beamed at him then.
I nod and lean in to kiss him again.
John looked up at her with sincerity, his gunmetal blue eyes wide.
“Can we do it without, actually?”
Mrs Holmes turned to regard her eldest son, who had since moved off the doorframe and was hovering by the fruit bowl.
“I don’t know what names John likes.”
“We won today-“
“At least now I know why you never fancied me.” She teases lightheartedly, a grin on her face as she squeezes my arm.
He snarked, being sure not to sound too malicious. John chuckled, and despite himself, Sherlock found himself chuckling too. After a moment, John sighed deeply, his gaze darting between Sherlock and the wall behind his head.
“Because I care what you think.”
“Alright, I’m really going this time. Love you babe.”
He’s already hard, and so am I.
Paying attention is difficult.
“But I can. Could have. If I hadn’t taken anything.”
Sherlock felt a wave of confidence hit him, and grabbed John by his tie to pull him down to his lips. It was tentative, and sweet, their mouths opening slowly to allow their tongues to gently caress one another. When they broke away, they were both breathing heavily.
What he said in ASIB, I get the sense he’s not a virgin... anyway, enjoy!
“I don’t concern myself with trivia.”
“Your blood pressure is a little high.”
Sherlock shrugged it off, and changed the subject.
Mycroft peered round the door to see the younger girl slumped against her headboard, her eyes droopy and bloodshot, her hair akin to a rats nest, and the bags under her eyes sunken, and dark.
“I know. That’s why I told you.”
"Shall I call Mycroft?"
The song changed suddenly, to ‘sanctify’ by ‘years and years’.
“Mmmm... ngghh....” He groaned when he felt one of Johns fingers slip inside of him.
“God, I want to be inside you so bad.”
“Her coats gone. If he is still doing stuff, it’s on his own.”
“You sure?”
“If we’re not there the second his train pulls in, I am going to-“
Sherlock wasn’t quite sure what she should say. Their nearest and dearest knew of course, but that was it.
“John, this is Rosie.”
“We don’t have to get up, do we?”
He smirks, and runs his tongue over his teeth.
They began wandering down the corridor, down to geography which they had together.
John crouched down beside her, and placed his fingers on Harry’s pulse point.
“I will not.” Sherlock had said dismissively and then turned to John. “Now, Dr. Watson, don’t be late.” Sherlock had nodded at David and had started to push through the double doors before turning. “I need you to pick something up for me, Doctor.” He had slipped his hand into an inner pocket and pulled out a small folded piece of paper. “Bring it to the flat.” He had tossed it over and John had caught it. Before he could say anything, Sherlock had left.
John was in shock for a few more minutes before speaking up. “Well, I’m sure you gathered that from David.”
“Sherlock!” John yelled. He looked at the boy, now openly weeping, and made to go help him, but then he turned his head back to look at the place where Sherlock disappeared. “Mrs. Hudson! Ring the police! Don’t touch this vial! And get this boy home!”
He took his mug and went to sit on the uncomfortable chair again. He sighed for the third time as he sipped his tea. This was going to be interesting.
Sherlock ignored him and kept rummaging through the pocket before triumphantly pulling out a folded piece of paper. He unfolded it and frowned.
Sherlock stopped talking when another bicycle bell rang. He suddenly bolted upright and ran down the stairs. John blinked, perplexed. He walked to the window and saw a man running away from the building.
John realized with embarrassment that he was staring for far too long and so forced himself to approach Sherlock and carefully began to undo the gauze. His fingers were quick and efficient, but his right pinky grazed a stretch of skin and it sent a tingle down John’s spine. He frowned. Why was he suddenly feeling awkward? He was a doctor. He had seen hundreds of people naked, for goodness’ sake. He shook his head. He breathed deeply and returned his focus to the wound. He could feel Sherlock’s eyes on him and he felt his cheeks go pink. Finally, the last bit of gauze fell away. John lifted the cotton patch carefully and saw that the bleeding had stopped. The edges of cut skin were scabbed over well and there was no sign of infection. He cleaned it with some alcohol and Sherlock didn’t even twitch. His eyes stayed on John. When John was done, Sherlock was already putting his robe back on and turning toward the kitchen.
?” He hissed.
“Landlady. A bit hysterical. Ignore her.” Sherlock said as he bent over a large machine with a bulbous glass dome and a lightbulb inside. He quickly tapped some keys on a large typesetter and the lightbulb flashed with each letter typed. Sherlock then stood straight, walked out the door, and ran down the stairs. The front door slammed shut.
“Pretty impressive, eh?” David had smirked and then slapped John on the back. “I’ll ring you for dinner sometime. Good seeing you, John. And good luck.”
“Oh, no, dear. Thank you but I must be off.” She pushed the tray into his hands. “You enjoy and save some for Sherlock. I do worry about him sometimes. He’s so thin. But now that he’s got you, well, I’m sure things will be much better now. They always say that you gain a few at the beginning of a new relationship. It’ll do him a world of good, I dare say.” Mrs. Hudson smiled and winked at him then patted her hair distractedly before disappearing out the door. “Toodle-loo, John!”
“John, mate, you made it.” David smiled broadly as he stood to greet him. They shook hands cordially for a moment, smiling politely. They looked at each other a moment longer before joining in a friendly embrace. “It’s been too long.”
“Oh, no, the room isn’t here. I just want you to meet the bloke who’s renting it out. He works here. Sometimes. Well, when he needs to.” David glanced up at a tall pristine white building just a block away. “We’re nearly there.”
“A scar is nothing.” Sherlock rolled his eyes at John’s stern, doctor-mode face. “Very well.” He untied his robe and John wasn’t prepared for the long expanse of pale, smooth skin before him. It had a warmth to it. It was beautiful and riddled with scars.
needed to end.
“Ah. Yes, you’ve been abroad.” Sherlock went to lie on the couch and began fiddling with a wooden box.
“A miscalculation. New Scotland Yard’s finest are worthless cretins. Lestrade naturally came to me. A rare watch was stolen. At first, it seemed that it was just another boring theft. I don’t do theft cases. So dull. However, then a woman’s ear with an earring still attached was found precisely where the watch was last seen.” Sherlock became more animated. “The ear itself was nothing spectacular, but the earring held a poison which is extremely rare and nearly impossible to detect. Therefore I-“
“Um, no.” John said, perplexed. “I was shot in the leg.”
Sherlock spun around with a big smile on his face that looked eerie and a bit unsettling. “Stolen watches! Severed ears! And
“He’s a doctor?” John smiled, thinking it might be nice living with another doctor. Though maybe he was one of those doctors who liked to modify more than truly heal. John hoped not. He had had his fill of those kinds of doctors before and during the war as well. Those doctors preferred to cut out a soldier’s damaged but healable eye and replace it with a glass monstrosity that promised 40/20 vision. He could still hear that lad’s screams. John frowned at that particular memory.
Now, as John sat in the uncomfortable chair, he pulled the box from his waist coat. He had forgotten to give it to Sherlock earlier. He set it down on the side table and went to explore his bedroom. After a few hours of tidying up and setting up his room just like he liked it, he headed to the kitchen to make some tea.
“Uh, um…” John stammered a little, more shocked than ever, but he had to admit, he did need the room and this chap was, in all sense of the word, brilliant. He was intimidating and sharp and frankly sounded a bit nuts, but he was still brilliant. John was entranced. “Yes. Um, yes. Great. Yeah.” John blinked a few times before he remembered to introduce himself. “Oh, and my name is John Watson. Dr. John Watson.”
“What?! Sherlock, what the hell are you on about? What murder? Sherlock! SHERLOCK!”
Mrs. Hudson, who had stayed near her own door, hurried outside with quick little clacks of her heeled house slippers. She looked at the poor child who was still on the ground crying and then peered down the street. “John? John?” She shook her head, “Oh goodness, where did he go?”
David smiled wider and pushed open the doors. John stepped in and immediately noticed two things. First, this was indeed a lab stocked full of glass beakers, odd metal contraptions, and jars full of chemicals. Second, there was a dark figure hunched over the main table in the middle of the room, looking at small glass plates very closely. The figure didn’t react to the intrusion.
The boy’s eyes were still spilling with tears and his nose was leaking but he finally whispered. “Yes.”
The man did not move from his bent position for several seconds. John was about to open his mouth when the man spoke, low and calculated. “What war?” John remained silent, taken aback by the sudden question. The man spoke again. “What war?”
While waiting for the tea to steep, John opened the icebox to see if there was some jam and scones but instead found, to his mild horror, three detached eyes floating in some kind of bright yellow solution and several entrails. And the giraffe brains. He quickly shut the door and sighed.
He breathed out slowly. “That’s a-“
John blinked. “Yes. Of course. Uh, Sherlock. Wh-What happened last night? I didn’t think that a detective had such…an exciting career.”
“I know this.” He whispered to himself, then he said it louder. “Sherlock, I know this type of bomb. Not in this shape, but the concept is the same. I’ve had to disarm a few in the war.”
Thank you for reading!
“Um, Serbia.”
Sherlock snorted. “I’m a consulting detective. Surely, even you have seen the penny papers.”
John stopped rubbing at his thighs and looked up. “How did- “ He started but then paused, staring at Sherlock who stared back. “Sometimes, yes. It’s just a phantom pain.”
“Hey!” John yelled and the men turned their heads quickly in surprise.
When he finally came back to his senses, John swallowed half the scones, chugged his tea, and paced around the flat for half an hour before deciding it was time for bed and time to end this crazy day. As he got ready for bed, he found that taking off his brace in the high bed was going to be a daily chore. It took him several minutes to position it right so he could unscrew the bolts and remove the contraption. He flexed his leg and rubbed at the sore spots that formed from the metal pushing against flesh. He would have to get a lower bed frame, when he found a job and could afford it.  Whenever that was. He grabbed his book and looked at the wall clock. It was almost 10 o’clock and Sherlock still hadn’t returned. Just as well. Perhaps John could still have the peace and quiet of living alone with the benefit of cheap rent in the city. And it was
John blinked and stood there for a bit longer, and just like this morning, wondered what the hell just happened. “Right.” He said to the empty flat. He strolled over to the lone chair in the living room and carefully removed a box of iridescent insects as big as his hand. He sat down and immediately hated the chair. The firm leather was uncomfortable and made him feel like he was sitting on stone. He’d have to get a nice plush chair in the near future. The army had beaten simplicity and order into him, but he allowed himself to indulge in a good chair. He looked around. The flat was actually very nice and welcoming, if you took out all the odd contraptions and dead things. And the venomous snake now crawling up the faucet. John shook his head. What
“So, you’re not a doctor?” John had asked earlier that morning at the lab. Sherlock’s eyes had continued to look at him with a glimmer of amusement.
“Alright, John?” Sherlock said as if in greeting, with no indication that what just happened was absolutely fucking mental.
“Come along, John!” Sherlock shouted back happily, not looking back. “Adventure awaits!”
John ground his teeth. “I’m asking what the hell happened that you almost died from arsenic poisoning?” He said this a little harsher than he meant to.
The man’s eyebrows rose and his reserved smile got wider. “Interesting.” He flipped a small lever on the side of his goggles and a hiss of steam escaped the contraption. He reached behind his head and pulled at the straps before lifting the goggles off his face completely. John’s heart skipped a few beats as amused, intelligent, and rather striking pale blue eyes blinked at him. The man held out an elegant hand and John shook it a bit distractedly as he continued to stare.  “Holmes. Sherlock Holmes.”
John looked at Sherlock incredulously for a few seconds and then spotted the little smirk on his face. John stared at him longer and then, like a switch, they both burst into a fit of giggles. After a moment, John made to walk and groaned as his feet began to ache and sting horribly. His knuckles were throbbing from the punch and he feared he might have broken something. He moved over to a dilapidated, moldy cement fountain that jutted from the wall and he sat down gingerly on the edge. As he inspected his feet, Sherlock crouched close to the still-conscious but in very much pain larger man. Sherlock suddenly stuck his hand into the front pocket of the man’s trousers. John gasped, appalled. “What are you
I arch my hips off the cushions to meet his thrusts, and let out a low whine as I murmur words of love back to him.
“Umm... no-“ I cut myself off when I feel his lips decent to the sensitive buds, which immediately perk up under his tongue.
I disentangle myself from Sherlock to reach over for the condom.
“You ok to keep playing?” John rumbled, his voice harsh and thick as it lapped at Sherlock’s ear.
She couldn’t believe he was coming home.
“I think the best way to do this would be if you propped your hips up on pillows.”
“Chemistry, maths, physics, and biology. You?”
“I know last time was hard, but we managed before, and we’ll manage this time.” John said softly, squeezing her hand between his.
“I suppose you’re right. Do you wanna ask your mum then?”
He leant in to nose at Sherlock affectionately, then peppered his cheeks with soft kisses.
The song was still playing over the speakers situated in the corners in the room.
He quickly jumps up, and crosses the floor in three quick strides.
“She cried a bit, but I got her to stop.”
“Hey, I know you two went in here... even though I can’t see you... ummm... there’s like cake? And ummm you have to be there... I don’t...” she murmured before departing down the corridor.
“You really are your mother’s daughter, aren’t you. Mycroft always did have a weakness for cake.”
“Holmes, a moment please.”
He looks away for a moment as if in contemplation.
“Kiss me.”
John’s breath hitched. He swallowed thickly before nodding his head.
Mycroft’s wedding day, and everyone else becomes aware of the feelings John and sherlock have for each other. Except John and Sherlock...
Sherlock mewls in pleasure, and grinders his pelvis in to mine.
“No. The woman who let you in owns it.”
“So, John are you two going to pop to yours for a change of clothes?” Mrs Holmes asked.
“You ok?”
I cum hard deep inside him, causing him to scream.
Oh fuck.
“Oh Christ.”
The brunette turned to look at him with a look that John had learnt meant ‘I’m gonna kill you in your sleep’.
“You’re welcome.” He sighs, still slightly bemused.
“Where are you John?” She wailed.
If nothing else, Sherlock’s birds’ nest of hair was a dead give away on what they’d been up to, that and the dark blemishes covering his entire neck and torso.
“Mother.” Sherlock muttered, clearly desperate for her to leave.
Now, let’s see how many synonyms for groan I can find... lets venture.
“I love you. I assure you, I am not upset. I see your reasoning, and I completely understand.”
Sherlock chewed his lip in contemplation. He leant in, and pressed a kiss to johns cheek.
“I want that too.”
Sherlock rolled back onto his front, propping himself up on his elbows.
John pressed a kiss to Sherlock’s inner thigh, then sauntered over to the door and shot a wink in the brunette’s direction before disappearing round the door.
“Shit...”
It had been a tedious day of cleaning the bunks.
She grabbed johns hands, and brought them up to her still clothed chest.
“I’ll miss you.” Sherlock giggled against johns lips.
I hate opening my eyes, and seeing the empty space beside me. Empty, alone, empty, no one, no body, empty, empty empty-
Sherlock chortled.
“No where. Somewhere. Anywhere. You’re going somewhere.”
“Shit! My shifts at an end.”
He smiles.
Oh...
He steps closer.
“Mmm... Thank you very much for that.”
As I walk, I feel as though I have some sort of craving for John just nagging at my insides. I suppose I can put that down to my dream.
Enjoy! Who wants smut in the next chapter?
“It’s nice to see him have company.” Mycroft paused before settling on that word, raising his eyebrows at Sherlock.
“Is this what it’s like to be you?” John asked, clattering the weapon into Sherlock’s.
“Yes.” She said, turning to meet his gaze. “It’s not easy. Apart from you, nobody ever understood me.”
Yes, yes he is.
He saw Sherlock’s caller ID pop up on his phone, still buzzing away on his bed side table.
“Just thinking about the homework.”
She spun around, and there, standing at the gate, was John. He was standing up, his wheelchair no where to be seen.
“What are we gonna do?” He asks.
What she was ignoring was an actual being.
“You heard me.” I blurt, not able to keep things under anymore.
“Shit, these sheets are a mess.”
“I like it very much.” John took a step towards Sherlock, and slipped his arms around his waist. “Very, very much.”
“Did you bring it?”
John found the jam enclosed in the parcel.
At first I think maybe he didn’t hear me, but his delayed, somewhat abrupt deliverance of the word ‘fine’ makes me think he may just be the opposite.
Sherlock chuckled, and tried to shy away behind the curtain.
“Lights out at 10 Please, Sherlock.”
He said, shaking the hand of his Field Marshal. John knew he should be happy at being promoted, but it was meaningless. Sure, he had more privileges, but did it really mean anything? He was still just a soldier, fighting in a war. Away from his family. Away from Sherlock. God, he missed her.
Niceties are a thing of the past, the desperate lust for one another taking the front seat in both our minds as we rid each other of clothing.
John age 9
My parents, and Mycroft... Bloody hell, Mycroft? are all standing outside, waiting for me.
“Bathroom at Subway. Yes, we did get thrown out.”
Sherlock stood awkwardly in the middle of the room, unsure whether John was mad at him or not. The pair ate their dinner, the atmosphere clearly having changed. There was a lot of unspoken tension, questions, and answers floating in the air. Although all the topics were brought about by Sherlock, John was more than happy to respond. The distance between the pair had increased, and were sat on either ends of the sofa instead of in the middle, another sign of the awkward situation. John put the telly on again, a sitcom about a police department. Sherlock found the jokes and humour rather enjoyable, and did his best to pay attention.
Sherlock gets devistating news
“Hello.”
“Cum for me then.”
Once Sherlock was accustomed, John settled into a rhythm, rocking his hips back and forth.
Their bodies moved together, hot, and sweaty, tongues fighting, hearts pulsing.
Sherlock draws his bottom lip between his teeth, and turns to look at me, his focus going in and out.
Dear john
He sat down on the bed by Sherlock’s side, and pressed a kiss to his forehead.
John gave Sherlock one last warning look, then his features softened.
(See the end of the chapter for
“For being there, really.” John shrugged.
“Get your legs open. Hips up. That’s a good boy.”
“Yes. I want to.”
Sorry this is short... enjoy!
“Yes, it’s just this flaming corset.”
In my dismay, I fail to notice the transaction going on between Moriarty and Sherlock on the walk back.
“And you, Mrs Holmes.” Harriet said, flashing a toothy grin that showed off her pearly whites.
“You Alright dear?”
He shuffles a little closer before lowering his head, and taking my dripping cock in to his perfect mouth.\
John stood before her, arm extended towards her. Although she’d never say, Sherlock was very fond of dancing, and would often practice in the drawing room to the tunes of ‘Yankee doodle’ on the gramophone.
“I promise I won’t lie to myself anymore. But umm... can we keep this between us for now?”
Tears were falling freely from both their eyes by this point.
“I want you, John.” Sherlock husked by his ear. “I want your cock. I want it inside of me- ah!”
“I want to touch you where you’ve never been touched.” John husked.
“Moriarty.” A voice says.
“Oh god...”
“Why would you do that?” I ask cautiously, trying not to get too excited about it all.
John finally caught sight of his scantily dressed boyfriend.
Sherlock could barely hear him over the thrumming of her own heart ringing in her ears.
“John and his mother have got into a fight, and I thought he could stay the night.” Sherlock drawled, tilting his head to look at his mother.
“You could have phrased that better.” Mycroft yelled through the phone.
“Yes. I promise I’ll keep you updated.”
I follow him across the grounds and over in to the greenhouse.
Fuck, where did he get a knife?
Sherlock yelped again when another splash of water hit him square in the face. A few attacks later, and Sherlock was beside himself with laughter while John just watched him with an amused smirk on his face.
“I saw your face when moly said she’d make a statement. He really seems to matter to you.”
She was racking her brain for an answer when she started singing.
“We’ll be off then. See you on Tuesday.”
“I’m better. They need me back.”
“What have you done?” John asked cautiously, taking a quick taste of the white substance in the sugar pot before sprinkling it on his cereal.
I don’t engage in any of the trivial chatter exchanged around the table until I’m forced in to a very much unwanted discussion by Wiggins.
After work, we get changed, and meet in the corridor.
John took a moment to catch his breath, then reached over to his bedside table to grab some tissues and wet wipes.
Sherlock looked up to him with tear filled eyes. A train whistle blew in the distance.
He opened his mouth to say something, his lips quivering. He closed his mouth again, unable to get the words out.
“We’re not animals.” John chortled choosing to ignore the evidence behind Irene’s statement, and the look of amusement on his boyfriend’s face.
“Yea Thanks.”
“Didn’t you say you had to be somewhere at four?”
“Night, John.” The brunette grinned as they connected their lips in a parting kiss.
“Ok.”
“Shut up. What did you take?”
“That’s for being impatient earlier.” He rumbled, his voice husky.
Why am I still saying it?
“Oh, hey Sherlock. This is Rosamund.” John said gesturing to the blonde.
“You were very good, baby.”
“Is everything ok?”
“You alright?” I tease, running my hands through his curls.
“Pleasure to meet you. I’m James, but my friends call me Jimmy.”
I’m no stranger to waking up with an unwanted erection, but I am new to having one due to desire.
She wasn’t really angry at John, she was angry at the situation.
“Oh Jesus Christ...”
Sherlock’s moans got louder and louder as the minutes went by, as did johns. The blond came to the conclusion that he needed to pace himself if he wanted this to last. He felt loose enough to try the vibrator. He grabbed the green object with a shaky hand, and brought it up to his hole.
oh, oh, oh.’
“SHERLO- AH! NNNGGGHH!” John cried out before biting down on Sherlock’s pale shoulder as he felt his orgasm hit him.
“A very special shop where we’re gonna buy clothes that make you feel sexy, and John cum in his pants.”
They both broke free of their trance, and quickly jumped up from the bed. John trailed behind Sherlock into the kitchen where Sherlock’s mother stood taking a pizza from the oven. They washed their hands, then happily sat down to eat.
This is gonna be fun.
He looked ever so tempting like this, his skirt lifted just enough to show off his bright red panties. Bright red.
John and Sherlock chuckled as they located the cupboard in question.
“Gone shopping; out of bread (and vodka). I, R, and M.” John read from a note on the fridge.
“You free Monday?”
“Yes please.”
“Bedroom?”
“Fuck, you really are something else, aren’t you?”
He’s already hard.
“I mean the new weirdness. Like the... frogs.”
When John was 14, and Sherlock was 10, a boy from their school was killed in an accident. The boy lived across the street, and they often saw him playing with his sisters in the yard. John remembered watching with Sherlock out his bedroom window as the police walked up to their house.
John silenced him with his mouth as he crashed their lips together. He ran his hands up Sherlock’s back, then gently clawed at his skin as he dragged them back down.
“Yes!” Sherlock howled as he rocked faster and faster, making his kitten ears bounce with the motion.
John came over to play chess on the odd occasion he’d done his homework before Sherlock’s bedtime.
“No.” John said offended. “Mrs Hudson did.”
It wasn’t the first time that Sherlock had been awoken by a babies’ cry. She had a niece after all. It was, however, the first time that the baby was crying out for her.
Sherlock had been looking forward to school for one of the first days in a long time. He actually had a friend. He had people he considered friendly acquaintances, and although he didn’t mind their company, he wouldn’t seek them out. John was different.
“Oh.”
“Sherlock, do you want anything?”
She smiled as best she could. Mr Watson had been like an uncle to Sherlock, but she hadn’t seen much of him since war broke out.
“Shall I take these off?” John asked, tugging at Sherlock’s waistband.
“Shit.”
Mycroft chuckled, then exclaimed in pain.
“Sure.”
“So close... John- Mmmnngh! I- I- I’m gonna-“
Trenches.
“Sure, sure.”
“Ah!” Sherlock gasped, whole body convulsing.
“Mmmmmngh!” Sherlock cried, bolting up right as John’s tongue flicked one of his testicles.
Sherlock reached into his pocket, and pulled out a 20 pound note.
John was starting to panic, his heart surging, his stomach sinking.
He’s pressed right up against my entrance now, not inside, not quite, but fuck...
John jumped up from the sofa, and walked over to Sherlock, who seemed all too happy to pass the seemingly imperative metal container on to someone else. Sherlock watched over John’s shoulder as he eventually managed to open the tin.
“I can still hear you. You repeating ‘doesn’t Javier have better things to do?’ Over and over is kinda hard to ignore. Besides, you’re gonna wear a bloody rut in the floor boards.”
“Move in with you?”
P.S both John and Sherlock are now 16.
“Fuck... oh fuck... oh, oh, oh! Mngghhh! Gahhhhh!”
-Love Sherlock x.
“Agh!”
“Are you ok?”
Sherlock realised she shouldn’t have been so quick to suggest John, and should have jumped straight to denial.
“Oh, hello John. Is there a problem? Only
“His justification was that he did it for my own good; it was the only way to stop me...”
“Guys? Sherlock? Where are- fuck.”
“Fucked.” I pants as he leans against the wall to pull his trousers up.
Sherlock halted in his steps. This was just one of the names people had called him over the years. 'Freak, creep, nutcase, lunatic, basket case, looser, dork.' He bit back tears, and tried to put those memories at the back of his mind. He hadn't noticed the other two teenagers had gotten closer to him in his daze.
“Just relax.”
I’ve always been rather... quick on the draw...
“Do you want to take him?”
“Do you have...?”
“Do you want to maybe... take the next step?”
“Hello there, love. How are you holding up?” Mrs Watson asked, pressing a kiss to Sherlock’s cheek.
“So, What classes you got left?”
“You’re so beautiful.”
Sherlock flashed John a flirtatious smirk as he crawled up the bed.
“Hey.”
He buried his face in her neck, and let the tears flow freely. Sherlock put her hand on the back of his neck, and the other on his shoulder.
I watch from my bunk as the guards change shifts. CO Mary. She’s nice by other people’s standards. She talks to us like we’re people, which I suppose, is nice. She always vouches for me when I do certain things that land me in medical, at least. As I sit, I wonder where the blond guard is. I jump up from my bed, and wander out in to the common room. I patrol the prison till lunch time, then Mike all but strong arms me in to the dining hall. The guards have all switched over by the time we return to the dorms, and the blond is back in the bubble. I take sneaky glances of him as I tidy my side of the bunk. The fourth time I look up, he’s looking right back at me. I quickly advert my gaze. I feel my cheeks heating up, and a fuzzy feeling spread to my stomach. I shake my head in the comforting, albeit pointless motion of attempting to clear my thoughts. The clock on the adjacent wall reads 16:58. The showers are normally their quietest at either five am or pm, so I grab my wash stuff, and wander down the corridor. The pathetic dribble of lukewarm water isn’t exactly pleasant, but I’ll take it over the steady stream of freezing cold water in the other shower any day. When I walk out of the showers, I walk right in to something solid. That something turns out to be someone, and of course, it’s the blond guard. I step back, blinking wildly, my hands quickly reaching to hold the towel around my waist in place.
“You got any plans?” Rosie asked, turninh her head to Irene.
“Hey, you two wanna see a late night movie with the others later?”
17th of July 1917
John turned his head to catch Sherlock’s lips in a kiss. Said boy squeaked in surprise, they happily opened his mouth when John slipped his tongue passed his lips. He stepped in between John’s leg, rubbing his knee up against his groin.
She hesitantly walked over to her armchair, and sat down.
“These are her children, Harriet and John. Harriet is about your age, so perhaps you’d make friends.”
Well, this is just wonderful.
“This is your new bunkmate. James Thompson. Look after him.”
I notice the other inmates tense at my sides, a sheen of excitement sweeping the group as a potential standoff presents itself.
Sherlock gasped out a strangled moan as John sucked at her pulse point and leant her backwards on the bed. He pulled his briefs off before leaning in, pressing their lips back together, and trapping her between his arms that were situated either side of her head. He was settled between her legs, leaning on her pubic bone, her skirt hiked all the way up her hips. He moved one hand down her side, then up her thighs. She hummed happily in to his mouth, lifting her pelvis slightly to grind against his.
He’s certainly kissing me like he doesn’t care, desperate and hungry too as he claws at my back.
“Sorry. I didn’t mean to imply you had childish beliefs.”
She wanted to snuggle so deeply in to him that she could just disappear.
“She’s had quite a long labour, she’s probably just tired. She’s also quite young, so this is more traumatic for her. Try her again in the morning.”
“Yes, I am familiar with his work.” I murmur before I start tearing my face off, and shred it in to a million pieces.
John increased his pace, hips crashing together, tongues fighting, wet slapping sounds echoing, loud moans filling the room.
We sit for a moment whilst I trace patterns on his back and he breathes softly in to my ear.
“I’m gonna cum- ah- I’m gonna- oh Jesus fucking Christ- Sherlock!”
Sherlock knew he’d have to engage in small talk with her if he wanted to keep on her good side. She was rather useful, and an adequate partner.
Officer Mary is stood before me holding a pair of blue jeans, a navy jumper, and a pair of sneakers.
“You... you want me to...”
“What’s wrong? Oh.” Sherlock sighed when he saw the bottle.
SHERLOCK’S POV
“Do you understand, Sherlock?”
“Is there someone?” Mrs Watson asked upon noticing her son’s change in demeanour.
She held out a pair of mauve panties with attached garters. Sherlock was looking around the room, his cheeks flushed, his eyes the size of saucers.
Mycroft pursed her lips, but didn’t say anything.
John pressed a chaste kiss to Sherlock’s lips.
The woman... Adler... is stood in the door way, a playful smirk on her face.
Sherlock felt his heart lurch when John called him baby.
“Oh! Mmmngghh...” Sherlock groaned, bearing his teeth.
“I’m fine.” Sherlock snarked, turning in his seat when lestrade came over to sit with him.
“Do you want to hang out tomorrow?” John asked from where he was leant up against the gate.
“Dr! I’m gonna be sick!” Calls the man with the black eye.
Man, I’m gonna be bored at work without him.
“I was just going to get coffee. You look like you could benefit from some.”
“No.”
“Ready?” John asked, his voice thick and husky with arousal.
I engulf his hot flesh in to my mouth, all the way down my throat.
“Agh! Oh god!” The broad teenager moaned, sinking his nails into Sherlock’s pale skin.
They reconnected their lips, desperate for the others touch. John ran his hands down Sherlock’s chest, then paused, confusion plain on his face.
Sherlock looked up from his book and shook his head.
“Afternoon.”
John gets better at saying goodbye.
Should she get with Mycroft?
Sherlock looked at John, a mischievous look in his eye. He smirked, then sank to his knees.
“Well, I’ll be off then.”
“You ok?” John asked, reaching down to touch Sherlock’s cheek.
Sherlock forced himself to look away, his cheeks flushed red, and started walking towards the school doors.
He plunges his tongue down my throat, licks up between my top lip and my teeth, draws my tongue in to his mouth... fuck...
“We really should go.” John said as he looked down at Sherlock’s dozing figure.
“What are you doing?”
He turned around somewhat reluctantly.
We all but fall through the door as we pull at each other clothes without removing them, stealing each other’s air with suffocating one another.
“Would you like some tea, Miss Sherlock?” Lily asked.
“Someone hit you with a tennis racket?”
“Oh god...” He groaned with a thrust of his hips.
At 13, Sherlock was allowed out and about on her own for a short time, and longer if John went with her. John was nearly an adult, and had been allowed to take her down into London to the natural history museum for her birthday. John had never seen her so happy, running from display cabinets, dragging him along to look with her. The events of New Years had been dusted under the rug, and neither of them ever mentioned it. It was probably for the best.
Sherlock stopped in his tracks, and turned to regard his companion. Before he could come up with a response, an arrogant one no doubt, John grabbed him by his coat collar, and pulled him down into a kiss. Sherlock was surprised at first, but melted into it after a moment, his arms wrapping around John.
“It’s not your fault.” Sherlock murmured, pressing a kiss to john’s cheek.
“Mr Holmes!”
“Mmm...” Sherlock shivered.
I can’t believe I am actually losing my virginity, losing it to the man I love.
I wander back to my bunk, perhaps a book will suffice.
Sherlock frowned at this.
“Oh baby.”
John was almost directly above him now, providing him with a better angle. He locked his elbows in place before dropping his hips again.
“Just a hunch.”
“Any problems and I’ll bring him right back to you.” John assures her.
Sherlock age: 14
It’s so intense that I have to rely on his sturdy build to hold my weight up, my motor skills completely failing me.
“She’s alive, but you need to call an ambulance. Now, Mum!” John yelled, moving his sister to the floor, and putting her in the recovery position. Mrs Watson was hyperventilating, and appeared unresponsive.
27th of may 1918
Only went and posted this on the wrong story. AO3 was acting up. *eyeroll* anyway, hope you enjoy! Drama in the next chapter!
John leaves for war.
“And we destroyed your skirt.”
John shuddered and bit his lip. He cleared his thoughts after a moment, and turned his attention back to the beautiful girl beneath him, her dark hair spread about the covers, her cheeks flushed, lips bruised and full.
“So you’re demanding now, too are you?”
I’m soft and gentle with him, carefully stretching him, showering him with kisses when I push inside him, telling how much I love him as I thrust in to him.
Sherlock comes all over my hand with a loud cry.
“Ok, I don’t have any classical music, but I have a shit tonne of ‘Green day’.”
“See for yourself.”
She excepted johns hand, and allowed him to lead her over to the dance floor. The pianist began to play.
Sherlock sat with her while she ate, although most of it ended up going around her mouth rather than in it. She turned to look at Sherlock with a broad, chocolate covered grin. Sherlock felt her heart rench as she looked at the happy child. Oblivious. She’d give anything to be that shielded from the world once more. She hadn’t heard from John in four months. If she was oblivious, she wouldn’t have jumped to all the tragic conclusions on what had happened to him.
No!  “I’m fine.”  I could not relax.  I was being pole-axed.  Maybe I’m not as gay as I thought.
THE END
I list the familiar symptoms of hypoxemia and try to put a look of something other than complete and utter panic on my face.  The time I’ve spent attempting to face my fear, the weeks spent finding a place to go without being seen, the countermeasures taken has led to this place.  I can do this.  I will do this.
Of course I had intended on being his first.  At some point.  “Yes.”
“Don’t try to deduce anything, John.  I don’t want you to get a headache.”
“Yes.  Not all the time.  But, yes.”
“Yes, I’m aware that if Dr Mumford is aware of someone using his equipment, he will have a fit.”
“Take the light away for a moment and then do it again.”  After Sherlock did as he was instructed, John continued.  “The pupil in the right eye will obviously constrict but the left eye has to as well even though the light isn’t in that one.  It’s a sign of brain damage if they’re not equal to each other.”
“Yep, Vin Diesel is his name.  Swedish fella.”
“John, I need to be inside you when I come.  Is that okay?”
“Yes, John.  Of course.”  Of course, he knew the party line.  When anyone else had been the victim, he did know that.  Of course, he did.
Sherlock smiled appreciatively and reached for the newly exposed skin and muscle.  “Beautiful.”
“I’m not opposed to that.”
“And did you ever reach orgasm thinking of me?”
“Sorry, what?”  Sherlock sounded shocked.
I sighed.  “I suppose I do.  I guess I’ll continue my blissed-out, perfectly warm, post-coital nap then.”
Sherlock was fully sprawled across the exam table, face down. “She was walking through with a cup of the solution in her hands.  She tripped and knocked it over while I was standing at the centrifuge.  When I turned and came back to my seat at the microscope, I hadn’t realized she had spilled it all over my chair.”
“Then explain it to me,” John said patiently.
“Yes, Mycroft, brilliant deduction.  I had sex.”
Wisely, Sherlock backed off immediately.  He sat back on his haunches and looked up.  “So beautiful.  Look at you.  Completely debautched from armpit to ankles, cock leaking and wet wanting so desperately to be touched and needing so desperately for this to last.”
Mike was a bouncer at one of London’s premier nightclubs.  It was easy to sneak out of the flat at 3am on a weeknight to meet him at the club.  John wouldn’t even notice.  He’d wake up and go to work not even realizing that Sherlock wasn’t asleep in his room with the door closed.
Sherlock smiled.  “Thank you, John.  I’m ready.”
Sherlock laid flat once more and flipped onto his front side.  “Just so you know, I did enjoy that.”
Sherlock looked his fill and then flopped down next to John, manhandling him onto his chest.
John nodded and tilted his chin up for another kiss.  “Sorry.  Hurts like a bitch though.”
“Did that hurt you?”  John would chalk up Sherlock’s abrupt approach as inexperience, which he was but he was also running out of patience.  He needed John’s body to be his.  Now. He felt like the bubble would pop any moment and instead of being in bed with John, the he would start to see and feel … like he wasn’t actually here.  He needed to feel something real, something perfect, just once.
“I’m fine.”
“Pardon my ignorance, John, but this is hardly what I had pictured and I don’t know what you’re on about.”
“I know what you meant.  I’m sorry, I’m sorry.   I promise, I am a romantic fool usually and how could I not be when I’m so completely, madly and passionately in love with you.  I made you feel alone after such a huge milestone in our relationship.  For that I apologize.  Sincerely.”  He placed a kiss, soft and gentle on Sherlock’s forehead.  “I’m sorry Sherlock.  It won’t happen again.”
“It was the best vantage point.”
John moved to the sofa and without hesitation, sat down on the small space beside his friend, half turned to face him.
John nodded. Everything was definitely in order. "How did Mycroft know you injured your hand?"
“A few.  I’m going to do the usual, PSA and blood culture, but I also want hormone levels, testosterone, parathyroid …”
John shook his head.  The voice.  That beautiful, baritone voice.  He may as well be humming against his balls for all the effect just hearing it caused.  “Sherlock … please.  I can’t …”
Finally, John heard the shower turn off.  He thought he would give him some time to get dressed, put his ‘armor’ on.  It would probably make Sherlock much more comfortable to have clothes on for this conversation.  He waited for his friend to come out.  When several minutes went by, John walked down the hall and knocked.
Sherlock was relieved John didn’t hate him.  He had smiled, made flirty innuendos so he obviously had not done anything too … not good.  He wondered if John had orgasmed at all.  He didn’t remember.  He knew he hadn’t assisted John in that area but he knew it hadn’t lasted very long all together and he was rather selfish, especially in those last moments.  He supposed John could have come during the sex and then cleaned him up after he had flipped Sherlock over onto his back next to John.  John could have masturbated himself after Sherlock had fallen asleep.  He had no idea.  He was sorry that the only time he would ever have the opportunity to see John come he had passed right out directly after orgasm.  He wasn’t sure what the hell that meant but he was sure it was not a great technique.
John nodded and braced himself, arching his back to allow Sherlock better access.
“Do you want to stay here or go down to the surgery?”
Terribly.
Sherlock tightened his muscles.  “Actually …” Sherlock began stroking his own cock.
Sherlock laughed.
“I put on another pair of gloves and re-examined him.  He thanked me for being so careful with him.  As I was prodding against the gland, paying particular attention to the borders of it and the consistency, he starts moaning … moaning like he’s near orgasm.”
John couldn’t hold it together anymore and let his tears fall quietly.  Sherlock knew his friend would rather scream and beat something to oblivion rather than sit there and quietly take in this news.  He knew John would go to the ends of the earth to find justice for Sherlock and he knew that John knew he could do nothing of the sort while they were sitting in the tiny, sterile room for the reasons they were sitting there having this conversation instead of having it at Baker Street.  He wouldn’t burden Sherlock with the force of his rage at the moment.  So he waited and he eventually calmed himself enough to speak again.
John moved to the edge of his seat.  “Listen, Sherlock.  I know you don’t think you’re good enough for a relationship, that you don’t want to hurt someone by showing them what kind of suffering you are going through.  It’s a lot to take on.  But, I know you Sherlock.  I know you can get past this.  You have no idea what I faced when I was invalided from the army.  My life was meaningless but I was able to find hope, find someone to share my life with.”
“Not for that.”  John leaned over, not even losing complete contact with Sherlock in order to grab the tube.  He put some on his hand, warmed it up and then on Sherlock’s cock, stroking slowly.
John found the gland easily, checked for the size, shape and feel of it.  “I’m going to check your rectal wall.”
“So, you sought out a stranger to give you this more pleasant experience so you could reprogram your brain and then he ended up hurting you too.”
“Uh uh,” John said shaking his head.
John laughed outright.  “That’s perfect.  Absolutely bloody perfect.”
Sherlock shook his head, “mmm  mm, I think you covered the material rather … comprehensively.”  Sherlock grumbled sleepily and nuzzled into John’s shoulder, both of them messy and sated, falling asleep in each other’s arms.
John ran his tongue from arse crack, down across the space between entrance and bollocks and drew slow circles there with his tongue.  He knew Sherlock was getting close again.  His cock was very thick and nearly purple.  John continued his journey licking across Sherlock’s bollocks and down the length of his cock.  He heard a distinctly deep baritone moan and knew the man was riding precariously on the edge of orgasm.  John flattened his tongue and gave the sensitive tip of Sherlock’s cock one long, teasing lick and sat up again.
“Yes, definitely a sawback.”  Sherlock confirmed and Lestrade nodded in confirmation as well.
John gave a self-satisfied smirk and told the man his services would not be required after all before shutting the door in his face.
Moving was a delicate issue.  He could see the state of the sheets and felt a fresh flow of wetness below when he moved.  All thoughts of attempting to flee the scene were thwarted.  He did need to have that fixed lest John find out and that just would not do at all.  John would be home by 4:30.  He had approximately five hours to have this dealt with and still have time to get home, burn his clothes and assemble some sort of experiment in the kitchen John would believe he had been working on all day.  He would be sore but he was convinced he’d be able to hide that from John.   John wasn’t the most observant although he was getting better at that thanks to his own influence on him.
“Everything!  She poisoned me, John.  Please focus.”
Sherlock sighed.  “I suppose, I will solve cases and you will blog about it.”
Sherlock smiled.  “I know.  Me too.”  He lined up his cock to John’s entrance and pushed.  John tensed and attempted to push his knees back together.  “Shh … relax, John.”  Sherlock nudged John’s knees apart once again and pushed them up toward John’s chest, opening him further.
“A broach that her daughter gave her for Mother’s Day ten years ago.”
He did stop and turned toward me then.  “Data!  On me?”  He scrubbed a hand through his hair and blew out a frustrated breath.
He went to peel his own vest off but remembered his scars and didn’t.  He suddenly craved to be skin to skin with John then laid himself down on top of him.  Wanting more friction, he brought John’s knees up and around him by spreading his own between John’s legs.  The thin layer of pajamas was too much of a barrier and Sherlock raised himself up long enough to push them down past his knees then squirmed out of them.  Cock against naked cock was glorious.  So glorious.  The friction was amazing.  More, he needed more.  Raising himself up, he traveled down John’s body, pulling his tongue against John’s skin the entire way down to his cock where he put his nose right there at the crease of John’s groin and breathed in deeply.
“Nice distraction technique doctor.  Does this work with the general public as well?”
Sitting back on his haunches, he took in the full sight of John flushed and naked.  So beautiful.  So achingly gorgeous.  He placed the condom on his own cock and smeared his penis with the lube.  He placed some more at John’s entrance and then pushed a finger inside him.  John gasped and pulled away a bit.
Sherlock grabbed me before I could make it five feet away.  He wrapped his arms around me.  He feels nice, secure.  It feels good to be held by him.  “Hey.  It’s okay.”
“And now you’re tolerant of me touching you.”
“I am hard as hell John.  I think all my blood volume is locked inside my penis.  I need to come.”
John shook his head and smiled.  “No, I suppose not.”  John leaned forward a bit.  “I have another question.”
Sherlock dragged himself up a bit, leaning his torso against the arm of the sofa.  “You like to take care of me.”
“Oh God!”  Sherlock moaned burying his head into another pillow.
Sherlock huffed and sagged into the mattress, his hips still propped up.  “Fine.”
(See the end of the chapter for
But John was so warm and so perfect and he could touch him and John would touch him back and not flinch in disgust or demand acquiescence.  The anger and panic of earlier a forgotten feeling in the depth of the blissful quiet within John’s arms.  Why shouldn’t he accept what John was giving him?  He never thought he could ever feel this kind of comfort and security again.
“Ah!  Oh, that is fascinating.  It’s like a swirling fingerprint!”
Sherlock looked amazed at the site of the elongated tube being entirely doused with lubricant.  “Is that entire thing going inside of me?”
“Nothing!”
“Four years of undergraduate school, four years of medical school, six years in residency and then another seven years in practice.  All of that medical knowledge and the best you have are frozen vegetables?” Sherlock asked indignantly.
Sherlock sank back down flat in the bed.  “Obviously.”
Sherlock nodded lethargically.
I took a deep breath through my nose.  Something familiar.  Sort of gym locker room with a touch of fresh sex.  I briefly thought about my days in uni when I played rugby.  If we would have had more orgies in the locker room, I’m certain it would smell like this.  Looking through the crowd I’m certain I would hear the lust consume this room if my ears were not ringing.  I could see it though, flashing colored lights against flesh.  Lots of flesh.
“Lay back, please.”  Sherlock instructed and John complied quickly enough.  “I am going to gently pull up your gown, John.”
“I’ve got two stitches left and my gloves are sterile.  Can you hang on?”
“Hands on the headboard, please.”  John obeyed quickly.  “Don’t let go.”  Sherlock warned before his thrusts became more insistent.
Sherlock did and again the dual sensations were amazing.  His cock and tongue surrounded in the smell and taste of John.  Beautiful, warm, familiar John.
“Mmhmm,” John moved the blanket aside and placed the icepack himself before returning the cover.  “I’ll look at it again to make sure it’s not getting worse.”
Sherlock looked pointedly at John then smiled.
I turned around to look over my shoulder when he doesn’t immediately settle back inside me.
“Wait for it.”
He laughed before insinuating himself into my personal space, leaning into me, his hand on the back of my neck as he kissed me once more.
Sherlock looked up half interested.  “Who manipulated you?”
“You could have provided me with a sample, you know.  If I was bothering you that much.”
Not here.  Not this way.  As much as he is begging me to bend him over the bench in front of us and shove into him anonymously, I cannot.  I talk again, directly into his ear.  “Do you want to know my name.”
“Oh, well good thing I ran into you, Malcolm.  Thank you for saving face.  I would have been so embarrassed in front of Dr Rowandenshberg.”
“Yes, that’s it.  You can keep your socks on if you like.”
“I’m sorry.  Again, not romantic at all, I know.  I need gravity working with us, just long enough to get what I need.  I promise, I’ll get naked directly after.”
“When was the last time you used the loo?”  Sherlock enunciated clearly, if impatiently seemingly using all of his energy stores to get the question out.
Sherlock breathed rapidly, and was getting himself under control a bit, “I almost did.”
“There you go.”  He pushed himself inside me in one long, slow, gentle push.  “I’m inside you, John.”  He grinded his cock inside my ass as if I needed a better demonstration.  “Fucking amazing, John.”  His hands are all over me, holding me to him.  He doesn’t move, not yet.
“Oh, I’m not done with you yet.  It’s going to last.  Trust me.”  Sherlock rubbed the side of John’s cheek.  “I’ll go slow.  It’ll be easier if you’re on your belly.”
I nodded my head.  How do people breathe?  I’ve forgotten.
“Really?”  Again, Sherlock brought that perfect bottom lip up and caught it on his top teeth.
“Yes, you were right, you berk.  No peas.  We do have frozen carrots and broccoli though and that will do.”
“Yes, the pressure on your prostate from the ultrasound probe probably helped your symptoms temporarily.”  John watched the last of the fluid dribble out.  “Finished?”
“When did you go to the bathroom last?”
“Good, that’s very good.”  John shook his head, “you’re lucky. This coulda been much worse.”
“Fuck.”  I started to relax a bit.
“I love them.”
Sherlock slowed.  “No, don’t stop yourself, John.  Cry out, please.  It’s supposed to be sloppy and loud and vulgar.  Let it go.  I want to hear you.  Want to hear what I do to you.”
“Sherlock!”
He couldn’t las like this.  It was ridiculous.  Why was it not working?  The sex between himself and John had been real.  Visceral.  He could still feel John on his skin, his body around his.  It was a very strong memory.  Why couldn’t he simply copy and paste it where it needed to go?
“It’s okay.”  His hands caress my ass.  I feel two fingers run from my balls all the way up the crack of my ass.  He separates my cheeks.  He runs the side of his hand up and down the crack.  My ass is propped in the air.  I am completely vulnerable to him.
“I examined his prostate gland.”
“I’ve been poisoned.  You have to make it stop!  Now!”  With that, Sherlock dropped both trousers and pants and bent quickly over the side of the exam table exposing a frighteningly alarming looking rash to both cheeks.
“No.  The master key doesn’t fit Dr. Mumford’s exam room.  Here, I’ll let you in then.”
“I am here when you come home from work, I make an effort to be nice to you,” at John’s look the clearly conveyed ‘really?’ he continued, “well, I have stopped calling you an idiot.  Directly to you at any rate.”  Sherlock put his tea down.  “At any rate, my … issue, as you put it came up numerous times other than during medical reasons.  You didn’t notice.  You weren’t meant to so don’t fault yourself for that.  I, of course, would have noticed but few are as observant as I am.”
“Oh.  How ‘bout if I just lay on my stomach?”
“Yes, of course.  It produces a white, alkaline substance that consists of 50-75% of the male ejaculate.”
“What can I say?  They definitely are more supportive.”
“Mmm.”  Oh, trust me, I’m freaking relaxed.  A little twinge of pain when he pulled out but not bad.  I feel him separating my cheeks and looking at me.
“I bet you can.”  John allowed his mouth to be opened for the kiss.
“What if I’m in the mood when you’re in the middle of an experiment?”
“Oh, yes.  Of course.”  John was a bit shocked that Sherlock would want to go somewhere so vanilla as a bedroom for this, but, he was not averse at all.  Rising to his feet, he offered a hand to Sherlock and pulled him to his as well.
Sherlock was just drifting off when John returned with the frozen vegetables.  He grinned sleepily when the bags were clearly NOT peas.
Fortunately, urology was only on the third floor.  Finding their way from the stair well to the urology department would only be a matter of two turns.  The first they took very carefully, fully aware of noises that might indicate the security guard was, in fact, doing another walk-through of the building before end of shift.  How hard could it possibly be to hear a man in his late sixties with the gout, shuffling through the hallway?
His eyes squinted in thought
“What?  No, we haven’t.”
“Pardon?”  I crossed my arms in front of my chest knowing full well what my body language conveyed.  “I had no intentions of ever shagging you until … until…  You weren’t intending to trick me then?”
Sherlock rested his head against the window and sighed.  “Fine.”
Sherlock grasped John’s arm.  He wasn’t sure if it was to calm himself or get him to stay with him.  He knew he needed to do his counting and breathing exercises, get ahold of himself, but things were just so far down the tunnel.  It was difficult to come up with the right order of the numbers, to think or to breathe.
“John, I have no idea …”
Sherlock broke away from the kiss and locked eyes with John.  “No, not there.  Use your hands, both of them.  Feel my arms.  They’re taut, keeping myself above you without hurting you.  My shoulders locked to bear my weight.  Feel my back, down my spine, my buttocks, all yours, John.  Every muscle, every fiber yours and hungry with desire for you.  Feel your legs, bent and open, resting at my sides, ready to take me in.
“And you’re being dangerous.  Erase your profile on that dreadful site and text your brother or I will.”  John hung his head and rubbed the bridge of his nose and mumbled under his breath but Sherlock heard it anyway, “or go to fucking therapy and deal with it properly and forget all this bullshit.”
John manhandled the testicles, feeling each in turn, checking for nodules or irregularities.  “Have any pain when you tried?”
“No, it’s called Nightingale syndrome.  You appreciate how I’ve taken care of you.  I would be a cad if I took advantage of your vulnerable state.  I know your history with other medical professionals, I’ve made sure to treat you with care.  It’s made you feel things you don’t really feel.”
Sherlock sagged a bit, turned toward John and raised an eyebrow before entering the kitchen.  With a bit of effort he removed his jacket and sat upon the end of the table with an indignant “fine.”
John sighed.  “Stay right where you are.  I’ll go talk to her.”  John clambered up and off of Sherlock, pulled on his jumper to straighten it into something decent before he opened the bedroom door running right into Mrs. Hudson.  John could feel the blush spreading to his cheeks and the tips of his ears.  “Ah, hello, Mrs. Hudson.  We were … just … we ..um …”
John crossed his arms, saying nothing for a moment. Apparently Sherlock was going to be just as forthcoming with answers today as he was yesterday. Fine. "Yes," he moved toward Sherlock and pulled back the blanket. "I'll take off the dressing and you can shower. I need to check the stitches anyway." He pulled back the tape as gently as he could trying not to remove all of Sherlock's leg hair. He winced in sympathy as he felt it pull the hair out no matter how careful he tried to be. Finally he just ripped it off, better to get it over with. "Sorry."
“Mmmm…no.”
“Oh, Sherlock!  I’m … I’m coming!”  John’s breathing was rapid, shallow, he grasped Sherlock’s biceps tightly and rocked into the sensation.  His come spilled between them.
“You doin’ okay, Sherlock?”
Lestrade rolled his eyes.  “C’mon Sherlock,” he said pinching the bridge of his nose trying to muster as much patience as possible.  “Can we just assume we’re all idiots and have you move on from that point?”
“You do know she has a mad crush on you though, yeah?”
John placed his hands on either side of Sherlock’s head, not holding, just caressing, running his fingers through Sherlock’s hair.  Looking down, he saw Sherlock part that perfect mouth and place John’s cock inside.  He didn’t try to go all the way down or to even see how much he could fit.  He just placed the sensitive head right on his own tongue.  “Oh God!”  John hissed and trembled.
“Obviously.”
“I know.  I want you too.  The first time with a new partner is always a bit nerve racking, I suppose.”
“All of those things still happen.”
“What?  How so?”
John was a bit gobsmacked.
“I’m not asking your permission, Sherlock.”
“Of course you are,” John sighed.  “C’mon, up you get,” John pulled up from under Sherlock’s arms and the man cooperated and stood although a bit shakily.  “Whoa, there we go.  Let’s get you properly seated.”
“John, I am completely naked.  You don’t have to be a detective to answer that for yourself.”
“Not yet, love.  As soon as I’m inside, you can come.”
“You’ve never told me when your birthday is so how would I know?”
“This is an ultrasound of your bladder.  I can check for post-void residual.   It’s done just after …”
“Yes, please.”
“Exactly.  I do actually prefer it be you.  That is, if you don’t mind.  I know you, I trust you.  You’ve examined me before.”  He paced a few more steps back and forth keeping John in his peripheral vision. He thought back to the examination he had endured after Mycroft had taken him out of Serbia.  The elderly, German physician had been anything but gentle or reassuring.  Not that he needed coddling, of course, but the thought of someone so aloof and detached and condescending seeing him without clothing was contemptible.
“Oh.”  John pulled away disappointed.  “Oh!  Yes, sorry.  Turn over.  I’ll put some more cream on it.”
“I know.”
“It’s small.  Very small.”  Sherlock continued to probe the area, spread him open and pulled his cheeks apart.  “It’s so pink and wet.  Obviously abused.”  He pushed one single finger inside.  “Still tight, you recover very quickly.  Even this soon after I bet it would hurt quite a bit if I were to fuck you again.”
“At the cost of your sanity!”  John shook his head.
“Not nearly as boring as lock jaw.  C’mon, up you get,” John moved a raised finger around in the air in a circle signifying Sherlock should turn around and get on with it.
Finally he sat up, shifted forward and thrust two fingers inside me.  “Is that agreeable to you then?”
John sat on the edge of Sherlock’s bed.  Patiently, he waited for Sherlock to accept his presence.
“Did I do something wrong?”
“Typical.”
“Incorrect.  I’m telling you that before six months ago I hadn’t even achieved an erection in ten years.”
“Yes, John.  I know.  Are you alright?”
“So, I’m to understand that you, Doctor,”  He emphasized that word like it was foul.  “…not only completely flummoxed our first-time by your faulty prioritizing …”
“I’m not asking you to appreciate it.  It’s just a matter that has to be dealt with.”
“What?”
“No, no … I’m just … feeling.”
“Point 4—sexual attraction.”
John smiled back.  This man.  This incredible man.  “Would it surprise you to know that I would rather like to kiss you now?”
Well these are some short chapters.  Should have just combined them but, no biggie, I suppose.  It seemed so much longer when I was writing it.
“Not just during cases.  All the time.  Well, a lot.  It doesn’t have to be case-related.”
Sherlock turned to face John.  With no room between them, Sherlock kissed John’s nose and pulled back an inch or two.  “Are we supposed to rate each other at this point?  Is there a list of Likert scale questions or will just a 1-10 scale suffice?”
“For how long?”
After a thorough exam and washing, Sherlock was still itching furiously.
Sherlock shuddered, “yes that does sound like a long tedious day.”  Sherlock turned back toward his microscope.
“Mycroft,” Sherlock said beseechingly.  “Please don’t …”
“You’re quiet.”
“Well, upon fear of death to anyone else who touches me, but I suppose that’s probably as sappy as you get, right?”
Sherlock sighed and his feet began to twitch.
“I’m fine.”
“Then I won’t put that one behind your head.”
“Fine.  Just trying to help you.  If you need… more sexual partners, if that’s what you have to do, fine.  But you are NOT answering any Lonely Hearts ads and you’re not meeting anyone alone”
John pushed his chair closer and sat across from Sherlock.  “What slips away?”
“Feel alright?  Did I hurt you?”
John shifted his weight and cleared his throat which he always did when he was nervous.  “I know you are going through something right now and this is not the time.  No pressure, at all.  I’m not in a hurry.  I just wanted you to know that, when you’re ready, if you’re amenable, I would very much like to talk more about the possibility of … of us.”
“Okay.”  John stood up and tossed the nearby examination gown onto the table.  “I’m gonna step out.  Change into that and knock on the door when you’re ready.  I’ll give you several seconds to have a seat on the exam table when I hear you knock.”
“Don’t be silly.  I did no such thing.”
“I just don’t care anymore, Sherlock.  You win”
John held up his hand still trying to get the nasty taste of the tongue depressor out of his mouth.  He sighed, “why do you want to see something so mundane?  It can’t be a topic you run into during your work?”
John didn’t let Sherlock push attention back onto him instead of where it should be focused.  “Ingrained military fortitude and all that.”  He donned exam gloves. “Oh, before I forget.”  He grabbed a syringe with a long needle-nose tip.  “This is full of an anesthetic gel.  I’ll need to push this into your urethra to numb the area before I do the scope.  It takes a few moments to work so I’ll get that out of the way while we do the other.  It should take effect by the time I’m done.
“Hmmm … yes, but especially with you.”
“Pull your knees up toward your chest.  You don’t have to fold yourself in half, but some pressure to the abdomen would help.”  Once his patient obeyed, John liberally applied lubricant to the probe and to his patient’s anus.  He moved the lubricant around the sensitive tissue with his thumb, getting Sherlock ready to be penetrated in this manner.  “I need you to relax, Sherlock.  Take some deep breaths.  These muscles should not be tensed up during this exam.  It could be detrimental.  Relax and breathe a moment.”
“Oh, how many times do I have to explain this?  It’s all about the WORK, John.  You’ve seen my methods, sometimes I have to … employ certain distasteful practices.  Sometimes that includes flirting.  With women,” Sherlock clarified.
“That was, hands down, the funnest medical procedure I’ve ever had in my life.”  Sherlock blew out a loud breath.  “Well, the procedures themselves aside, I think, but the intrigue …”
Sherlock sighed.  John Watson never stopped surprising him.
I didn’t immediately see him as I entered our shared flat.  I looked into the kitchen.  Maybe he needed some tea to calm his nerves a bit.  Good idea.  He was not there either.  Probably in the bathroom then.  Best to give him time to settle himself.  He would come back when he was ready to talk.  I moved to my bedroom intending to change into my night clothes.  John was in my room.  On my bed.  Naked.
Sherlock debated sitting back on his haunches and watching his own fingers move inside of John’s body, preparing him.  If he moved back away from John, it would probably be more comfortable for John to keep himself in control and prevent him from coming.  If he did that, however, then he would miss those delicious and satisfying noises and he wanted those.  Every single one of them.  He wanted the feel of his breath on his cheek every time he pushed inside of John with his finger.  Oh, the breath that escaped his lover when he added a second finger was … ugh, god … so fucking gorgeous.  He wished he could keep every single breath that escaped John unbidden as he gasped and tried not to undulate beneath him.  He would lock each and every one of them up in their own box and open them one at a time, slowly, next to his ear to keep John next to him on the days John would have to leave his side.
“Yes, John.  So beautiful.”  Sherlock reveled in the fact that he had so thoroughly had John beneath him and had him undone.  Oh, the tightness was beautiful, even moreso while John was coming and clenching so tightly around him.  He could come undone himself if he allowed that.  No.  There was more to undo.  John was not as thoroughly debauched as he would like.  He had said he would make it last hadn’t he.
“Mmm … yeah I do.”  John said as he continued to stroke Sherlock.  He grinded his hips against the man below him.  He smiled.  “You liked it when I called you Mr. Holmes.”
“God, Sherlock, I could have helped … jeezus I, I don’t know.  I could have … I would have stopped pushing it on you.”
"Look, the nature of your injury is very close to ... well let's just say it might be a bit embarrasing when they start to examine you."
“Holy …”
“Hello.”
“Well, fuck.  I’m not pissed about it.”
“I’m sorry?”
“I’m not laughing.  Your body has been invaded by an instrument from someone meant to cause you harm.  I don’t find that humorous.  Lift up,” John instructed, bringing his patient’s trousers and pants down in one go.  He turned to Lestrade, “Grab me some tea towels in the drawer in the kitchen next to the fridge and my medical kit in the cabinet below.
His body stiffened for a moment, obviously having to beat out his instinct to lash out.  I held my breath hoping his own reasons for being here might overpower the soldier’s engrained response.  Finally, he relaxed marginally and grabbed hold of my arm, his head leaned into my touch.  He pushed himself back against me with his hips.  “You.”
“Oh, shut up!”  Sherlock stood and stormed into his room.
“Yes, please.”  John had pulled out a clean bed sheet and draped it over Sherlock, attempting to allow him as much privacy as he would allow any other patient.  “Warm enough?”
“Yes, I see that.  What were you doing … all crouching tiger in the corner there?”
“I know you went out at 2:43 this morning to meet one, Michael Samuel Broslin, age 32 at the nightclub, Blue Neon.”
“How much therapy or treatment do you think I’ve had since Serbia?”
John met his eyes.  “Oh, c’mon, you’ve had to have seen a bullet wound before.”
“The medicine … just the medicine,” John clarified with a grin of his own.
John looked to the young girl. "I think it's okay to let him go. I'll keep his spine safe. Promise."
Until John came around.
“Sherlock, this orifice,”  I pointed to my mouth “is not just for telling people what stupid, sodding gits they are.  It is for actual, useful communication as well, you arsehole.”
“What?”  John was confused.
“You’re welcome,” John said with a look of indifference as he waited for the scathing comments to follow.
Sherlock’s knees nearly gave out on him as his come splattered against John’s bed.  John held him up, letting him stroke himself to completion and then some.  Finally, John lowered him easily and manhandled him into the bed properly.  Sherlock was sound asleep, looking extremely pleased and satisfied.
“Alright, alright.  Point 3 is yours.”
“Yes, sometimes an excess of parathyroid hormone can cause an increase in PSA levels which I’m guessing are going to be somewhat elevated as well.”  He removed the needle after filling the last vial and placed a gauze in the crook of Sherlock’s elbow.
"I fell two feet. My legs are obviously working, I'm still breathing and I did not hit my head. Please let go of me and do stop helping your brother study for his medic license." He stopped when he noticed John in his line of sight. "Ah, my doctor is here. Doctor trumps you. John tell her to let go of my head!"
John bit his lip to keep from crying out as his ass was pummeled quickly, with abandon.
“We will soon see, won’t we.”
John began licking Sherlock’s entrance once more lightly stroked a couple of fingers down along the side of Sherlock’s cock before he brought his left hand back and gave a good slap to the same arse cheek leaving a lovely pink hand print in its wake.
John heated up the diaphragm of the stethoscope by breathing on it and holding it in the palm of his hand.  “Sorry if this is a bit cold.”  He moved it to several spots on Sherlock’s chest and back.  “Sounds great.  Very normal and regular.”
John nodded and got his equipment together to treat the wound.
“Oh, I can see that!”
John pulled down the scrub pants to just below Sherlock’s bottom.  “Ta.  I did  too.  Maybe, when you feel better…”  John was hopeful as he continued to rub the soothing medicine into Sherlock’s cheeks.
He woke with John on his bed, next to him, a hand on his shoulder, talking soothingly.  He started at John’s proximity at first.  John was always so careful to stay a safe distance away.
Ugh … gawd … I almost shot just there hearing him tell me he was going to put his cock in me.  Holy fuck!
“Certainly.  Why wouldn’t I be?”  He lifted John’s gown again and began pressing his fingertips into John’s abdomen just as John had done to him.
He smiled up at Sherlock.  “Kiss me.”
“That’s a gorgeous sound.  I want that sound in our bed all the time.”  John continued to kiss Sherlock and Sherlock pulled his hips up desperately wanting more contact.  “I’m going to get the lube.”
“That ever happen before?”  He could feel the organ in his hand fill and become more firm.  He ignored it as any physician would while he finished his exam.
"I'm a GP in Westminster, near Regent's Park."
Sherlock had changed into a grey t-shirt and was laying on his bed with a blanket over him pulled up to his chest.  “Is it as bruised as I think it is?”  John asked entering the room carrying a plastic bag full of ice and a towel.
John looked shocked.  “A transrectal ultrasound?  I don’t know why not.  It is standard procedure for your symptoms.”  After removing the probe from his abdomen, John carefully wiped the gel from his belly and pulled the sheet back up.  “You alright?”
“Sherlock,” John said in warning.  “C’mon, we’ve talked about this.”
“Well, I couldn’t just leave you like that.  I am a doctor.”
Sherlock was somewhat nervous about the evening.  There was a possibility that he would still not be able to handle someone else touching him.  He thought back to the Mordecai/Mylo incident.  Being with a stranger was claustrophobic and prickly.  Despite his predicament and how steadfast he was in his intention, he had not been able to actually go through with it.  Those feelings of disgust might come back again.  This time, he knew he had to press on no matter what.  He hoped Mycroft had figured out that he did not want a man that was bigger than him or was imposing-looking.  Someone with a nice disposition, a warm smile, gentle.
“God, you’re brilliant.”  John gasped.
“And if you’re in the throws of your thinking about a case, pacing, brooding and all that?”
“Wrong!  He was shot.  The bullet did not exit his body but you won’t find it during an autopsy of his body.  You’ll find it during an autopsy of that body,” Sherlock said pointing to a spot a few feet away from the corpse lying on the ground in the dirty alleyway.
“So, of course my deductions were based purely on what I had seen.”
“I’m not a urologist am I?  They don’t just allow me to commandeer their equipment whenever I like.  I did a rotation in urology.  I’ve done over a hundred cystoscopies.  I’m confident I can do it, but it’s not my specialty.  It’s either this or I have to refer you.”
Sherlock rolled his eyes.  “You weren’t there.”
Once they arrived back in the flat, knowing what was to come next, each of them attempted a mask of indifference and then just plain awkwardness.
“It did, it made me laugh.”  John took a deep breath and moved forward.  “Sherlock, look … if it’s the pain in your backside that you’re just embarrassed about, I get it.”
He was able to make it to the loo.  A bit stiff, but he made it without too much cause for concern.  His backside hurt, obviously and his head had a lump but no bleeding.  A massive headache but he didn’t feel like he was concussed.  His skin itched.  All he wanted was a good shower to rinse off the remnants of last night and forget about the entire thing.  He stared longingly at the shower.  To hell with Mycroft and his three bloody minutes.  He wasn’t concerned about preserving evidence.  He had no intention of filing this incident with The Yard.  The thought of giving his statement to Donovan or Lestrade made his stomach churn once more.  No, that was not happening.
“John.  Don’t be dense.”
“I … have it.”
Sherlock wrapped his legs around John as requested, hooking his ankles together.  He gasped when John stood with him still attached.
“It wasn’t his fault.  Just … just leave it.”
“Eight weeks.”
“Don’t tell me how inappropriate this is.  It isn’t.  It’s a perfectly natural progression.”
Sherlock slowly locked his gaze with John’s.  “I’m curious.”
“Ah?  That’s what you’ve got to say?”
“You’re being an arse,” John mumbled and then removed the object after he heard the digital beep and handed it back to Sherlock.
“Yes, of course.”
Mike, Frances and Albert were the only ones left.  Albert had to cancel their first meet because he forgot about his daughter’s dance recital.  Sherlock crossed him off the list as well.  Not that Sherlock was looking for a long-term relationship, but the last thing he wanted to talk about with someone was nappies and ex-wives.
“The rules are wrong, John.”
Sherlock winced not only at the prodding to such a sensitive area, but Mike/Mark, whatever his name was, had pushed down on Sherlock’s knees, bearing him more openly and crushing his legs to his own chest.  Breathing at all was a challenge.
“Yes, well, you don’t look like you’re Haitian or Dominican so, I figured nobody really knows a lot about people from Istanbul so …”
“No.”
Sherlock, still completely naked, sat up without regard for modesty.  He did list to one side however and then finally stood up when any pressure on his backside was not tolerated.  He took his medications and followed it with the cup of water John brought as well.
“She does not.”
“Seen and not observed, you mean.”
“But, you …”
“Glad you didn’t.”  John yawned.  “Want to talk?”
Licking a stripe of moist heat from the base of Sherlock’s cock to his tip, caused the writhing man beneath him to buck up off the bed wildly.  John placed his forearm across Sherlock’s hips to keep him grounded since he didn’t particularly feel like having the man’s cock shoved down the back of his throat.  Once he was secured to the bed properly, John took his cock inside his mouth letting it glide loosely in and out of his mouth, getting it wet, feeling it hit the roof of his mouth and sliding across his tongue.  Not wanting to let the use of his other hand go to waste, John began running his hands along Sherlock’s body, everywhere—his sensitive nipples, along his side, his inner thighs, down to his calves and back up to grab behind his knee and push Sherlock’s leg out and up toward his chest.
Mycroft tilted his head slightly and gave Sherlock a pitying look.  It made Sherlock want to scratch his eyes out.  “You’ll need medical attention.”
The man stood, stunned and blundered something vaguely apologetic and Mycroft rolled his eyes and dismissed them all from the room.
“Nope.”
“John?”
“Oh!”  Sherlock yelped.
John looked up at Sherlock, “I’m not giving in to you, you know.”
“If they do, then you’ll just have to massage me again.”
“John, you don’t …”
John rolled his eyes.  “Fine,” and he lifted his hips off the table as Sherlock dragged his boxers off and tossed them aside.
When he woke later in the afternoon, the flat was very quiet.  He took a moment to feel the sunlight and delight in the fact that he had actually took in several hours of much needed sleep.  He remembered waking up to nightmares though and then “Oh fuck!” His immediate thought was “what in the hell have I done?”  He remembered the look of pain on John’s face, the acquiescence to Sherlock’s need, John saying his name over and over.  Was he begging Sherlock to stop?  Did he hurt him?  He remembered feeling comfort and familiarity and warmth but was it actually mutual or did he guilt John into giving him this experience because he knew Sherlock needed it to reprogram his memories?  He flung himself out of bed.  He had to know if John was okay.
John huffed, “yeah, I suppose it could have been barbed wire instead.”
“No, your room.”
“Sherlock, great detective that you are, should probably be able to deduce weather or not I get a hard on especially since I’ll just be in my pants.  Not really much in the way of camouflage, is there?”
Sherlock shrugged, “I am gay.  Pretty sure Vin Diesel is required knowledge.”
John was sipping his morning tea when he finally heard Sherlock moving about in his room. He moved toward him quickly before Sherlock did something to knock his stitches loose.
“Again, with the romance.  Is this how you talk to your girlfriends?”  Sherlock huffed.
Sherlock scowled at the crime scene in disgust.  “Why have I been called in for this?”
“Sherlock?”  John sat up and attempted to shake the fog from his brain.  “What are you doing down there?”
“Yes, nice.  You feel so good, John.”  He pushed all the way inside.  “Is your cock getting enough friction where it is?”
He tried burning down the room in his mind palace, he tried to focus more on the work, keep the pervading thoughts at bay.  The “Mary” year had provided something of a distraction for a while--the wedding, working with John occasionally. Being shot was definitely distracting as was shooting Magnussen.  That had filled his head with so many nightmares…or maybe dreams, of shooting his many Serbian perpetrators just exactly so.  The satisfaction of seeing that in his head, the look of complete shock on their grimy faces, the loud pop, the give of tissue--blood and bone, the body slack and useless dropping to the ground, had been grand even if short-lived.  Soon the reality of what had and had not happened would take over once more.
“You didn’t tear.”
“Yes, I’m sure it’s very realistic to shrug off penetrative sex when you’ve been an enthusiastic participant in it since age sixteen.”  Sherlock brushed off John’s touch.  “It’s fine.”
“I thought you said we weren’t going to try antibiotics.”
John chuckled.  “I meant your bollocks, Sherlock.  Did the solution creep up any further … under,” John finished with a cupping motion of his hand.
Once the vehicle was moving, Sherlock looked directly at John but asked, "Maggie, how is the bleeding? Perhaps you should move the bandage and have a look."
“I could do all of that,” Sherlock announced.
It was several minutes later that he received a return text.
Sherlock scoffed.
John put his hand on top of Sherlock’s to still his efforts.  “Just have a seat for a second, all right?” John motioned for the other chair in the room instead of the exam table.
“Is that what you want?”
John sighed, regaining his composure as well.  He placed a hand upon Sherlock’s knee.  It felt comfortable there.  Just a friendly gesture he told himself, until Sherlock looked at the hand, then back at John and … something.  He couldn’t place that look.  It wasn’t recognition of friendship, that lazy smile and a nod.  No.  Fear?  No, not Sherlock.  Afraid of what?  John removed the hand easily.  “Ha, I almost said ‘my pleasure’, but that would be completely inappropriate.”
“You’re tensing up again.”
Mycroft jutted out his chin.  “No.  Not at the moment.”
Sherlock shrugged.  “Possibly,” he thought for a moment, “probably.”
John acknowledged the fierce protectiveness he felt toward the man with his head in his lap.  He supposed he felt it from day one and had proved it with that bloody awful cabbie.  John sighed.  It was more than that though, he thought to himself.  Much more than simple protectiveness.
John growled again and nibbled at Sherlock’s neck making the man squirm and giggle which made John laugh in return.  “God, you’re gorgeous.  I love it when you’re happy.”  John walked as he held Sherlock close, kissing and nipping at him, Sherlock thrusting his cock up against John’s belly, his arms and legs wrapped around him tightly.  When John came to the bed, he lowered Sherlock down upon it, but Sherlock refused to break his hold.  They lay against each other, thrusting their hips together, kissing and breathing in each other’s heady smells of sweat and lust.
Soon I was shirtless and kissed to within an inch of my life.  My lips swollen with want, my hips grinding into him as much as he grinded his hips into me.  There was something I should say, there was something that needed to be said.  He kissed me some more and all thought escaped my brain.  My trousers and pants were pulled down and away, my cock stroked to full hardness by his warm hand.
“I don’t read minds, John.  You know that very well.”
He laughed.  He added more lube, placed the blunt tip of his cock at my opening again and pushed forward.  I know what to do now.  It hurt.  It hurts like a sonovabitch but I relaxed and let him in.
“Mmm … John?  Can I please, continue?”  Sherlock asked.
THE END
“I’m demisexual.”
John turned to the fridge and opened a small compartment in the door.  “What you and your right hand get up to late at night is not my problem.”
“FUCK!”  I was not prepared for that.  I don’t know why I wasn’t prepared.  I am a doctor with full knowledge of the prostate and what its function is but I was not expecting it to feel like that.  My lips are numb.  Oh, ….
“Wait,” Sherlock stopped John from walking away.  “I … I appreciate the offer.  I’ll strip off in my room.  Give me a few moments first?”
"He didn't deliver the medication. Anthea injected it. Mycroft ordered her to do it. Obviously." He dug a piece of paper that looked an awful lot like a vaccination record out of his pocket and handed it over to John.
“Well, on you go then.  It’s yours.  I assume you have lube and condoms.  If not, I’ll need to get some out of my pants pocket.”
John wasn’t sure he liked the thought of Sherlock comparing his rising testicle to a fingerprint, but that was probably an apt description.  Much bigger scale though, thank you very much.
“John, I can achieve an erection,” Sherlock said rolling his eyes.  “I’ve just never felt the desire to share myself in that way.  I don’t even know if that is how I feel.  I just know that I think very fondly of it when you touch my arm or reach for my wrist or brush up against me and that I am amenable to being around you and I become irritated when you leave and when I’m injured the pang of need is … palpable.”
"There is very little Mycroft doesn't know."
“I mean,”  John bent down to remove his lover’s shoes, socks, trousers and pants.  “that you are not curious for the sake of ‘The Work’.  You are just curious.”
“Frequency, urgency, diminished urine stream and painful … painful everything.”
"John, I ... I,"
“You intended on being my first then, right?”  John impatiently explained.
Getting inside the surgery was easy enough since John had the key.  They had to sneak passed the security station but then they noted that nobody was sitting there at all.
“Oi!  I’ll be in the hall.”  John grabbed the doorknob.  “One other thing.”
“No, not from … I’ve been … in this position before.”
Sherlock continued to stare into the microscope.  “No, there’s no problem.”
“Boys?  Are you upstairs?”  Mrs Hudson bellowed.
“M’busy”
He stood up at the side of the bed and pulled Sherlock’s feet out of the pants.  Once he discarded them he grabbed both of Sherlock’s ankles and gently pulled them apart, placing both on his shoulders once more.  “Beautiful.”  John took in the sight before him.
Sherlock rolled his eyes.  “It stands to reason that if he could do it, I most certainly could.”
Sherlock smiled.  “Then I’ve deleted it.  You’re the only one I’ve ever wanted to look at me like that.”
“I know.  Just concentrate.  Feel me inside of you.  Stroking you, inside and out.”  Sherlock grabbed the sensitive cock of his lover and began stroking as he began thrusting inside as well.  “Don’t think.  Just feel us, John.  It’s amazing.  I have to feel you come again.  I have to spend time inside you.  Get to know you inside like this.”
Realizing he’d only gotten as far as taking off his button-down shirt in the last several minutes, Sherlock decided to stop thinking about Mycroft and about Milo/Mario as well.  He would file what he needed to file later. John would start thinking Sherlock had changed his mind after all if he took any more time.
“I did not know that.”
Malcolm smiled beamingly.  “Well, your secret is safe with me doc.  I have no problem getting’ one over on that pain in the arse anyway.  Demostrate away.  I will warn you, he usually comes in a bit earlier than everyone else.  Should be here in about an hour, maybe an hour and a half.”  Malcolm leaned in closer to John and dropped his voice to a whisper. “Probably likes to rub up and down on his equipment, have a little bit of private time with it, if you know what I mean?”
“Sorry.”  Sherlock looked apologetic and steeled himself, locking into a course of events to make himself into who he needed to be.  He lifted his hand, unsure but settled, and placed it firmly on M’s chest once more.  It kind of felt like he was grabbing a breast but then Mikah/Marcus flexed and he was pretty sure women’s breasts didn’t do that.  “Oh, that’s … uh … good.”
“Did you let him know that you’d changed your mind?”
Sherlock laughed.
“Fine, fine, but just … can you stop …”
John laughed and settled himself lying flat on his stomach between Sherlock’s legs.  “Hold yourself open for me,” John instructed as he pushed Sherlock’s legs from behind his knees up toward his chest.  Sherlock hooked his legs over his own arms and pulled upward.  “There you go.  Fucking beautiful,” he muttered before engulfing Sherlock’s cock with his mouth and sucking on every upstroke and laving the tip of Sherlock’s cock with his tongue on every down stroke.  He was aware Sherlock had yelped and started writhing with much more enthusiasm but his hips remained on the bed which John was grateful for because his hands were busy seeking that special spot once more that he knew would send Sherlock to the moon and back.
Sherlock grabbed his sheet quickly and made a hasty retreat to the bathroom.
"That was your doing. I'm pretty sure that was the reason Mycroft left though."
“Sherlock, we can get another doctor if you’d rather.  I mean it, I won’t take offense if you’d want someone you didn’t know.  Strangers bring a sort of anonymity which might be easier.  I’d still be able to be in the room if you would want me for support.   I can ask your brother to find another male physician or a female, whichever you prefer.  I’m here because Mycroft sent for me, but I don’t have …”
“Have never done this before?”
John laughed and bent down sliding his tongue between the firm, rounded buttocks.  He slapped one cheek causing Sherlock to yelp in surprise and look back at John.
“Sherlock, I’m going to come.  I don’t think I can …”
John nodded.  “I think she’s tougher than that, but you’re right.  She adores you and it would be hard on her.”
Sherlock’s eyes brightened.  “What did you have in mind?”
“I need us to come, John.”
He was aesthetically pleasing, but there was no chemical reaction in his brain to make Sherlock feel the necessary physical response one needed to make this more pleasurable.  Sherlock’s date rid himself of his jacket and his shirt quickly then turned to Sherlock and wrapped his arms around his waist.
John smiled in satisfaction as the person who made that happen but he was still a doctor.  “It’s the effects of the prostate massage.  I’m afraid that might be temporary so don’t be surprised if your symptoms return gradually.”
“Guess that doesn’t really save your modesty does it.”
Once everything was cleaned enough to pass inspection, John came over with a phlebotomists tray and pulled at Sherlock’s cuffs, getting them out of his way.  “Sorry, but I need a blood sample as well.  We’ll stop by Bart’s and drop it off at their lab on the way home.  Theirs is open twenty-four hours, even on Saturdays.  The lab here doesn’t open until nine.”
John sighed and asked, “did you want to have sex with your … um, date? Last night?”
I hiss as a finger made its way inside me.  It felt foreign, not pain, just not right.
Sherlock interrupted him before he was done explaining his point-of-view.  “I’ve been through this before.  The tests, they’re archaic at best and that’s if the physician isn’t a complete dolt.  They are nothing short of hell if he is.  I’m not going to some barbarian or someone I cannot trust and since you’re the only one that I do trust … ”  He left the end of the sentence unspoken but clearly understood.
John stopped what he was doing to take in what was happening with Sherlock.  Was he going into shock?  It was common to go into a kind of shock after coming down from a quick adrenaline rush.  John pulled a glove off with a snap and placed two fingers at Sherlock’s carotid artery.  “What’s going on, Sherlock? Are you in pain? Do you have another injury?”  John began pulling at Sherlock’s shirt to attempt to ascertain why the man’s pulse rate was going up instead of down.
“John, I did no such thing.  She doesn’t even know I had a reaction to it.  I helped her clean it up and she left the room all … flummoxed like she usually does.  I felt the skin on my buttocks become very hot.  I went into the bathroom and cleaned it off.  When that didn’t help, I came directly here.”
“But now, suddenly, you’re worried about how satisfied I am with how things are between us?”
John nodded, “Good.  How’s your bum?”
“John, you didn’t know.”
“Mrs. Slitheen lost another piece of jewelry,” explained John.  Mrs. Slitheen was on their frequent flyer list for lost items, lost earrings, lost dog, missing son, etc.  She had zero faith in the police and when Sherlock had made himself known to her by finding her precious Isabell, the Corgi, several years ago, she called upon Sherlock for every minute mystery in her life.  She was pleasant enough.  A bit spoiled by her life of wealth and privilege but she was harmless and respectful of Sherlock and his “sidekick”.
John turned his head to the side after a brief brush of lips.  “Sherlock … ugh …”  John squeezed his eyes closed once again.  “Sherlock … you can’t … don’t touch me at all except to … I’m sorry, but if you want inside me before I come, you can’t … you can’t touch me, or talk … please, just … oh god, please Sherlock.”  John’s body was a bundle of tense muscles.  It took all he had to not thrust upward, his body begging for the friction he knew hovered inches above him.  His arms flailed to his sides not wanting to take in the muscled arms of his lover, the smooth expanses of skin that would send him so easily over the edge.
“No.  No, I wouldn’t say that.”
While Maggie was busy yammering on about fever and risk for sepsis, John rolled his eyes and removed the blanket. Sherlock motioned toward his trousers with a flourish in an obvious effort to prove his point to John.
Sherlock set his two samples on top of a paper towel on the countertop.  He looked forlornly at the exam table all set up and waiting for him to lay upon it.
John rolled his eyes.  “No, the best is paracetamol but you can’t keep that down at the moment.  The best way around throwing it up is to give it IV, but there is a shortage of paracetamol IV.  It’s being rationed out to critical units in hospital only.  I have suppositories in my kit.”
“God, Sherlock.  So vulgar.”
“I fail to see how this has …”
“Yes, of course they do, but how much of it did you stop?  Not just in Serbia but wherever else you went while you were away, the countless cases before you left and the ones since you’ve been back.”  John stood and turned facing Sherlock.  “You saved my life Sherlock.  You are a hero a million times over and I know that because I’m here.  Because I’m standing right here and I shouldn’t be,” he cleared his throat and shifted his weight. “I should have been dead, could have been dead so many times, but you saved me Sherlock.  So, no, I wouldn’t dare compare my story to yours.”  John looked away and then back again at Sherlock, his best friend.  “I wouldn’t compare us because you, Sherlock, are much more brave and a much better man than I am, by far.”
“Opportune?” Mark, or was it Mike (Sherlock didn’t know or care) “Don’t be daft.  You’re just nervous.  You said you hadn’t done this in a while. Take a deep breath and stop thinking so much.”  Sherlock bucked his hips to dislodge the guy but that obviously just made the bigger man angry.  Sherlock was manhandled onto his stomach in a moment and completely pinned to the mattress.
He heard his door open, a splinter of light coming through and then the rustle of John leaning on the door frame.
John kissed Sherlock’s right arse cheek.  “Uh uh, one more.  Then I’ll make you come.  I promise it will be the best orgasm of your life.”
John nodded his head.  “Well it sounds like textbook case of prostatitis.  I’m going to schedule you for a cystoscopy and prostate exam tomorrow.  Dr Halliard is a colleague of mine at the …”
"John and I live together," Sherlock helpfully explained.
John chuckled and returned to his tea.
“Wipe your mouth,” John instructed then helped Sherlock stand.  “Did you get any on your pyjamas?”  At Sherlock’s negative response, John put a hand on the small of Sherlock’s back and led him out of the bathroom.  “Let’s get you back to bed.  You feel like you may have a fever.”
“No, no.  Local is fine.  Has this been used with this procedure for a long time.”
"It does matter and we're in the perfect place. Tell me why that didn't count."
"Didn't you text him?"
John was drawing up some medicine in a syringe.  “So you knew going down that way you were heading straight at the killer and you kept on walking without saying a word, not one word to one of us.  It wouldn’t have even taken a bloody phone call or a text, Sherlock.  All you had to do was nudge one of us and say ‘oh hey, by the way, that’s your killer standin’ right over there.  Would you mind being a good chap and arresting the bloke.’ But NO, Sherlock bloody Holmes and his massive intellect couldn’t be bothered.”  In his anger, John grabbed Sherlock’s hand and twisted into position for the lidocaine injection but stopped when Sherlock hissed and pulled back.
Sherlock moved down and licked John’s cock root to tip.  It tasted divine.  He didn’t have any desire to pull it all the way into his mouth, but he did like to smell it and taste it and touch it.  He moved lower, his hands rolling John’s testicles, feeling the wavy skin, the feeling of his clean hair there and around the base of his cock.  It was heavenly.  He lifted John’s leg up and wider to expose him further.  He just couldn’t get enough of that clean, warm smell, the taste.  The thought of “mine” came to him unbidden.  John would have been his already if it hadn’t been for … well for way too many things conspiring against them in the universe.  This was a cosmically bad idea.  But John was writhing and willing beneath him and he had to have him.  Just once.  He had to know what being engulfed by this warmth truly felt like.  Just this once.  Just tonight.  No past, no labels, no identity crises, just them.  Two friends consoling each other on a difficult night.
John continued working on the sutures.  “I mean that most people identify sexually somehow and sex plays a somewhat prominent role in their lives.  Some more than others but you haven’t really expressed yourself in that way, at least that I’ve noticed.  I had come to the conclusion that you were asexual, which is, of course fine, but that thought had changed when you … during your physical.  I had then concluded that you must have a medical kink and that at some point you must have explored that with someone, which, again, is fine.  I had been around you for months at that point and was not under the impression you had any … of those, types of feelings for me.  Why would I?  I assumed you just had this particular kink and I just happened to be there to witness it because if it was me, the physical exam, causing it, surely I would have noticed you acting differently around the flat and you, being you would have certainly let on about something like that.”
“Why wouldn’t Dr Mumfor do the demonstration?”
“That is your prostate, Sherlock.”
“This … patient of mine.  Sodding git!”  John took his tea and the newspaper and went into the lounge to relax in his chair.
“I am not surprised.”  John reached between them and unbuttoned Sherlock’s shirt spreading it open.  “God, just look at you,” John’s breath hitched before he took one of Sherlock’s nipples in his mouth and sucked.
I catch a glipse of us in the long mirror secured to his door angled just right that I can see us in it from across the room.  I don’t think I’ve ever looked so thoroughly open and debautched.  The look of him … eyes so hooded in pleasure even though I’ve been trying his patience.  The look of us, moving together.  Ah … god, so intense.  So fantastically intense.  Any doubt I might have was drown out by complete and utter desire to have him.  For him to have me.
She nodded quickly and bolted from the room, closing the door with a bit more force than needed.
“Uh huh,” Sherlock rolled his eyes.
Sherlock sighed and rolled up onto his side once more, nuzzling into John’s ribs.
“Yes.  Well sometimes we do scopes under general or light sedation, but I’m going to need you to walk out of here with me in about forty-five minutes, so, just the local.  Do you feel like you need something more?”
John looked briefly surprised but shook it off just as quickly and nodded without scolding Sherlock even though he very much looked like he wanted to.  Again, probably for the benefit of not making Sherlock feel weakened in front of Mycroft.
Sherlock nodded shortly and returned to the exact same position he was in before he picked up his coat, patting the well-developed pectoral muscles once more.  “I believe this is where we started.”
“Right, and what happened?”  John asked as he gathered equipment to wash the ‘poison’ off of Sherlock’s behind.
Of course, Maggie got out her stethoscope and opened Sherlock's shirt, placing the diaghragm of the instrument here and there on his chest. Then she tugged at more buttons and pulled the material apart completely, searching Sherlock's torso for injury, adding sticky electrode pads to his chest and hooking him up to the cardiac monitor.
“Except when it’s your own, I suppose.”
The green-eyed bartender finally noticed me and gave me a smile and a wink.  My mouth went dry and I had no idea what the hell I was going to order.  His smile got wider.  I wish to hell I could hear what he just said.  He put up one finger to tell me to wait one second.  I’m sure he is a mind reader when he came back with a bottle of whiskey and poured me a shot and stood there with the bottle.  I slammed the first one down in one go and he filled it right back up again.  He filled up a tall glass with ice and poured water into it with his little bar gun.  I’m taking the next shot slow.  He stood in front of me with a lopsided grin and winked again.  God was he hot.  Was he coming on to me?  Does he want me to go home with him tonight?  Does it really work this fast?  Is the leather jacket really that hot?  When he rubbed his thumb and forefinger together I feel myself turning six different shades of red and I realized I hadn’t paid the man for the drinks.  I slapped a twenty pound note on the bar and slink off with my tail between my legs.  So much for that dignity thing I was talking about.
“Yes, the ring that was missing.  It was red and ridiculously garish.  You did see him.  I’m probably feeding into the stereotype but it wasn’t a difficult leap to assume the disheveld, tattoed, pierced, hadn’t-eaten-a-proper-meal-or-bathed in a week, drug-dealer had never been to university himself so the ring was a bit out of place on him.”
“Well, this will be decidedly more personal than our usual, scrapes and concussions.  Plus, you would have called me the moment you could if you really wanted me to help you.”  John stopped and shook his head.  “That’s not to say you should feel guilty that you didn’t call.  Not that I would expect …”
John awoke with the sun barreling in through the windows and his body sprawled out lengthwise on the sofa.  He took a moment to remember why he had fallen asleep in the lounge, then raised his head eagerly searching for his flatmate.
I cocked an eyebrow and ambled up to the bar with attitude.  I’m determined to complete my mission with some semblance of dignity.  I will not come off like some 35 year-old pathetic virgin.  I am confident, I’m a fucking doctor.  I know my way around the human anatomy for god’s sakes.  How hard could it possibly be to get laid on a Saturday fucking night in fucking London?  I looked around at the 18-25 year old populace of the dance floor—most shirtless with hard-body pecs and tight abs—grinding against each other like they were starting the foreplay early.  I shake my head in misery.  I wore a tight, grey t-shirt, tight jeans and a leather jacket.  I thought I looked pretty good. I mean, I don’t think I’m the best-looking lad in the bunch but I’m not exactly hard to look at either.  But among the crotchless chaps, cut-off shorts, leather vests and the absence of clothing altogether, I felt like Uncle Pervie doing stake-out at the local playground.
When he was filing memories in his mind palace that night, he remembered that he had admitted out loud that he was, in fact, gay.  He’d never done that before.  He never thought he would.  Of course, Mycroft knew.  He’s always known but they’d never talked about it.  Why should they?  They never talked about personal matters.  John was someone that he had thought about telling.  In a previous life.  He had thought about it, fantasized, dreamed of taking their relationship to a different level.  He took a few moments to mourn the loss of what was supposed to be once more.
Sherlock shrugged.  “You prolong my orgasms anyway, I don’t see the difference.”
“Do you know what you’re looking for when you do that?” John asked.
Sherlock looked up, stunned.  “Is this something one does during ‘pillow talk’?”
“Ugh … God, Sherlock.”
“Of course, I’m alright.”  It’s Sherlock, for God’s sake, pull yourself together.  “Just stating the obvious.”
He sat as far from me as possible, staring out the window.
“Sherlock, I won’t last two more seconds if you had your hand on my cock.  Trust me, I’ll come anyway.”
John took in the scene quickly. "What happened?" as he knelt down in front of his freind lying flat on the ground with a bloody towel wrapped around his thigh. 'Well, someone knows first aid' he thought as he took in the young, female, apparently new, constable who was holding Sherlock's head tightly telling him he should remain still after such a fall because of possible spinal injury.
Sherlock startled.  “Yeah, just … sleepy.”
“No.”
“It seems highly inappropriate to kiss you as your doctor, but completely out of the question to not kiss you considering.”
After giving Sherlock a moment to get out of his head space about what had happened to him during his previous illness, John pressed on.  “I’m going to take hold of your penis, pull down the foreskin and you’ll feel a slight pressure as I push this gel into your penis.  It might burn slightly.  Then the area will become numb after a few moments.”  He held up the syringe again.  “There is no needle on this syringe, it doesn’t poke you, it’s just shaped this way for this purpose.  Alright?”
John nodded and moved back to where he was previously positioned, underneath Sherlock, on his back, legs spread wide and wrapped around Sherlock’s back.  Sherlock laid down on top of John and pushed his hands underneath the warm and tender man to grasp at his arse.  He held one cheek in each hand and pulled him up into Sherlock’s groin.  He moaned at the friction.  Sherlock kissed his friend while John moaned into this mouth as well.  The point-counter-point between sandwiching John between Sherlock’s body and his hands was … there were no words.  It was astounding.  The warm friction on his tongue and on his cock felt incredible.  It was amazing.  Familiar and not at the same time.  He felt John’s glorious hands running through his hair, along his jaw, his arms.  He was talking, that silky voice saying such lovely things, calling Sherlock beautiful and brilliant and so many other words.  It was nice, soothing and brilliant.  That was John.  His John.  So fucking brilliant!
John nodded.  Fair point.  “Have you ever been in a relationship?”
“So you’re definitely … last night had nothing to do with being attracted to me?”
Okay, folks--it's a bum story and it's a medical story so yeah, I went there.  Nothing graphic or even gross, promise.  Mostly, this is just lots more sleepy, pyjama clad Sherlock and comforting John.
“Considering she didn’t have a dog, no.  No, she did not.  I concede point 2 then, moving on.”
John gave his flatmate a tight-lipped smile.
“Seriously?”  Donovan interjected.  “You just made that up.”
John stood quickly when he noticed it was Sherlock that Sylvia had been shouting at.  He bustled in with his coat billowing behind him, a look of terror on his face.
John rubbed at his side protecting his ribs from further blows.  “You’re right.  Let me make it up to you.”
John told himself he wasn’t going to fall for it.  He absolutely was NOT going into the kitchen.
John rolled his eyes.  He was sure Sherlock was laying it on a bit thick but he wanted to see to his friend anyway.  In the year he’d known the man, John seemed to be the only person Sherlock permitted to touch him or show him any affection.  That was an assumption on John’s part.  There were days Sherlock would be gone for hours and John had no idea where he was or what he was up to but there were no outward signs that Sherlock was seeing anyone romantically and John thought, hoped, that Sherlock would tell him if that were the case.
“Yes, of course I am,” John rose and went to Sherlock quickly.  “Do you still have a fever?”  He placed a hand on Sherlock’s forehead.
“Thank you, John.  I thought I’d be apologizing to you for not dragging him to A&E like I should’ve done.”
“John, … I can’t do that again.”
“John, listen to me.  Focus.”   His hand found my softening cock and began stroking slowly.  I heard a distant, soft voice behind me.  “Breathe John.  Right now, breathe.”
This wasn’t anyone else thought, was it?
Sherlock nodded.
“That’s done then.”  He discarded his equipment on the nearby table and then placed a hand on Sherlock’s hip.  “C’mon, over you go.  Not much time left”
“So deep, so open … oh …. Oh … Sherlock!  Oh, God!”  John panted pushing against the headboard not allowing the pounding thrusts to be negated by the give of his hips against the force of it.  He couldn’t arch his back enough, he couldn’t press hard enough against the headboard and he couldn’t get close enough to Sherlock.  It was all too much, but not enough.  The pounding continued, oh, blessedly continued, his arse so open and willingly taking each thrust.
"Good God, get that smile off of your face. It is way too loud." Sherlock tried to move out of bed but it seemed as though his limbs were not working properly. "I'm completely naked. Why in the hell am I naked?"
“John, a rapist is off the streets.  You did the right thing.”
“What are you talking about?  I’m not bothered, Sherlock.”
“Is this standard?”
“Not since 2005.  Up.  Now.” He had already checked with Mycroft on that fact and had the vial in the refrigerator waiting for an incident like this to happen.  Given the lifestyle Sherlock lead, it was bound to happen.
Smirking, John chuckled.  “Yeah, what other good lookin’ blokes d’ya know then?”
“Come in, Sherlock.  Have a seat.”  John ushered him foreword to sit on the side of John’s bed.  “Nothing big to start with, I’m just going to listen to your heart and your lungs.  Open your dressing gown and let it fall to your lap, please.”
Hours later John finally heard the music from Sherlock’s room stop followed shortly thereafter by the man himself striding steadfastly down the hall in full dress.  He stopped for a second to grab his coat.
“Mike!”
“I bet that was overwhelming.”
“Pick another way.”
“About an hour.”
“Right.  Well I’m pleased to say that you are not retaining urine in your bladder.  That is good news.  It just means that since your prostate sits directly below the bladder, it becomes irritated with any fluid at all in your bladder.  The pressure increases and you feel the need to void all the time.”
“Alright.  Budge over then.”
Sherlock thought for a moment.  “Mrs Slitheen doesn’t have any other overnight staff at her estate.”
Dr. Humphrey nodded approvingly. "It's a bit irregular, but," he snapped his gloves off, "all right. I have another trauma coming in any minute and it doesn't look like he'll notice the difference," he motioned toward Sherlock.
“A bit.  I was excited.”
“John?”
“Sherlock?”  John said, more alarmed.
“You okay?”
Sherlock smiled.  “No, Doctor.  Not at all.  Felt wonderful.”
Sherlock buried his face into his arms.  “I … practice on her,” he admitted.
“You,” Sherlock said as if that explained his thoughts.
“None that have the movement of their muscles intact so I can properly visualize.  Honestly, John, if I have to explain why I’m doing everything I’m doing, this is going to take all day.”
“The next one can be very uncomfortable.   I’ll use a very small probe and insert it into the rectum.  I’ll be able to see your prostate.”
“Ah, tea.  Made to perfection, I’m sure.”  Sherlock smiled at John
Sherlock awoke before John the next morning, giving him enough time to sneak to the bathroom, and wipe away any evidence of his tears. He thanked his lucky stars he hadn’t had another wet dream.  He woke John with the closing of the door when he came back.
30th of July 1915
Well, maybe not kill.
“Cum for me then.” John whispered in sherlocks ear, making every hair stand on end.
The brunette slumped down the wall, breathless and flushed.
I can’t believe I love someone enough for this.
“No. How could I have? I didn’t know you were here till five minutes ago.” Mike chuckled, looking between both boys.
Sorry this is short... enjoy!
“Congratulations, Watson.” He beamed as he looked at the image.
I’m sure I’ll berate myself for that later, but I’m still battling the sea of emotions I’m experiencing right now.
“My younger sister is in an asylum for the criminally insane. Mycroft was worried I would end up going down a dark path... shooting myself up until I was an unresponsive, desolate shell of a person. That’s how he sees our sister.”
“I- “ John began but then decided that arguing with his brand new flatmate on their second day of living together was not the way to go. Instead, he glanced at Sherlock’s torso, covered by his long silk robe. John once again observed that Sherlock was very posh, despite his living conditions. And must be very rich to be able to afford a garment like that, though surely Scotland Yard doesn’t pay nearly that well. “How is your wound?”
His bare feet skidded and slipped on the hard, unforgiving cobblestones as he raced down the narrow street lined with waste bins and lazy cats that glanced at him tiredly from their perches. He stepped on something sharp but hardly felt it as the adrenaline roared through him. In the distance, just as the street opened up to a small alcove, he could see a man swinging viciously at Sherlock, who was ducking and swirling out of the way quickly and gracefully. John sped up and could now hear the angry grunts and growls of the man as he kept failing to land any hits. Just a few meters before John got to the alcove, two men appeared from the other end and charged at Sherlock.
Sherlock was at the main door’s threshold, staring at a little boy standing on the sidewalk with something in his outstretched hands. His whole body was trembling. John squinted to see what he had in his hands. It looked like an egg, covered in copper plating with small panels of frost glass that allowed the green glow of something inside to show through. Then all the blood drained from John’s face.
as he slammed the elbow of his free arm into the man’s nose. The man yelled out in shock and pain, letting go of John. John bent down slightly and then rammed his shoulder into the man’s chest just above his stomach, causing him to expel all his breath in a rush and the man staggered backwards, his arms flailing and his nose dripping blood profusely. John kicked the side of his knee hard and the man finally dropped down with a loud groan. John didn’t give the man a second look as he threw himself into the fray that was Sherlock trying to avoid being tackled to the ground by the two remaining men who looked worse for the wear. The skinny man had an arm locked tight around Sherlock’s chest from behind, though his other arm hung limply by his side. The first man was trying to grab at Sherlock’s kicking legs but his rapidly swelling eye was impeding much of his view. Sherlock landed a few kicks to the man’s ribs and just as the man seemed to get a hold of one of his feet, John crouched and threw himself right at the man, wrapping his arms around his waist and knocking them both to the ground. The man’s head hit the ground with a sickening crunch, his eyes wide with shock, and then he closed his eyes and went limp. John turned to go after the skinny man, but Sherlock had already managed to swing the man forward, and now grabbed his limp arm forcefully and quickly pushed him to the ground hard. The man howled in pain and writhed on the floor, holding his limp arm. Sherlock looked at him thoughtfully for a moment and crouched down to look at his face.
