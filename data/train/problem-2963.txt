“Angels have pure, white feathers, unless they give their allegiance a mortal over Heaven,” Matthias explained, “Every Angel who has made such a terrible choice has been killed or died a slow death. When Castiel was dragged back to Heaven and you met his vessel, there were a handful of grey feathers. After he helped you avert the Apocalypse, they all turned grey.”
Cas took the strange tablets without even asking what they were. Dean was oddly touched that Cas trusted him enough to follow his instructions without questioning what he was putting into his body.
“That last one was trouble,” Gabriel insisted, “Unless you’re looking for a date who also has a penis?”
“I like this suit, don’t dirty it with your Neanderthal fists,” Gabriel teased. He caught the next fist thrown at him in one hand and stopped it cold.
“He can be,” Cas agreed, “I suspect he is trying to give us some ‘alone’ time while I remain female.”
Sam turned his head to aim a cheeky smile at her, “You look great for your age; I’ll enjoy being a boy-toy.”
“I did not need that image,” Dean muttered as he accepted a cup of coffee Gabriel conjured from nowhere.
Dean slammed his fist into the wall, “Is this it?” he demanded, “We fight tooth and nail for years, then just give up when Chuck tells us to go away? No!”
Sam insisted on cooking, citing Dean as being a pain in the backside who tried to add bacon to everything. Before he headed out of the room Sam found a book on Dhampirs and handed it to Faith.
Castiel waited until the chosen movie was finished before approaching the issue of forming a Flock with characteristic bluntness.
Gabriel was trying not to be manipulative, which was why he was being honest. He felt like he had been obvious in guiding Dean to the idea of being a vessel for Castiel, yet it took the Hunter so long to reach the right conclusion.
“Evolution,” Castiel replied simply, “Father knew that feathers had to exist well before humans evolved. The wing design developed further in birds was based on Angel wings.”
“If I were to remove it now, you would make more jokes to distract you from thoughts of being more than just friends with me.”
The distress emanating from Lucifer was compelling. Gabriel was not sure if his brother would become suicidally depressed, homicidal or indifferent. Adding empathy to a sociopath was unpredictable, at best.
Dean hated that idea, and Gabriel knew it. The smirk the Archangel wore was infuriating to the elder Hunter. He also knew that reacting would only provoke Gabriel into being even more of an asshole.
Lucifer was reminded of Death retrieving Sam’s soul from the Cage; he had called both Archangels spoiled brats and ordered them to ‘knock it off’.
“That was unwise, Dean,” Cas said in the deep version of the woman’s voice, “Why are you trying to get yourself killed?”
Sam’s presence was barely noticeable, as though hiding from an Archangel with access to his brain was no longer a challenge.
Faith pulled him aside while Dean was making suggestions and arguing over the definition of ‘girly’ drinks with Gabriel.
“Kiss him, Castiel!” Gabriel teased, “I want to know if Michael can burst a blood vessel from in there.”
Gabriel liked how Castiel still retained his innocence; it was rather sweet. The Archangel had long ago given hope of finding a soulmate amongst the human population; he settled for orgasmic pleasure and hilarity.
“Are we good?” Sam inquired. He was not worried, as Dean would listen to Cas when nothing else would get through to him.
Gabriel chuckled as Samandriel immediately followed Adam, as though there was an invisible string connecting them.
Gabriel ignored the movie, as he had seen it before. He watched the way Castiel and Dean were wrapped around each other and wondered if they were each afraid that the other would disappear.
“I have claimed you as my charge,” the Angel explained, “We have to remain in physical contact for another hour.”
Sam lay sprawled on his side in the Nest room, once again questioning if he was experiencing reality or a weird dream.
Dean pointed the pool cue at the Archangel, “Any more talk like that and we’ll learn if I can beat you up in my own dream.”
“Dean, if you do anything which Father interprets as a threat to his plan, Castiel will be dragged back to Heaven and dumped in Naomi’s office for reprogramming,” Gabriel revealed.
“Linda has also returned home,” Crowley added, “No Demon will bother her. There are a few posted close enough to make sure no-one else tries to hurt her.”
“If you stopped hiding behind your Grace, you’d have a more educational experience,” Gabriel advised.
Faith wrinkled her nose at him, “Your body has aged more than mine, though. Does that make you a cradle-snatcher?”
Matthias trailed the tip of the Angel blade up the arm of her intended victim. She was lining up the angle to cut through the joint when Castiel started speaking in Enochian.
“I’ve warded the bunker against any Angel, except us,” Gabriel continued, “I used a pinch of your Grace, so it wouldn’t get thrown out.”
Samandriel offered a polite greeting before returning to his position pressed into Castiel. His head was tucked tightly under his sister’s chin and Gabriel was pressed against his back.
in the first Flock created in tens of thousands of years?” Balthazar drawled, “That sounds like a disaster in the making.”
“There were no humans; just Demons hiding from Angels,” Faith explained, “We should take Sam back to the bunker.”
“Good morning, Castiel,” Gabriel greeted cheekily, “What happened to the pair of boofheads you have been shadowing you?”
Faith hissed an affirmative reply into his hair. She felt his arms shift to indicate he had to put her down.
“You’re boring anyway,” Gabriel said snidely. He reached out to touch Sam on the arm and they both disappeared.
Sam grabbed the lock connecting the handcuff to the wall-chain and swiftly unlocked it. He produced a second key from his pocket and unlocked the handcuffs.
“Only mine, as I was forced to manifest them by one of Naomi’s minions,” Castiel said coldly, “The feathers she ripped out with pliers are slowly regrowing.”
“Metatron tricked another Angel into killing you,” Gabriel explained, “I have warned him, so he won’t be manipulated like that.”
“What?” Dean observed the expression he called ‘Bitchface No. 4’ on his brother. Usually, it indicated a serious problem or food poisoning.
“Your soul is pure,” Cas replied, his eyes fixed on the ceiling, “Scarred from Hell, but free of demonic taint.”
Castiel pulled out a chair and sat down heavily, “He sends you back in time, but can’t even answer one bloody prayer from me?”
Gabriel was mildly interested in the dynamic between Meg and Sam. The history they shared should have led to a mutual hatred, yet they were almost friends.
“I’ve missed you, Gabriel,” Castiel said abruptly, “I wish you had been with me when Raphael was trying to restart the Apocalypse.”
The shame emanating from Dean appeared as a dark purple glow across his chest, “I don’t want to take that risk.”
A wave of recognition prompted Dean to sit up straight, “That’s it; I can feel where you are without looking. Is that bad?”
“I don’t know, but you remind me of a faded Nephilim,” Gabriel decided, “I can see your Grace being affected too, Castiel. You might end up sharing the power of a Nephilim between the two of you.”
Sam propped himself up on one elbow to see past Faith. Dean was stretched out on a third bed and Sam was grateful his brother was also fully clothed.
“Not as effective against Dhampirs,” Dean mused, “I wonder if that’s already in the book she was reading.”
Before Faith could reply, Gabriel appeared. As the first Demon was burned from the inside-out, a ring of Holy Fire was ignited around him.
“Good,” Cas purred, running one hand through Dean’s hair and another along his neck, “I enjoy being close to you.”
“I told Michael and Lucifer that humans did not deserve to be slaughtered and their plan was unjust,” Castiel replied lightly.
“Homosexuality was never a sin,” Chuck said with a huff, “Clearly, it needed to be more widespread to limit the population.”
The Archangel clicked his fingers; Dean and Castiel disappeared. He glanced over to where Sam and Faith were sleeping, and decided to relocate them, too.
Dean distinctly heard a deep laugh from the wall where the door should have been. Castiel glanced at the same place, so the Hunter knew he wasn’t hallucinating.
“Gabriel is here to supervise, and make sure I don’t bleed out if you damage an artery,” Sam explained calmly.
“No, I mean, do we have to explore my memories?” Dean asked, “Can’t you snuggle with the missing piece of Grace while we wander through your head?”
Faith watched the older Hunter stick up his middle finger at Gabriel before he stomped away. Gabriel grinned after him.
“Is this some sort of revenge for my betrayal of you?” Castiel asked the Demon coldly, “I’ve refrained from ripping your spine out through your mouth only because Sam complains about mess in the library.”
Sam tried to initiate a conversation three more times and was repeatedly ignored. He was reminded of a time in a library a year earlier when he had been ignoring the image of Lucifer.
“Castiel cleans out his arteries regularly,” Gabriel explained, “Do you extend your skills to liposuction, too?”
Castiel regarded Dean with an expression which could only be described as condescending, “I am an Angel; I am not male or female. Both are equally strange to me.”
“Faith, this is our brother Samandriel,” Gabriel introduced politely, “Samandriel, this is Faith; Dhampir and mate of Sam Winchester.”
Dean’s eyes were drawn to the trembling wings perched on the Angel’s back. He could see the individual feathers shaking.
“Why would he do that?” there was a plea in Balthazar’s voice which prompted Gabriel to flex his invisible wing around him.
“I just found out that I could be responsible for killing so many Angels, we end up on the verge of extinction,” Castiel said bitterly, “Factor in last year and I am the worst mass-murderer in the history of the world, including Lucifer.”
Lucifer felt Sam shift to listen to the conversation, even if he refused to interact with the Archangel.
Faith levelled a glare at the floor, “Both little fingers. The left one was cut off twice, just to make sure it wasn’t a fluke.”
Sam listened to Lucifer mutter his disinterested agreement while he struggled to answer the question.
Cas met his gaze with a knowing smirk, “Faith is voicing her opinions rather incessantly,” he explained.
Dean blinked across at the wide, blue eyes which were fixed on him, “Hell, yeah. I am done saving the world because I’m the only one dumb enough to step up. God himself wants me to stand down, so I am officially on vacation.”
“I found something like that in my room, but I thought they were weird undergarments,” Faith realized.
A second man stood up and quickly approached the panicked human, “Samuel Winchester, do you need assistance?”
“In a sense; there are different types of soul-bonds,” Gabriel explained, “You are correct; the three of you are connected closely enough that all of you need to choose this together.”
Meg allowed Gabriel to seek the truth in her mind. The memories of her host dying rose to the surface.
“Intentions matter,” Gabriel said simply, “Screwing up is forgivable if you have good intentions – Castiel is a prime example of that.”
Gabriel was extremely bored. The Winchesters were interviewing witnesses and connecting bodies to their Werewolf hunt. Apparently, it was interesting because the kills were happening throughout the month rather than just at the full moon.
Sam lifted the unresponsive woman up bridal style, making sure to tuck her head forward against his shoulder.
Gabriel appeared in front of Castiel, already sitting comfortably in a chair with a glass of wine in one hand. Castiel flinched violently and spat out a string of swear words in Enochian.
“That depends on you, Dean,” Castiel said lightly, “I am content to remain in your life in whatever capacity you choose. If you wish to remain friends, I will remain with you until the day you die and then be a frequent visitor to your Heaven.”
Castiel sat up and shifted so he was sitting next to Faith. Gabriel moved to sit on the remaining section of the couch.
Two Angels held Castiel by the arms. The handcuffs carved with sigils were still on his wrists, and the chain between them had been restored.
“I’ve always found the human preoccupation with alcohol to be confusing; even now I’m not sure why it is so popular,” Castiel admitted.
“Angels are trained to be soldiers,” Castiel said with a hint of sadness, “We are not supposed to indulge in emotions.”
The Men of Letters bunker was quiet and peaceful. There was no indication that a certain Archangel had been sent back in time, or that Chuck had interfered even further back.
“Why rush it?” Lucifer asked rhetorically, “We know what he’s going to say; ‘I was doing my duty, blah, blah, blah; I don’t regret locking you away for thousands of years of torture; blah blah’.”
Castiel didn’t want Dean to leave, and he felt even worse knowing that he couldn’t accompany the brothers to keep them safe. Gabriel had grudgingly agreed to keep an eye on them to appease Castiel, tactfully leaving out that he had planned on watching them anyway.
Gabriel checked in with the Winchester troublemakers; they were winding up the case in St. Louis on schedule. The Archangel deliberately ignored the silent pleas from Sam; he had no intention of flying the taller Hunter back to the bunker to feed Faith.
Gabriel recognised Naomi as the speaker. He grinned into the darkness and considered the best way to word a reply to piss off the uppity Angel.
Sam was unconscious and pinned down by three Demons holding Angel blades. Faith was held tightly by two Demons; one on each arm.
“What do you think of the church groups who are claiming you are a false prophet of God?” the interviewer asked carefully.
“Then, I’ll cut one of Dean’s fingers off,” Matthias said softly. She moved the hand not burdened by the blade into a wave. The gag disappeared from Dean.
Gabriel provided a range of pie and ice-cream for dessert while Michael watched the memories of Castiel as ‘God’.
“And God chose her for Sammy? He’s made some crazy choices in the past; I’m worried he has a monster-fetish or something,” Dean said thoughtfully.
Dean could feel the weight of every decision he had ever made dragging him down. He realized that he had been intent on saving others for so damn long that he had nothing left to give. The deaths of his friends and knowledge of their fates in the other timeline cast doubt on his ability to continue.
“That book I read said Dhampirs make excellent Vampire hunters; it makes sense that I should have some advantages. Gabriel ripped a few pages out, but the rest was informative.”
Venting emotions simply to reduce their power had been an important lesson. The Angel could easily recall a moment when he had been similarly enthralled by anger; in the alley when he had beaten Dean to the ground for trying to say ‘yes’ to Michael. He still felt a pang of guilt when he recalled kicking Dean into the chain-link fence; not just for the pain he had inflicted, but because he had enjoyed the adrenalin of the moment.
Faith watched Sam walk around the bed while Dean kept a hand pressed down on her shoulder. Lust, in multiple forms, surged within her as the taller brother drew closer.
“Emotions are troublesome, and very hard to control,” Castiel mused, “I never realized how overpowering they can be.”
Gabriel had to shove Castiel out of the Nest room and promise that Dean was deeply asleep. She re-joined the Angels watching the movie and monitoring Dean via their telepathic link.
Michael could feel the unspoken sentiments which Castiel had recognised years ago; Dean still didn’t think he deserved to be saved.
Lucifer nearly dropped the book he was holding when he turned around to find Sam standing far too close.
Sam had trouble reconciling the description of Lucifer with the agony he had experienced in the Cage.
Gabriel used his Grace to push down the anger and lingering shame associated with Asmodeus. He kept his attention on Dean, who shifted straight into protective big-brother mode at the sight of Adam.
“I meant the pain went away when we touched,” Dean clarified, rubbing one hand over his heart, “Like something with claws was trapped in my chest and fighting to get out.”
“That never happened,” Lucifer said while waving his hand toward the door, “It’s my turn to share Cage memories. I can still feel the pressure demanding I that I be truthful, so I can’t pull any tricks.”
Castiel returned the clothing to the bathroom, though the thought of disrobing in front of Dean was interesting.
Gabriel smiled condescendingly, “That key opens other bunkers too. These two are going to need a place to ‘get to know each other’ and I’d prefer not to hear them having sex. Why knows what weird shit Balthazar is into?”
“I said I would release Sam, which I will,” Matthias clarified, “And I won’t hurt Dean if you cooperate.”
“Yeah, right,” Faith scoffed, “You’re going to annoy the stuffing out of them to keep them from doing something stupid.”
“When we’re hunting, you don’t miss a thing,” Sam teased, “But when you’re chasing skirt, you’re hopeless.”
Castiel watched Michael beg Dean to let him keep his Grace without pity. He recalled being cut off from Heaven and was not fond of the memories of being human.
“Theoretically, you would be the best option,” Gabriel said carefully, “But the bond you share with Castiel might complicate the Angel-vessel paradigm.”
“Chuck explained that you always had empathy, but the Mark suppressed it,” Sam pointed out, “I didn’t infect you; just reactivated it.”
“I can’t force Jane to do anything,” Faith explained as she placed the plate in front of Castiel and handed him some cutlery, “I asked her to give you a chance.”
Gabriel shrugged, “I’ve been called worse. You two would be dead if it wasn’t for me. You should be thanking me.”
The moans and pants from Cas were fascinating. Dean could feel his own erection pressed firmly against the pliant backside of the Angel.
Sam joined his brother as the whole shelf separated from the wall to reveal a staircase leading down into the darkness. The air smelled stale, but not putrid.
Gabriel reached forward and pressed two fingers against his forehead. Sam recoiled instinctively as he received the memories.
“I’d like your permission to view the memories Gabriel spoke about,” Sam stated, “He can be an ass, but he usually knows what he’s talking about.”
“Other supernatural creatures will be drawn to the raw power of your incomplete bond,” Chuck warned, “You don’t want to know how many creatures want to taste-test the mate of an Angel.”
The trip back to the bunker was slightly better, but Lucifer was still feeling awful as he followed Faith and Gadreel to Sam’s room.
The coldness in her chest prevented Castiel from answering. Chuck had known of his disloyalty all along; was that why he refused to be found?
“To keep the bond strong and healthy,” Castiel explained, “Gabriel is sure that physical contact and emotional closeness can recharge it.”
The Dhampir had no interest in exploring pornography, so she had suggested he wait until she was asleep to work on that project.
Sam looked around Stull cemetery with a sinking heart. His stomach was knotted up so tightly, he was glad dinner had been postponed in favour of their field trip.
“Probably not,” Sam admitted before addressing Lucifer, “But if you’re honest from the outset, I will trust you eventually.”
“Anna described Angels as being cold and lacking emotion,” Dean recalled in a quiet voice, “I know she was wrong, but I can’t tell how similar human and Angel emotions are.”
“Are you hungry?” Gabriel asked Adam, “These two are in ‘over-protective big-brother’ mode, so food might be the only way to pry them away for a few minutes.”
Sam and Charlie were just close enough to hear Dean demand to know where Cas was, while talking to Faith.
Castiel had his eyes closed but was still awake when he heard Faith speaking to someone. He opened one eye to see Gabriel peering down at him.
Dean ignored the Archangel so he could line up his shot. The pool cue slip between his fingers to strike the ball with practised precision.
“What is holding you back?” Gabriel asked, “Other than my charming company, why would you want to remain in this reality?”
“Cas; you should be blasting a hole through the wall to get us out of here,” Dean sighed, “Why aren’t you fighting this?”
“You don’t have to move, Cas,” Dean muttered. He sat next to Castiel, with his back resting against the headboard.
“Sammy?” Dean’s voice was strained and held a note of fear associated with impending trouble, “Wake up!”
Jack nodded, “A fair few actually; you visited one where there were no supernatural elements at all. The weird thing is, they all have stories and most have a Bible. I think the Prophets were active, or someone was travelling through portals to impersonate them.”
Sam was beginning to worry that Faith had left the bunker when he felt her presence through their bond.
There was a silent explosion of self-hatred in Sam’s mind which left Gabriel clutching the cushions with gritted teeth.
Sam glanced at Faith, who pressed her palm against his spine to encourage him to accept the invitation.
“I’m cold and empty,” Lucifer clarified, “Because the only sliver of Grace in my body is the equivalent of a human soul.”
A second man was pulled into view. His wrists were handcuffed, and his shoulders were slumped. His posture indicated acute misery.
“Once Castiel and Dean are fully bonded, I’m going to ask for volunteers from the Host to seek out compatible human souls. I think you would be an asset in determining if the humans truly understand what is being asked of them, and if Angels know enough about humanity to participate.”
Faith sighed with relief when Gabriel, Balthazar and Jane disappeared. If Balthazar had attacked Castiel, the resulting fight would have been devastating. Her first concern was how she could possibly protect Sam.
Castiel pulled away abruptly and looked at the wrist Dean was holding up. A small circle was burned into the skin of his left wrist.
Sam had avoided thinking of Lucifer quite deliberately. As he enjoyed a hot shower, thoughts of the pain-in-the-ass Archangel crept into his thoughts.
Castiel shrugged, a gesture he had picked up from the Winchesters, “I don’t see the point of getting angry; that’s probably what Gabriel wants.”
Samandriel staggered forward, his eyes fixed on Castiel. Dean remained close to Cas, wondering if Samandriel was going to attack the Angel who had killed him.
“Maybe,” Gabriel agreed lightly, “But those two have a habit of succeeding when it doesn’t seem possible.”
Gabriel drew Sam and Faith out of the dream of the Cage to find Castiel and Dean making out like horny teenagers.
“Once Paradise on Earth is achieved, Demons can be purified and Hell closed,” Michael explained offhandedly.
Castiel was deep in thought when Gabriel appeared next to the bed. He couldn’t control the sharp movement of alarm which cause him to startle comically.
Sam wasn’t close enough to hear the conversation, but his head snapped to the side to focus on Faith when dread energized her system. He was half out of his seat before he realized he hadn’t seen or heard anything to warrant intervention.
“I feel the same about the possibility of your death,” Castiel pointed out, “I fear that if you make any plans against Chuck, he will return the memories of Hell I erased to keep you sane.”
Seeing the Hunter prone on the bed unsettled Lucifer. The smell of blood hung heavily in the air and did not help his upset stomach.
Faith moaned involuntarily at the taste. She could only compare it to crossing a desert, finding an oasis and diving in.
“There is more,” Chuck confirmed, “There are too many humans on the planet. My most amazing creation is nature, and humans are destroying it.”
“I monitor your emotions, and only dream-walk when you are distressed,” Castiel explained, “Privacy is an odd concept, but you deem it important.”
“Yes. We’re linked now. It’s strange to feel him out there somewhere. Do you feel like that with Dean because he has some of your Grace?”
Kevin sat between Jane and Faith, his eyes darting between the three Archangels regularly. He was clearly upset about something.
“You’re welcome,” Gabriel said softly, sounding sincere, “Dean has a generous offer to discuss with you, and I expect you to accept it.”
“We were equally startled, I think. While we are in physical contact, the emotional connection is easier to read,” Cas explained.
Samandriel smiled happily, “It is lovely to meet you, Jane. Don’t worry; everyone knows Balthazar has no manners. Zachariah postulated that he got too close to a star going supernova as a Fledgling.”
“Before I send you back, ask Sam for some tips on approaching him,” Chuck suggested, “It’s not like we have a time limit.”
The shy smile on Castiel’s face was entertaining in itself; the awestruck expression on Dean’s face forced Gabriel to suppress a litany of comments.
Gabriel converted one of the spare bedrooms into a Nest suitable for his Flock. He stood back to admire the multiple beds he had managed to cram into the room. Though the couples would keep other rooms, he was sure the urge to sleep near the Flock would hit regularly.
The brothers shared a glance of disdain before Dean spoke, “Have you met us? We’re all about thwarting plans.”
“I like it,” Castiel replied sagely, “So many of my siblings are manipulative and have no sense of humour. With Gabriel, I know what he is thinking because it flies right out of his mouth.”
Dean regarded Gabriel thoughtfully. The Archangel blew him a kiss and wiggled his eyebrows suggestively.
“Both would provide good lessons,” Gabriel mused, “But if we form a Flock, no Angel can get in without my approval.”
“I am really not surprised that Faith and I were manipulated into being here. From what I read about Angels, they are unscrupulous assholes, but they do need permission to occupy a vessel?”
“You are both of those things, too,” Castiel assured him, “And, I have been rather possessive of you in the past; I simply hid it better.”
“This is bullshit!” Dean declared, “We stopped the damn Apocalypse while you sat around in your bath robe; don’t bring it back because you’re bored!”
“Your interest in my relationship with Dean is becoming rather irritating,” Castiel pointed out with a disapproving frown.
Gabriel relaxed slightly, “Amara is like Chuck, in that she can exist in multiple realities. The removal of the Mark of Cain released her into that Universe; as long as the Mark remains intact in this one, we’re safe from her.”
Castiel stared at the floor thoughtfully, “Only members of the required bloodline and Angels can see the aftereffects of my Grace.”
“Castiel just told me about Claire and Amelia. Before they arrived here, they found Amelia and returned her to Claire,” Faith said sadly.
Gabriel sighed, “You want the numbers? I can prove that Dad has killed more than you without declaring war.”
“In a few dozen realities, locking you away worked,” Chuck continued, “So, I began triggering branching universes by attempting to reason with you and let you out. I watched you slaughter Phoenicians, Greeks, Romans, Chinese, Egyptians and everyone in-between throughout the Ancient World. No matter what I did, you were always intent on wiping out humanity.”
Meg remained slouched back so Dean and Castiel could see each other. Flirting with the Angel was fun, but she could see there was something brewing with the Hunter.
“You’re not worried, but Castiel has never had to listen to you scream as appendages are cut off. How many fingers and toes will I take before he does as he is told?”
Dean slid out of bed, thankful that he was wearing boxers. Had he been naked, Enochian symbols to bar Angels would begin appearing throughout the bunker.
“We’re not modelling anything,” Faith said bluntly, “Will you provide clothing, or am I taking Castiel shopping?”
Purgatory was a fitting punishment for the devastation he had wrought in Heaven, no matter how noble his intentions had been. Castiel resented Naomi for pulling him out, but he had not realized how badly he had been tortured until Gabriel shoved the excruciating details into his mind.
Faith finally look up at him, “Don’t be jealous, Dean. Your blood smells delicious too. The scent is mostly blocked by the aura of protection around you.”
“I agree,” Gabriel said gleefully, “Though it took me centuries on Earth to figure that out. I like your plan, Deano.”
“There’s your answer,” Dean said with a smile, “Crappy leaders love having butt-kissers around to prop up their egos. If Michael had appeared in a dream and explained the whole plan, I might have gone along with it.”
Adam stared at the man who had spoken. It took him a full four seconds to recall why he looked familiar. He pulled himself into a sitting position without taking his eyes away from the face which appeared in so many of his memories.
Dean didn’t even look up from the laptop. He was scanning online newspapers for any signs of suspicious activity. He was in the mood for a classic ghost hunt.
“Nice; these kept you from being found,” Matthias realized, “As we can’t recall you to Heaven while you have them on. Where’s the key?”
“I’m picking up Samandriel, as he has a mission to complete,” Chuck explained easily, “But I do have something else in mind.”
“We should ask everyone, including Dean and Sam,” Castiel said tightly, “If they want her here, that’s fine.”
Faith rarely went to bed before midnight and preferred to sleep until noon. While in a cell, her sleeping habits had adapted to her Dhampir nature and she had seen no reason to try to alter them.
Sam climbed to his feet and began to stalk toward her, “No argument there; I’m still annoyed you fed on Cas.”
“I’m not good at talking, Cas,” Dean said honestly, “If being your vessel for a while will sort this out, you have my consent.”
Dean pushed aside thoughts of horny Demons to preserve his sanity. He wondered if Cas was interested in Meg for a moment, before quashing the thought.
“And you think you can convince the most stubborn man in existence to change his mind?” Sam asked with a disbelieving chuckle.
Dean glanced at Castiel’s hands, which rested near his own. He reached out to catch both and entwined their fingers together again.
Dean felt Michael stir, his thoughts on memories of refusing to share Grace with Lucifer. He longed to connect with his closest sibling that way.
Gabriel remained at the bunker, promising he was only a prayer away if something went seriously wrong.
“Would you be ‘over it’ if Dean threw you out of the house and your family spread rumours throughout the world that you were to blame for
Gabriel found Castiel in the storeroom, as expected. His brother liked to be useful, and he enjoyed the tedious work. Gabriel understood many things, but not that.
“Cas, being human is a huge change; feeling shitty is a part of that. The great thing about being so depressed you want to die is knowing tomorrow is most likely to be much better,” Dean offered.
As far as Castiel knew, an Angel had never fully bonded with a human soul. A touch could leave a mark, and prolonged contact left a permanent connection like he had with Dean.
It took a few minutes for the Archangel to show up. When he appeared, he was sitting on the chair with his feet on the table.
The atmosphere remained solemn, even with Balthazar describing alternate uses for various food items. Castiel would never look at honey the same way.
Castiel wanted to reassure the Hunter, but the memories of the original timeline had illustrated the folly of lying to his friends, “I don’t know.”
“Don’t be a jerk,” Jane scoffed, “I want to see if Dean will jump to defend his Angel’s honour without boobs to prompt him.”
Chuck watched humans across the globe adjust to their new reality. Seeing the Angels interact with people without a world-ending agenda was immensely satisfying.
Dean could hear an echo of the conversation Cas had with Balthazar, though their shared Grace. Images of Leviathans, insanity, Purgatory and torture at the hands of Naomi were offered to Balthazar.
It took Sam a full second to comprehend how he ended up with a pair of lycra-covered breasts level with his face and his hands supporting a supple backside.
“Sure. They’re impressive, but from the way the psycho lady was talking, they’re private? I didn’t really get it,” Dean admitted.
The bickering turned into Gabriel denying he had ever had sex with a horse, which left Michael wearing an expression of disgust.
“It’s not a zoo when people ask to go there, and they can leave at any time,” Chuck reminded him, “I’ll also have Angels tasked with cleaning up the planet; pulling plastic out of the ocean is a priority.”
“Probably,” Castiel replied thoughtfully, “We had to be highly compatible in the first place, for me to get you out of Hell.”
Gabriel twirled a bottle cap on the table, “In Heaven, Castiel had his emotions continually ripped out of his mind. Spending time with you two allowed him to develop far beyond the limitations of any Angel. He wasn’t really living until he chose you over Heaven,” he directed the last sentence directly to Dean.
Faith watched Sam bolt from the room without hesitation. She tensed, fighting the urge to chase him down to sink her fangs into his neck. She could only compare it to the worst chocolate craving multiplied by a factor of ten.
Lucifer liked the ‘Alien’ movie. He was impressed by the creativity humans expressed via the television. He hated the admit he was wrong about humanity, and he would never utter the sentiment aloud. He disliked the vast majority of the human population, but they could be interesting.
“I have forgiven Father for my time in the Cage,” Lucifer admitted, “But forcing me to experience the human digestive system is a whole new grudge.”
The dull ache of his wrists, the pulsing waves of agony in his wings and the throbbing headache merged until he was unaware of the movements around him.
Dean slowly released Castiel’s wrist and shifted so he was lying on his side to face the worried Angel. He was glad that he was below the blankets, while Castiel was on top of them. His eyes were drawn to the wing which curved over the bed.
The tips of the longest feather peeked over the tan fabric as Castiel offered a shy smile, “I’ve hidden them for so long, I had an emotional response when you looked at them again.”
Dean found Cas in the room he had been guided into the previous night. He was lying on the bed in the foetal position, in an echo of his collapse onto the bed while drunk. Thankfully, Cas was sober this time; Dean refused to dwell on the memory of helping Cas undress.
“So, I’ll be the tie-breaker,” Faith offered, “I plan to be near Sam for as long as he can tolerate me.”
Faith retrieved the book on Dhampirs and retreated to her room to read. She didn’t want to risk running into Dean if he expected her to be still handcuffed to the bed.
Dean followed the scent of bacon through the bunker. He had a mouthful of food when he realized there were two additional guests watching him.
“Not stupid; try desperate,” Gabriel corrected, “Though Lucifer acting like a petulant child was pretty funny, even if it was a second-hand memory.”
“Crowley is kind of an ally, now,” Gabriel said from behind Samandriel, “We’ll keep him away from you.”
For a few days an unexpected tranquillity spread through the bunker. The news continued to document growing unrest and outright revolt across the world, but Gabriel let his calm confidence flow through to his Flock.
A blue glow in her eyes indicated Cas had taken control. Dean was startled by the wave of relief he felt when Faith abruptly sat up.
“Should Sam and Faith be here for the next crisis?” Gabriel asked blandly, “I would snap them here, but Sam is in the shower and Faith is still asleep.”
Dean’s presence was snuggled in next to Castiel, a reflection of their reality. It was so sweet, Gabriel wanted to throw up on the pair of them.
Sam rolled his eyes. The trip to the outside of the bunker was instantaneous, so he was looking at the door by the time Dean made a comment about the pilot being a douche.
“Michael assumed I was in league with Lucifer, and never bothered to find out the truth,” Gadreel said stiffly, “When Father found out that I had been tricked, he freed me.”
Lucifer heard a strange noise coming from his stomach. The odd ache in his abdomen had been easy to ignore before Gabriel provided an abundance of food.
“The Romans were quite comfortable with nudity,” Castiel said apologetically, “Keeping track of all human taboos would be inefficient.”
“No; it will ensure she goes to Heaven with you, when you die. She will probably be able to dream with you and pull you out of nightmares when I’m busy.”
“’Satan’ was actually a verb, meaning ‘to tempt’,” Gabriel informed the brothers cheerfully, “It got mixed up in translation.”
“Listen here, muttonheads! Just because I don’t waste my manners on you doesn’t mean I don’t have them.”
Finally, he seemed to relax. Blue eyes darted around the room which was illuminated by the light in the hall.
Gabriel sighed, “I’m as conflicted as you, where big brother is concerned. He practically raised me, and I love him, but he can also be an asshole with the temperament of a toddler. It’s more than acceptable to be unsure of your feelings toward him.”
The sound of someone unlocking the door to her room sent her heart rate through the roof. She could sense that the dawn was still hours away.
“Yes, once the feathers regrow; though he won’t be back to full power until he moults completely. The stronger the vessel, the easier it will be,” Gabriel explained.
“Publicity,” Lucifer said with a snort, “This way, he’s ‘saving the world’ instead of destroying it.”
Sam glared at his brother but remained silent. Faith surmised that Dean had won an argument over the issue while she was showering.
Gabriel didn’t need sleep, but he did relax into a state of deep meditation. He allowed Angel radio to filter through when he felt sufficiently rested, so he could monitor the Angels.
“Is that my punishment?” Castiel continued, “To have to listen to you prattle on like this? You have no idea how I feel, or why.”
Lucifer pulled his knees up to his chest and wrapped his arms around his legs, “I don’t know what I feel,” he mumbled.
It didn’t take long for the rest of the Angels to give their opinions on the depictions of Angels. Samandriel was clearly fascinated, to the point that he couldn’t tear his eyes away from the screen.
“You were meant to go to Purgatory, Castiel,” Gabriel said gently, “Dean wouldn’t be nearly as strong without that year and you needed to learn that you belong with these two twits.”
Gabriel narrowed his eyes at the Dhampir hosting his sibling. He waved a hand to keep their conversation private.
Castiel lowered his head to the pillow and his hand slipped from Dean’s shoulder to rest on the mattress.
“Without a human soul, Castiel is more connected to her body,” Gabriel explained, “The bond with Dean is allowing for more human traits to emerge; she can taste and is currently asleep.”
“How about you come back to talk about each reality as you create it?” Sam suggested, “Do you have to start at the beginning each time?”
“Am I wearing everything correctly?” Castiel asked worriedly, “Gabriel assisted with the bra, and the shoelaces. I’m glad the trench-coat still fits.”
“Think of me as a meteor circling the sun,” Castiel mused as his eyes fluttered shut once more, “I crossed your path and got caught in your gravity. We are still orbiting the sun, but the centre of my existence is you.”
All the Angels froze when Chuck turned to glare at the camera, “All Angels not already involved in transporting humans to Sanctuary need to report to my position. Jane can watch over the bunker.”
“Don’t take lessons in emotional communication from those two,” Faith warned, “Like most men, they wouldn’t know how to identify a deep emotion if it bit them on the butt.”
“Let’s go kill the Wicked Witch,” Gabriel suggested, “If Meg and Charlie are in Oz when Chuck does his thing, they won’t be affected.”
“You have the missing part of his Grace fused to your soul,” Gabriel said, which led to a blush climbing Dean’s neck, “I suspect you would be completely aware, even if Castiel tried to bury you in memories.”
The Vampire nest was a complete disappointment. Once the wards were destroyed, Balthazar announced that the building was empty.
“Sleeping is disturbing,” Castiel intoned thoughtfully, “Losing control and losing the ability to think properly while drunk was bad enough. Knowing it will happen again fills me with dread.”
Dean threw aside the pillow, and turned to face the confused Angel, “This isn’t ‘ill’, Cas. This is frustration with the Dope of the Universe. Stop trying to throw your life away; it pisses me off!”
Gabriel removed the handcuffs while muttering in Enochian. From his tone, he was saying something very unflattering.
Dean could sense Michael analysing his memories for interactions with Uriel, which were evoked by the mention of the Angel. Learning that Anna had killed Uriel to save Castiel surprised Michael.
“I should be human, like in that other timeline,” Castiel argued, “But this time I won’t have sex with a woman possessed by a Reaper. Does that make her my sister or a cousin?”
Castiel had known Gabriel long enough to know he should not follow any advice the Archangel gave in that tone.
“Not since you lot averted the Apocalypse,” Chuck replied happily, “Since then, I’ve just enjoyed the ride. When it got too bumpy, I sent Gabriel back to smooth it out.”
“Oh, yes. She has a strange preoccupation with Castiel,” Gabriel mused, “If he’s going to experience sex as a male, she’s willing.”
“We exorcised a few Demons,” Sam recalled, uncomfortable that the chin of the Angel was resting on top of his head, “Some asshole grabbed us.”
“I can’t maintain this much longer,” Castiel warned, “If I lose consciousness, I could be drawn into any memory.”
“Castiel says it doesn’t matter who loves you, Gabriel, as you love yourself more than enough to make up any shortfall.”
“Thank-you for answering,” Castiel managed, annoyed that he couldn’t hide the human reaction when an Angel appeared abruptly.
“Castiel is surprised that I don’t avoid emotions as though they were rabid Hellhounds,” Faith explained when Sam regarded her curiously.
The memories finally ended and Castiel regained control of his body. He opened his eyes and realised his vision was blurred with tears.
“I’m sure it’s better when it’s operational,” Sam consoled, “You just wanted to flirt with girls in costumes.”
“It’s a game,” Dean said as he straightened up, “Think of it as a ritual humans use to help support an awkward friendship.”
“Your soul is as easy as you at a bar on St Patrick’s Day,” Gabriel explained as he put the handcuffs on Faith’s wrists, “If Castiel hadn’t fled, your soul would have fully merged with his Grace.”
Sam stumbled backward and wondered if being struck by lightning was comparable to receiving the Grace of an Archangel.
“If Gabriel can successfully convert my former vessel to a female, possibly,” Castiel replied honestly.
“No fertility mark for me,” Faith mused, “I assumed as much, or I would have been pregnant decades ago.”
Gabriel lifted his head to smirk at Dean, “Get over here, you stubborn jackass; you’re a part of this too.”
Gabriel figured that since he wasn’t getting any, Dean should suffer through a drought, too. The tricky part was humiliating Dean in a way that did not reflect suspicion back onto himself.
Sam wrapped his arms around Faith and pulled her back against his chest. Her wrist pulled at the restraint instinctively and her eyes remained locked on Gabriel.
“Kevin moved to the Chapter House where Jane and Balthazar are staying,” Gabriel explained, “He is locked in a private room with headphones on to block the sound of every other room being desecrated by horny celestial beings.”
Jane didn’t want Castiel to wake up and ruin the girl-bonding time. She immediately chastised herself for being such a bitch, but the resentment was still there.
“I will announce that Jane is not to be harmed, but remain cautious,” Chuck advised, “I would not be surprised to find a faction of Angels who embrace Free Will and want to rebel against my plans, particularly when I am absent.”
Castiel seemed to be staring past her, “Without my Grace, I cannot leave unless I die a mortal death. I’m not sure what would happen after that.”
Gabriel offered a small smile, “There’s no easy fix, I’m afraid. Sometimes, talking about it can help.”
“I’m rather fond of Meg,” Gabriel confirmed, “And I’d rather not watch Dean drool over Castiel on a full stomach.”
Linda and Kevin were preparing dinner in the kitchen. Gabriel had tried to ‘help’ but had been chased away by Linda wielding a wooden spoon.
“What are you on about, Sammy?” Dean asked with a disapproving frown, “We’re staying right here until he wakes up.”
“Blunt, as always,” Gabriel observed with a smile, “I do want a Flock; though I never found people I could trust before. I am more concerned with your motives; I won’t bind you to my Grace unless you truly want to be a part of my Flock.”
The pulse of shock which shuddered through Castiel prompted him to clutch at Dean’s arm with both hands. Dean pushed his body up to sit next to Cas.
“Sorry, Luci,” Gabriel wheezed, “The image of Sam chasing you around with a garden hose is just too funny.”
The sight of Dean and Gabriel curled up on either side of Lucifer rendered Sam speechless for a full ten seconds.
The pained expression on Sam’s face evoked a flash of guilt which Faith ignored. She watched the anger in Sam fuel the determination in his movements.
The Archangel had his legs stretched out in front of him, and his back supported by the middle of the lounge.
Faith had heard the rushed conversation and Jane’s abrupt departure, “Who’s Balthazar?” she asked sleepily.
The bond flared between them insistently, ensuring that they were aware of the mutual lust between them. Castiel recognised the mix of emotions as love and was not insulted when Dean pulled away.
“Bare minimum,” Faith assured him, “If you didn’t share it with Dean, it wasn’t given to me. There was nothing too explicit, I promise.”
“Don’t knock it until you’ve tried it. I know Daphne was too pious to take advantage of you while your memories were screwed up.”
“That’s hard to believe,” Dean snorted. He turned to speak to Faith/Castiel just as she shifted forward. The sight of blood on Sam’s collar sent a surge of alarm through the Hunter.
The show was full of amazing colours, but she had trouble concentrating on the storyline. She barely noticed when a second person sat down at the other end of the couch.
“Sam suggested it,” Lucifer protested, “His first idea involved the winner sitting on the loser and posing for a photo.”
“I think I just locked his powers away,” Sam admitted, “Not sure how, exactly, but he’s experiencing human emotions. Or maybe Angel emotions which are usually controlled with Grace? Either way, he’s struggling.”
Unfortunately, Gabriel was unable to ignore the whispered conversation Faith was trying to have with Sam.
Angels were revealing themselves and people were panicking. Thousands of people had prayed for help and been relocated to the islands Chuck had mentioned.
Something deep inside broke as he watched the Angels fall, their wings burning off from the friction. The memories of living as a human were humiliating, but nothing could have prepared him for the disappointment and abandonment which flooded him when Dean kicked him out of the bunker.
“We’re in human vessels, discussing pornography and your future vanilla seduction of Dean Winchester; human milestones are quite relevant,” Gabriel decided, “I’ve had male lovers in the past, but Dean isn’t my type; he talks too much. That’s why I suggested the ball-gag.”
“You didn’t tell them that we’d have control,” Dean realized with a snort, “No wonder Michael is pissed at both of us right now.”
Dean hadn’t felt so safe, warm and utterly relaxed since his mother had been alive. He watched his brother accept the extended hands with a lazy smile. He saw the moment when years of suffering were soothed by the muted Grace of both Angels.
Faith could see the resemblance easily enough; the dark hair and blue eyes were obvious. The shape of Castiel’s new face was also reminiscent of her own.
Faith giggled, “Dean, I can see you are torn between outrage and a fantasy involving sleeping with four women at once.”
Castiel was surprised when Dean asked for help to fall asleep. He had expected Dean to withdraw in every way possible after admitting to being haunted by his time in Hell.
Lucifer was equally relieved and irritated when Sam entered the box and settled into a seated position across from him.
“That was with Lucifer and a bunch of humans, right?” Sam clarified, “He could have screwed with their heads; we can’t assume any Flock would mirror one with the Devil in it.”
Michael crossed his arms over his chest, “Father thinks I can learn something from you. Proceed.” He waved a hand imperiously.
Knowing he had been instrumental in releasing the Darkness made Castiel wish he could have all his memories wiped again. The final kick in the teeth was realizing he had allowed Lucifer to ride his vessel out of Hell and wreak havoc for no reason at all. If Lucifer had been crucial to stopping Amara, he could have justified being so reckless. Instead, he felt like the biggest moron in the history of the Universe.
“Father has never been ‘fair’; humans invented that idea. The real difference between you and me is that when your father disappeared, your brother sought your help,” Lucifer explained, “Mine left me to rot.”
Faith emerged after a short wait, with Castiel a few steps behind. Jane noticed the way he halted suddenly when he realized she was nearby. The fear which flitted across his features was easily recognisable and she did not like it.
“I tried that once,” Gabriel revealed, “Not my style. Castiel, are we moving you into Dean? I must say, everyone who sees you two gazing at each other assumes you’ve been in him at some stage.”
Dean sighed as he realized how significant the request was. He did not want to get that close to Lucifer, even if he was an observer rather than a participant.
Dean was struck by a disturbing thought, “So, when I said they were beautiful, I was complementing your junk? Damn, Gabby will never let me live that down.”
Gabriel ushered Meg toward the table in the library. Sam was thinking so loudly, the Archangel was surprised the mortals couldn’t hear it.
She suspected the two Hunters would be more reasonable and was oddly relieved that their grandfather was not involved in her imprisonment.
“Dean, you consider Castiel to be family. For me, it’s literal; of course, I helped my brother,” Gabriel resisted the urge to refer to Dean as a mud-monkey for thinking he wouldn’t help Castiel.
“I wouldn’t let him do that,” Gabriel assured her, “Sam needs to be loved; it’s his biggest weakness. Relax and let it happen.”
“Did you find anything interesting in Dean’s head?” Meg asked Castiel as she stretched out her arms along the back of the couch.
“But where does it end?” Sam asked worriedly, “Humans have explored Eugenics and it led to the rise of the Nazis. The concern is not where it starts, but where it could lead.”
“Is this your version of torture?” Lucifer wondered, “Drag me down to the level of you apes by talking about my ‘feelings’?”
“That sounds like a great idea,” Faith mused. She pulled Sam into a kiss. She was silently appreciating shoulder-length hair on a man for providing a convenient grip when Dean interrupted.
Castiel stared at the Hunter and his wings trembled. Heavy seconds passed before he found his voice, “Dean, I know how traumatising it was being pressured to be Michael’s vessel. I couldn’t do that to you.”
Sam couldn’t see what Matthias was doing behind Cas. Dean had a slightly better view, so he spotted the new instrument of torture she pulled out of nowhere.
Gabriel opened his eyes to see Chuck looming over him. Memories of being held captive, tortured and dying flooded back into his mind.
“Not exactly; there are a few categories of humans I plan to eliminate, but the vast majority will just be sterilised.”
Faith had trouble reconciling this new knowledge with the non-threatening man who regarded her with worried eyes.
“You’re just as cursed, no matter what the name,” Gabriel said dismissively, “Samandriel is your Guardian Angel, so be nice. Dean stabbed his Angel before he knew his name.”
“Those tattered rags you were wearing?” Gabriel teased, “I burned them. The smell alone was enough to warrant it.”
The phone call to Kevin took longer than the meal; the Prophet was reluctant to move. Dean finally convinced him to let Gabriel move him and all his research to the bunker if his mother was taken there first.
“Many of our viewers have questioned your steps to take away their right to have children,” the interviewer managed, “Do you have any statement to give regarding their concerns?”
“Compared to most Angels, he was a comedian,” Samandriel recalled, “I’m not sure how he avoided Naomi’s drill.”
Gabriel returned to the gathering with a determined expression and immediately conjured a table weighted down by the sheer quantity of alcohol. The previous supply looked quite paltry by comparison.
Gabriel sensed Balthazar’s Grace reach toward him tentatively. He could feel how neglected the younger Angel was, and it made him frown.
“Being possessed by an Angel is different for each vessel, depending on what is comfortable for the Angel. Most vessels are locked away in a loop of pleasant memories to keep them content.”
Castiel wasn’t sure why he was filled with a smug pride when Dean appreciated his wings. Logically, he should have been uncomfortable with the reminder that Dean could still see them.
“Could you have gone back further?” Dean asked thoughtfully, “To stop Sam dying so I didn’t go to Hell in the first place?”
Gabriel provided a simple meal for dinner, sensing that those who needed to eat were too nervous for anything more elaborate.
“Dean has always called me an overly-emotional sap,” Sam said to Lucifer, “Try talking about what you’re feeling; even if you don’t understand why you’re acting weird.”
“I wanted to ask you why you ripped out a couple of pages from this book?” Faith asked directly, while holding up the book on Dhampirs.
“Yet, I do regret Sam’s suffering; even when I was trying to protect him,” Lucifer continued, “Why do I regret hurting Sam, when I hurt others so much more?”
“I could, but Castiel needs to learn how to cope from you. If he is first bitten, he will take great care to control the thirst when he is driving your body,” Gabriel explained.
Castiel nuzzled into the Hunter’s collarbone and savoured his scent. He could feel the bond between them edging further into the territory of a telepathic link and she welcomed the new type of intimacy.
Michael felt Dean begin to rise from his sleep cycle, “Dean will wake soon. Father wants you to bond to him completely; if he resembles a Nephilim, I will offer my protection.”
“Looks like someone needs a nap,” Gabriel said condescendingly, “Don’t worry Deano, we’ll take care of the witch.”
“Give us time,” Gabriel joked, “Castiel was definitely corrupted by the Winchesters; it took months.”
Dean went first, using both hands to shine the flashlight and point his gun simultaneously. Sam suspected they would find the remains of the creature but feared she would be close to death and still suffering.
“Castiel?” Faith repeated worriedly. She caught his forearm in one hand to help him recognise reality.
Gabriel was still glaring at the weary man, “You’re planning to suffer every second of a human lifespan because you feel guilty? You had no choice but to kill Raphael; I wish I had been there to give you another option than Purgatory.”
Gabriel watched as Michael and Lucifer rose from the hole in the ground, their true forms lighting up the cemetery as the sun set.
“He calls it ‘tolerable’,” Dean laughed, “I’m not ever going to try pineapple pizza; if he likes it, I’ll never speak to him again.”
Gabriel held out his hand, “Your power is impressive. If you hold my hand, I should be able to transport you to the bunker.”
“I offered Sam my Grace,” Lucifer said as he pulled out a random chair and sat down, “You probably need to assure him that it doesn’t carry Devil-cooties.”
Gabriel knew why Crowley was being so cooperative; his humiliation at the hands of Lucifer hurt more than any weapon possibly could. The Demon would die rather than live through that again.
“You can’t see it, but her wings are fluffed up because she’s so happy,” Gabriel continued, “It’s downright adorable.”
Gabriel reached out to touch Castiel’s arm, “A few hours, most likely. I won’t leave until he is back on his feet.”
Castiel regretted the fact that he hadn’t been allowed to remove more of Dean’s memories of Hell at the time. After years of living with them, they were too deeply embedded in his psyche to be erased.
He was unable to stop beating Dean into a bloody pulp over the Angel tablet, or to stop Metatron pining him down and slitting his throat to extract his Grace.
“There’s not much you can do about it,” Gabriel reasoned, “Especially if you go back to create another parallel reality.”
“Does anyone else know how dark your wings are, Castiel? Wings are very personal to Angels,” Matthias continued, addressing the humans, “We rarely even show them to each other in Heaven.”
“Or back to before the civil war in Heaven?” Castiel asked, “You could go toe-to-toe with Raphael and avoid Leviathans and Purgatory.”
Faith fell asleep easily with an Angel guiding the process. She had encouraged Castiel to explore her memories, with the condition that he assess the emotions associated with each scenario. If any sort of unease was present, he was not allowed to speak of what he had seen without consulting her first.
Dean lunged forward, intent on causing damage to the smirking Archangel. A hand on his chest slammed him back against the bed. Dean glared across as Cas, who kept his restraining hand in place.
Gabriel tapped his fingers together like Mr Burns from the Simpsons, “A Trickster always has a plan.”
While Adam ate the lunch that Gabriel provided, Chuck explained that across the world, communities which existed in harmony with nature were being guarded by Angels. They had significantly higher proportions of fertile people and were in danger of being exploited by others.
A sad smile was all he could conjure for his rejoicing siblings. He had accepted the flaws in his own Father and His plans before the Cage slammed shut. The rest of the Angels still assumed God was perfect; he envied and pitied them at the same time.
Faith pulled Castiel’s limp form away from the Archangel. Jane stretched her hand out palm-first while her eyes glowed.
“And yet, when I’m sad and need a hug, no-one wants to swoop in to comfort me,” Gabriel complained, “He’s like a puppy in a trench-coat.”
? You never extended these ‘rights’ to other primates, so why would Angels be expected to acknowledge them?”
Castiel’s expressions turned contemptuous, “That’s the only reason you won’t kill me?” she summarised, “No wonder Heaven fell into decay under your leadership.”
“No; the changes are not that complete; Father didn’t give me a uterus,” Castiel explained, “Considering how painful birth is, I’m relieved it can’t happen.”
“The pants and blouse are acceptable,” Castiel admitted, “But I can’t fathom how this could be comfortable.”
Gabriel held up his hands in mock surrender and backed away a few steps. The grin on his face was as smug as ever.
“Their powers are suppressed, thanks to Doofus and Boofhead,” Gabriel explained, “Mike and Luci won’t stop
“I’m not drunk enough for this conversation,” Sam declared, “When can you ward this place against uninvited Angels?”
“You took on my pain and spent a year in Purgatory as penance. You tried your best,” Sam argued, “I chose to jump in the Cage and Lucifer chose to torture me between bouts with Michael before you pulled my body out. We are all culpable, and I don’t hold a grudge against you. I’m not sure about Lucifer, yet.”
“You know, Castiel, I believe you about the key to those handcuffs,” Matthias said, “You were always a terrible liar.”
“I can, and I have,” Castiel said flatly, “Only the truly evil will be killed and Angels will look after the rest.”
Sam didn’t realize why one hand released his shoulder until he felt a gentle pressure against his groin. He moaned into her hair and was struck by a petty thought.
“Keep in touch,” Dean urged, “If you pray directly to Castiel, Michael or Gabriel, we’re not far away.”
“Bullshit,” Gabriel scoffed, “It’s all about motive; he was throwing a tantrum whereas you prevented another Apocalypse. If Chuck wanted any of them to live, he would have resurrected them.”
Faith tilted her head and stared at the wall while she conferred with Castiel, “He’s struggling to describe it. The closest approximation would be telepathic rape.”
“I’ll watch over you when you sleep,” Gabriel offered, “Did you use your powers to sooth Sam and Dean?”
“This is new,” Dean noted with a cocky grin as Cas settled on his thighs, leaving enough room between their bodies to make eye contact.
“Demon blood,” Sam continued, “I was tainted with it as a baby, and addicted to it a few years back.”
“I considered leaving the moment Faith mentioned you,” Jane admitted, “But that photo made me curious. You called him Metatron?” She held the picture in her hand.
Jane wanted to help, but she was the third wheel. She could see the tendrils of their souls wrapping together neatly in a glowing dance invisible to mortals.
Sam let out an odd sound somewhere between a yelp and a grunt. The pain was not as bad as he anticipated, and he was surprised by the tingle of pleasure spreading through his body.
Gabriel instructed the two of them to hold hands. He touched his fingers to their foreheads and allowed his Grace to form a bridge between their souls. Moments later, their souls surged forward to meld together.
Castiel had long ago accepted that watching Dean sleep unnerved the man. He was sure it was linked to the vulnerability of being unconscious, combined with the knowledge of the dangerous creatures in the world.
“Cas is driving, not your girlfriend,” Dean said quickly. He had seen the annoyed look the taller brother wore for an instant, before he realized who was in control.
“And compromised loyalty and terrible judgement,” she added, “Theoretically, if Dean were to accept the bond with Castiel, his wings would stop darkening. No human has ever accepted a full bond with an Angel, so he is doomed. When they all turn black; he will die. Based on the black feathers down there, you have less than ten years to live, Castiel. Your vessel is already aging, isn’t it? Soon, you won’t be able to hide the wrinkles around your eyes and even your human pets will notice.”
Sam could discern that Cas was in control due to the facial expressions alone. Rather than the shy smile Faith would greet him with, a passive Cas regarded him with mind interest.
3 – If you spot a typo, feel free to message me so I can fix it. I proofread as much as possible, but I’m not perfect.
Castiel slipped one hand behind Dean’s neck. “Yes. It is getting stronger, but the bond has existed since I marked your soul.”
“You’ve already made a huge difference,” Dean assured him, “Just the thoughts of turning Demon creeps me out, so thank-you for preventing that.”
Faith approached the café with a racing heart. When Gabriel had outlined the plan, it had seemed straightforward. Now, she was sure she was going to die.
The Archangel folded his arms over his chest, “Fine; there was an account about ‘Loki’ using a Dhampir to mess with some people. It was not my best year, alright?”
“We’ll make it a deal,” Gabriel suggested, “If Crowley wants the tablet, he has to release Bobby Singer from Hell.”
Lucifer unfolded his body and fell to one side, reminding Gabriel of a child throwing a tantrum on the floor, “Michael is unreasonable; nobody but Father could change his mind about the Apocalypse.”
Castiel enjoyed seeing Dean smile and hearing him laugh was even better His memory of the visit to the den of iniquity was dominated by Dean’s amusement as they escaped.
Faith gripped his shoulders tightly and moved slowly so he had time to pull away. She was immensely relieved when he allowed her close enough to run the tip of her tongue over the skin she wanted to mark.
Gabriel waited until Dean disappeared down the hall to giggle and announce, “Captain Cockblock strikes again.”
Castiel was blushing and Dean could hear the uncertainty in her voice. He expected her to speak of orgies, or something equally taboo.
“As you can see his wings already, your eyes probably won’t explode during the transfer,” Gabriel said seriously.
“Good,” Gabriel decided, “The three of them seem to attract trouble; the need a woman to smack them on the head when they do something stupid.”
Michael regarded Gabriel with confusion. Gabriel sighed and pulled the taller man into a hug. After a few moments, Michael patted his back tentatively.
“I didn’t anticipate that from Dean’s soul,” Chuck agreed, “That’s what I love about humanity; they are full of surprises.”
He recognised Faith’s voice and was oddly relieved. He did not want Dean or Sam to see him while he felt so awful. He did not want to face either brother until he absolutely had to, because they also knew what he had done.
Gabriel chuckled aloud, knowing he could never reveal that the ‘denim-wrapped nightmares’ unnerved Crowley to the point of paranoia. After thoroughly annoying Dean and Castiel, he bid the Archangel farewell.
Dean was not surprised when Michael used that exact phrase. Internally, he laughed hard at the dumbfounded expressions following Michael’s apology.
By the time Gabriel returned to the bunker, Lucifer was stretched out on the couch, staring at the ceiling.
Dean was horrified in a way he had not experienced since his time in Hell. He had watched Castiel carve into his own chest with a box-cutter without flinching. Seeing him shaking and hearing him scream in agony was deeply disturbing. Blood streamed down from the wounds and dripped onto the floor.
“I have witnessed much of that,” Castiel agreed, “Though there was a lot of ridiculous behaviour from sensible people once alcohol was involved.”
With a shy smile, Dean joined the edge of the odd assortment of limbs sprawled together. He was careful to keep his hands to himself, which was difficult as Samandriel was unwilling to relinquish his hold on Castiel.
Dean glared at her and Castiel replied, “I am unsure how rabbits’ mate, but Dean and I do not engage in copulation.”
“A member was relocated to observe the child. His son went out with her and reported back when she began avoiding direct sunlight and craving blood,” Sam continued, “She bit her fiancée during, uh, you know -”
“I have your two pet humans, Castiel. If you want Sam to live, you will exit your warded hideout in the next five minutes. Come alone. I have a Reaper here, ready to shove their souls into the Empty if you resist.”
“Dean, there is no way to predict how the Grace in you would affect us,” Castiel warned, his eyes still fixed on the wall.
“Gabriel thinks chocolate helps during difficult situations,” Castiel said, holding out a large box of chocolate.
“You will not!” Dean insisted. He backed away a few steps, as though he could distance himself from how uncomfortable he felt.
