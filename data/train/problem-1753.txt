Sherlock was sitting on the floor in the back of one of the ambulances and had some ridiculous orange emergency blanket draped over his shoulders.
"Dr John Watson?"
Mrs Hudson scurried around the flat, putting something in its place here, tidying something up there, when she finally held the daily paper in her hand.
Eventually.
That was exactly how I would have done it. To learn what I wanted to learn, any means would have served me. In that respect, I was almost a little proud of Sherlock and found that I was beginning to think of him a little as my pupil.
She switched to shy, insecure pathologist Molly Hooper in seconds.
"Yes, John. She must have something to do with Moriarty."
He would turn to him.
Sherlock furrowed his brow.
He would have to do something.
Heads would roll, literally.
I shrugged.
He, however, was struck by the fact that he had obviously hurt Molly and it mattered to him what I, John Watson, thought about him ... he had more heart than some who prided themselves on their sentimentality. Pah. And that's what made him so weak.
Would the whole thing finally, here and now, come to an end?
"Good evening, my darling!"
A moment later, however, I heard from him a little softer:
But Sherlock was silent too.
"No John. I really said that."
On the side sliding door I had the inscription: "Owner J. Bifrons". I had to grin at the thought.
So I called Sarah and told her I couldn't come.
Actually, there was only one possibility: I had to die.
But the fact that he was now apparently starting to prepare the tea unconsciously so that his head could believe that "Sherlock" had done it, that was going too far. After all, that would not be entirely safe, apart from anything else, just think of boiling water and the like. And what would come next?
Sherlock looked a little smug and John couldn't help but grin.
His knees were shaking, his voice failing.
"Look, I know I'm not the ideal flatmate. Physically battered and traumatised ... had some unpleasant experiences in Afghanistan and now I have nightmares, flashbacks and ...  So if you don't want to put your acquaintance through that, then I should probably go now."
"John, I thought you would have known. Sherlock didn't jump to his death from the roof of the Bart. I was helping him. It was an act."
"Do you mind if I come up, Dr Watson? I'd like a few words with my brother.“
"John ..." he moaned, because he was tied to the bed and I held the fruit just so that his lips were millimetres away from it, but he couldn't get hold of it.
No sooner said than done, and through her tears Molly sobbed:
Okay Moriarty, now we need to mentally sort out what is happening here, I thought as Angelo babbled at me. He told me how Sherlock had saved him from a long prison sentence.
"One new message ..." he said, opening the message.
He was handling a pipette and he was ... impressive.
"Well, Sherlock's business seems to be booming, Dr Watson, since you both are .... well ... buddies."
The answer he then gave was amazingly accurate.
One word, however, drilled into her brain:
Things were not going as expected.
This was a wonderful instrument to play with Sherlock.
Yes, Sherlock wouldn't have wanted him to take it so easy and end the fight.
Nothing could really have forced him to take that capsule. It was clear by now that the taxi man's weapon was only a lighter. And he himself would have ... well, Sherlock would be able to incapacitate him with a single blow.
So he took white bread from the cupboard, ham, tomato sandwich cream from the fridge and began to make sandwiches the way Sherlock had always liked best. If he had ever eaten them at all. And while he prepared two sandwiches, one for himself and one for "Sherlock", he realised that he was really hungry. When was the last time he had eaten a meal with appetite? Well, before Sherlock's death, actually.
"Yes, John."
"Mickey Clifton," the ID card said. A few phone calls later through Lestrade, and they knew he was the owner of the Cat's Paradise pet shop.
"My 'death' became known in the criminal circles. Outside the network, only Mycroft might have known. And he, of course, was the only one who knew that I had, in fact, survived it."
Most people who deal with me think it means Jim. That's not entirely wrong, since Jim is a nickname from my youth. I like it, so I kept it.
But it was annoying to gradually lose and restore contacts that had been built up over a long period of time.
I was just realising that at this moment.
"You mean it? I thought their different needs were the reason..."
Well, that's true. I'm not gay, I'm bisexual. Nonetheless, I realize that I implied that I wasn't interested in men by saying that.
“I knew you wouldn’t intentionally hurt me.” Sherlock stirs his soup, the noodles catching on his chopsticks. “I saw your caring nature and thought it’d be safer here for the time being.”
“Sounds like you have a problem on your hands.” John looks up and catches Sherlock’s eyes.
“Er, go back to sleep, I’ll be quiet now. I, er, need to email my teacher, anyway. Reschedule the test.”
Only after an unknown number of minutes crawl by does John even consider doing what the doctor suggested.
“Are you going to force me to make up a name?”
The sound the junkie makes sounds too much like a sob. John doesn’t like it.
“What would you like?” John asks as he checks Sherlock’s pupil dilation.
The chairs are never comfortable in hospitals. They're always hard and plastic or poorly cushioned and too small. It's a horrible design error. The people sitting in these chairs are already miserable, why add to their discomfort?
John pulls out his phone and sends a text to Sherlock. For some reason, he might not be able to hear John’s yells, and John will use every available avenue he has to
“How disgraceful! Were you even paying attention to what you were doing?!”
John sets both bowls on the stool next to the couch and goes back into his room.
“I don’t want to sit down.”
The stranger’s weight shifts-
Sherlock seems to collapse in on himself, his shoulders hunching even further, his head hanging. He feels the sudden urge to just lay down and stay there. He drops to his knees instead, exhausted.
Every time he had checked on Sherlock in the night, he had been awake and irritable, desperately wanting to sleep but unable. A pang went through John’s chest every time he saw those tired, red eyes.
“I’d do anything for you John, surely you must know that by now.”
Is he sleeping? John’s confident that Sherlock’s going to sleep most of the day away going by how he acted the night before and that morning. But...with no one there to wake him how will John know that he hasn’t slipped into a coma? He didn’t get a CT scan, there’s no other way of knowing if there was any severe brain damage.
“Take your clothes off.”
They’ve hardly been apart from each other for more than a handful of hours, John rushing to get back home whenever he has a spare minute.
“He loves you, yes?”
Sherlock's hands stay on John's back, rubbing up and down soothingly.
Eventually, he finds the break room with the old and over-used coffee machine. A dwindling tower of paper cups sits on the counter next to it, in need of being re-stocked.
The door opens a few inches, hiding Sherlock from view. “Bring me your dressing gown.”
He curls further in on himself, his back protesting at the strenuous angle.
“You’re very obviously a medical student—second or third year I’d guess from the textbooks you have lying around—and the ‘advice’ you have given me suggests that you are well-acquainted with what is and isn’t a concern regarding head injuries. I haven’t seen you look up any new information so it is safe to assume you knew all of it beforehand. The café you work at—I saw you through the windows behind the counter—is a common haunt for students from Bart’s because of its close location. Your hands are also dry in a way that is consistent with constant washing, which a medical student would obviously be doing after all those
John blinks. “Because you need to eat to gain energy to help you heal. And you’re more likely to eat if it’s something you like.”
“Hour ‘till close,” Mike answers.
"I'll be right there," Sherlock says again.
He immediately closes his eyes and starts to lay down.
Taking pity on him, John helps removes the rest of the dressing gown from his frame, letting his hands skim across Sherlock’s warm skin. Once it’s off, Sherlock flips onto his stomach, his head pillowed on his hands. John leaves the dressing gown to pool over Sherlock’s bum, protecting his decency.
John barely hears the soft “Marvelous” coming from the living room.
“Yes. I know.”
on you-”
The arm around John's shoulder disappears. John steps aside, but close enough to assist if needed.
Sherlock just rolls his eyes and goes back to his soup.
“Sherlock?”
Their hands are still clasped and it isn’t until that moment does John realise he had been swiping his thumb back and forth across Sherlock’s knuckles. He stops but doesn’t pull away.
Sherlock now realises, as he and John sit next to each other, why Ella replaced the single chair for a sofa. How long has she been planning this?
Sherlock's silence is filled with words, words he no doubt wants to voice. He chooses none.
After a painful flirting failure with Anthea, John unlocks the door to his bedsit and braces himself to find his home robbed or empty.
“Sherlock?” John’s voice seems to tremble with Sherlock’s body.
“That is no excuse! Do you know how much–!”
Unknown number. The phone continues to vibrate in John’s hand while he considers answering, but it goes to voicemail before he can decide.
Sherlock recoils with an “Ng!”
Sherlock responds by nudging his feet closer. John sighs.
“I know, but if you’ve made these decisions,” John gestures to the mangled, vulnerable insides of Sherlock’s elbows hidden beneath his hoodie, “then I’m not taking any risks with assuming you know how to take care of yourself.”
Sherlock’s voice cracks. “Please-come get me.”
A chorus of
“Don’t stop.” He sounds almost accusatory, and John smiles.
Sherlock stands and John squeezes his hand once before letting go.
"Sherlock," John answers, glancing at the phone in his hand. He taps the end call button, pocketing it.
“I-I’m sorry. It was nothing.”
He flips the cap open and squirts a dollop onto his palm.
Before Sherlock can say anything, John jumps to the side and away from the bed, flinging the duvet off, and sneaking his arms underneath Sherlock’s knees and shoulders.
He hears Sherlock turn towards him in surprise.
Sherlock looks as if he’s about to protest, but John holds up a hand to stop him.
His hand finds its way into his pocket, grasping his mobile.
Sherlock sees John’s shadow moving towards him and raises his head.
A junkie in need of his next fix, reduced to thievery for money. John feels regret and shame that he kissed him, was planning on sleeping with him.
John almost doesn’t go to class that day.
The moment feels comfortable. John doesn’t remember the last time he felt so content.
The junkie has one of the couch’s pillows under his head. He winces when the old threadbare fabric rubs against the scrapes on his cheek.
The world is quiet save for the sound of their breathing and skin on skin.
“John…”
“Any good?”
But when he arrives back home, he finds Sherlock on the couch wrapped in a blanket, trembling.
The silence is deafening.
John can’t help the smile that sneaks onto his face, turning away and hiding it behind his hand.
The final camera swivels away as John watches, fear and excitement running through him. “How are you doing this?”
They stay that way for a long moment, Sherlock wriggling his toes and picking at the sleeve of his borrowed sweatshirt, John silently turning the pages of the textbook as he reads.
Ignoring the slight completely, John asks “So, who is he? The man in the suit?”
Aziraphale’s eyes follow his movement, and John can see the obvious love and affection in them for the other man. He has a smile on his face, and John can almost believe he sees tears.
“...Soup. Maybe.”
"Stand up."
“Come on, up you get.” John drags him upright, his arms under his armpits. “You can at least help a little you know, I know you're not
Sherlock scoffs. “Are we really doing this right now?”
“Yeeeees,” John smiles.
“You didn’t go.”
“You...you had a test today. I remember you studying for it.” Sherlock’s words are muffled.
Sherlock takes a large breath to clam himself, exhaling after a few long seconds.
"What is it?" John bites back, distantly aware that his reaction is unprecedented and unfair, but doesn't stop to apologise or feel sorry.
John raises his hand to place on Sherlock’s shoulder, but he hesitates, his hand stuttering halfway. It falls back to his side.
he learned about in Art History.
“I thought you didn’t want to talk to me.”
The noise sounds doubled, like there are two sets of the same running pair of legs slightly off set from each other in duration.
Buzzing and beeping ring along the line, going for much longer than expected. He almost gives it up as a lost cause when he hears a click, and a concerned, "John?"
are flying every which way. They look incredibly soft and delicate, begging someone to run their fingers through them.
Sherlock’s lack of a sarcastic response tells John more than he needs to know.
John then flips Sherlock’s hand over and uses both of his own to massage the bony top of Sherlock’s hand, paying special attention to the meaty portion of his thumb and each interdigital fold.
John doesn’t touch it.
“Did he offer you money to spy on me?” Sherlock suddenly demands, not answering John’s question.
John stands and walks to the bedroom, pulling his shirt off on the way. He pretends to not notice Sherlock watching him.
Sherlock works his jaw for a moment before opening again. John grabs a hold of his jaw, facial hair rasping against his fingers, and sticks the thermometer in.
“That’s...wow,” John exhales. “Is that a thing you can do? It’s like what you did last night; how–how do you do that?”
It certainly isn’t appropriate, but Sherlock wouldn’t mind.
John feels his mobile vibrate in his pocket, distracting him from his driving.
A low moan leaves the man’s mouth, much more grouchy, but more alert, than the previous times John woke him in the night.
He didn’t know muscle aches and chills could get this bad.
The shirt is too short on Sherlock, showing a tiny sliver of stomach—too concave, needs to eat more—and the sleeves too tight. It can’t be comfortable for him.
"I can do it myself."
“Please,” Sherlock says, desperate, his voice cracking.
He accepts the call, dreading what he’s going to hear.
incapacitated.”
Sherlock looks scandalized. “Why would I know that? Why are you asking?”
The man takes it, his plump lips wrapping around the ice. It looks obscene, and John has to force himself to look away.
,” he commands.
“I want you to have this,” Harry says as she slides her mobile across the sticky café table.
John sighs and his shoulders sag.
help! You know what drinking did to Mom and Dad and I can’t believe you would do that to yourself! To me!”
The tension in the air could be cut with a knife.
John doesn’t speak, his jaw clenched and eyes hard.
He tries to sit up again.
John doesn’t remember going to him, but the next thing he knows he’s vigorously rubbing his hands up down Sherlock’s arms, desperate to warm him up.
Silence. John swallows. Is he…?
The pupil in his right eye doesn’t retract as fast as the left. John tutts as the man squints into the light. He clicks the penlight off, his patient sighing in relief.
Checking for fever, I’m sure.
“He doesn’t…feel things like that.”
Coming with nary a noise, save for a stuttered and quiet ‘John’, Sherlock clings to him to prevent himself from falling limp onto the pillows beneath him. His face pressed into John’s shoulder, John’s hands soothing all over his overheated body.
“Now, tell me more about this partner of yours.”
How dare John not convey to Sherlock just how much he loves this man? What has John been doing that could
Who knows how long this man has lived on the streets, or the last time he ate. He’s dehydrated and malnourished, and John’s caring nature screams at him to fix it.
“Too bad for her.” Mrs. Hudson turns toward a nearly-paralyzed John. “I was going to offer her a free pastry.”
“Mm, yes.”
John can feel the terror radiating off him, his eyes wide in fear.
John drops his bag by the door and rushes to his side.
John doesn't even try to make it to his classes that day. He spends the day in his bedsit lying on the couch because he can't stand the idea of lying in the bed he and Sherlock had shared the night before.
The warmth of the stranger is torn away from him in an instant, between one breath and the next.
“Hey,” John says as he lightly taps the man’s uninjured cheek. “Stay awake for me, mate.”
Sherlock holds a hand palm-up, accepting the pill and popping it into his mouth in one smooth motion. “Thank you.”
“…Yes. I do.”
“I–um, here,” John stutters, walking across the room and putting the bag on the floor in front of the sofa. “Your clothes. They’re clean now.”
“It would be my pleasure.”
John finds Sherlock curled into a tight ball, breathing heaving and shivering, staring at nothing.
"John?"
“I’m almost there, love, I’ll be there in a minute.”
Dabbing at the welling blood, John says, “You shouldn't have tried to steal from me.”
Before he can change his mind, John sits at the edge of the bed and wraps his arms around Sherlock, resting his forehead against the jut of Sherlock’s shoulder. Not squeezing, just offering the comfort of his touch.
“Er,” John starts. “Obviously not good, but not as bad as I feared. Your pupils are reacting more evenly now, and the lump on your head tells me that there’s no skull fracture. I wish you’d let me get you a CT scan but…You need fluids and rest,” he finishes.
John huffs out a sigh.
For the next forty-five minutes, John examines his memories, almost doubting the whole encounter. He glances at the car, thinking he might have imagined Anthea and that she really isn’t behind those tinted windows. That the car is actually a posh taxi service.
John recognizes his voice from the ominous phone call. He looks how he sounds.
“Apologizes for not introducing myself earlier, I’m Aziraphale and this is Crowley,” he gestures to himself then his partner.
John pushes on Sherlock’s shoulder to roll him over. Sherlock groans.
"I don't have to deal with her anymore."
“I could be wrong, but I
John rips it from her hand none too gently and stalks out of the café as quickly as he can manage.
John straightens up, dismissing the comment. “You wouldn’t know when I was supposed to be back, you can’t know if I was ‘late.’”
“Met a friend of yours.”
John’s heart races and he doesn’t know why.
Once he's back in England, John’s told he has to see a therapist. Supposedly, it’s to help him integrate back into civilian life. That night, after his first session with Ella Thompson where she tells him to keep a blog that John knows will stay empty, he doesn’t throw anything, even though he wants to.
“Is your jaw hurting?” John worries.
He finds a tallish man in a tan waistcoat and white overcoat standing off to the side of him. An even taller, slender man in sunglasses stands at his side with his hand in the other’s elbow.
“Why did you call me.” John’s voice is low.
“Oh, don’t be like that, practically everyone is.”
Not one person mentions his limp.
” the apparition says again. But…it lacks the echo of his hallucinations. This voice is solid and most definitely real.
“Well, thank god you’re above all that,” John says, pointedly looking around the warehouse.
John lets out a chuckle, enjoying riling up Sherlock and getting him out of his dark mood. “I gotta go. I’ll Skype at, say, six? When the last presentation is over for the day?”
“Hmph.”
“Any point in asking where I’m going?”
“I’ll see what I have.”
All he sees are people walking along the sidewalk, going about their day, completely unaware that John is well on his way toward[s] an emotional breakdown.
Sherlock lets out a satisfied sigh, and John can’t help but notice how certain parts of his anatomy react to that sound.
“No, I need Sherlock where is he,” John pleas as he follows the woman into the restaurant, no doubt looking out of place and raggedy with his sweat-covered brow and agitated movements.
John scrambles to retrieve his wallet from the ground before the junkie wakes, his palms scraping against the pavement in his hurry.
Sherlock reluctantly downs the paracetamol with water John gives him, the movement obviously paining him.
The phone’s notification is alarmingly loud in the silent room, nothing other than the breathing from the two men in the bed. They were tangled up in each other, but had drifted apart during the night.
“I can’t lose him again.”
“I’d be non-combatant.”
Nearly every day, it seems that Sherlock develops a new symptom. Muscle aches, tremors, chills. Nightmares and the occasional fever. It’s getting increasingly harder for John to convince himself to leave the bedsit for class and work.
But he deserves so much more than John has to offer.
John places a hand on his shoulder. "Sit up or I’m taking you to A&E."
“John?”
John stands and looks out the glass front of the building. He finds a CCTV camera at the top corner of the building across the street and to the left. “Yeah, I see it.”
“Yes.”
“Mm.”
“It is as he says.”
John grabs his mobile to find a text from Mike:
“Just to the hospital.” Pulling the man's arm, John takes the man's weight against his chest as he trips forward.
“…Have you bought a ring?”
“Headache.”
“I need to check your eyes.”
John stands there for much longer than he’d like to admit, and I won’t intrude on his privacy by telling you, either.
Sherlock starts again, softer. “I am human. I have emotions, I have feelings. I…I don’t know how to handle them and I need
When John’s phone rings for the upteenth time that night, he almost doesn’t notice dawn breaking.
Mrs. Hudson creeps up the stairs, her hip preventing her from moving as fast as she used to. She balances a plate of biscuits on her hand, watching her step so not a single one falls.
Ella looks at Sherlock knowingly and walks back into her office, John and Sherlock following.
John doesn’t mention the pockmarks in the man’s elbows. He doesn’t mention that without his access to drugs that he’ll go into withdrawal in he didn’t know how many days. He doesn’t mention that it would be worse with a concussion.
As he’s making coffee and tea, he thinks about how Sherlock was unable to eat his breakfast and how he must be starving.
“An enemy.”
On second thought, probably not the best thing to say to the stranger John roughed up not even 24 hours prior.
“God!” he grits out.  His muscles are tense.
Is Sherlock is getting worse? What if John can’t help him? Will Sherlock become so desperate to end the withdrawal that he leaves to score another hit?
“Interested in Sherlock, why? I’m guessing you’re not friends.”
“Did you eat anything other than crackers?” John returns, sitting on the ottoman opposite the sofa.
He doesn't say anything as John drags him down the hall and plops him onto his bed. John isn't sure that his compliance is a good or bad sign.
Sherlock's voice comes through the small speakers on John's mobile, almost tinny in sound. "John? What is it, what's wrong? John?"
Sherlock had suspected, of course, but he didn’t want to believe it. Didn’t want John to be hurt, and didn’t want to get his own hopes up.
By the time John checks on him in the morning, he’s finally fallen asleep.
John’s response comes out rushed. “No, I’m not, I’m just not interested. Are we done?”
Sherlock shoots John an offended glare.
That night, John goes to sleep thinking about how he desperately wishes he wasn’t sleeping on the couch.
The man stares at John. “You tell me.”
John pulls his legs onto the bed and swings one over Sherlock’s hip, reminiscent of their first meeting. He feels properly guilty, now. For hurting Sherlock the way he did.
John had been looking forward to collapsing into their bed as soon as they apprehended the culprit (surprisingly easy after how long it took to solve) and sleep in as late as he pleased with his beloved pressed against his chest.
The sounds of fabric rustling and Lestrade's gruff voice yelling in the background dimly permeates John's thoughts. Sherlock's left a crime scene for him.
“Hm. Yeah.” John starts to rub his hands down Sherlock’s back, kneading the muscles.
~/|\~
“Let me get changed,” John says softly.
“Dr. Watson, it’s time for your appointment.”
Sherlock takes a deep breath and sighs, the air cascading over John's knuckles. Gooseflesh travels from his hands to his arms.
John curses himself.
“It’s fascinating.”
“You don’t seem very frightening.”
"Mm."
Hesitantly, John relinquishes his hold. The junkie stays still, too still.
John doesn't hear her walk away, but when he finally sits up, slowly, he doesn't see her nor anyone else nearby.
“Well, I’m glad you did,” John says. “I would have worried ceaselessly otherwise.”
Is he eating? God, John hopes he’s eating. There isn’t much in the kitchen, but surely there’s more than what was on the streets.
"You're going to need to sit up for me," John says as he moves to stand in front of the couch. "Come on." He pulls a chair up to the edge of the sofa and sits.
John composes his email to Mr. Pardue in mortification.
Slowly, as if approaching an injured animal, John reaches for the stranger again. “I'm not going to hurt you, I just want to take you to the hospital.”
“Fine, fine.” Sherlock plops back down on the bed, his chest still heaving.
Sherlock responds by blowing his nose. “That’s not...what people normally say,” he says, his voice nasally and weak.
John takes the top two and fills them automatically, plopping two sugars into one and leaving the other black.
Sherlock raises his hands to hold onto John’s wrists, keeping him in place and preventing him from moving further away.
“Yes,” Sherlock whispers.
John frowns. All he smells is smoke. “Don’t smoke in my flat.”
More rustling, and Sherlock knows both John and Greg are looking at him, searching for signs of wakefulness.
“Up you get!” John stands. “I’m still not having you sleep on the sofa with a concussion.” He holds out a hand for Sherlock to take, but he opts instead to slowly raise himself to a sitting position.
The man gives a short laugh. “You are brave, aren’t you? Bravery is by far the kindest word for stupidity, don’t you think?” His expression turns in a second. “What is your connection to Sherlock,” he demands.
Finally, John arrives, not caring to find a spot inside the parking lot, instead killing the engine as soon as he drives onto the property.
“Sounds perfect,” John says, a smile evident in his voice.
“Hey, John!” Mike’s voice calls out.
“Well, I have to call you something, don't I?”
When the coffee steam rises up into his face, he thinks about Sherlock slipping or fainting in the shower, falling unconscious, bleeding and drowning in the water.
His anger quickly moves into concern, worst-case scenarios running through his head. He can feel his heart beating fast, his eyes flicking across his field of vision as if he could find Sherlock from this distance.
“I might have some medicine for that.”
"Okay."
When John met Sherlock the previous night, Sherlock’s hair was oily, long, and nearly flat at the scalp. Now that the grease is gone, what John can now see as
Turning away, John grabs the washcloth and re-wets it, running it under warm water. When he turns back, he sees Sherlock looking at him intensely.
John feels as if his emotional state is as obvious as a physical cloud around him, visible to every passerby.
John glances down at his speedometer, noting that he’s going nearly 20 above the speed limit. Oh well. Sherlock’s safety is worth the risk of a speeding ticket.
John looks over at Sherlock, giving him a chance to get a look at his face, no doubt telling Sherlock everything he needs to know but can't say. "You get what I mean?"
“You want to make sure no one finds out that you tackled a homeless person to the ground and gave them a concussion.”
John keeps his hands where they are, expecting a retaliation.
He moves to leave but stops when he hears John’s stern, “No!”
“Harry?”
“Come on, let’s get you in the shower, hm?”
Their lips touch, comfortable and familiar.
John turns and walks in the direction of the car. He sees Anthea step out and making her way towards him, her eyes glued to her phone.
The one-on-one conversation is nice, John has to admit. He’s eternally grateful to Bill for essentially saving his life, but as soon as John steps back out onto the sidewalk and heads home, he almost wishes Bill hadn’t.
“Miss,” says a soft, frail voice. “I apologize for the inconvenience but if you don’t lower your voice, I’m going to have to ask you to leave. You’re disturbing the other customers.”
Sherlock’s eyes soften as he looks into John’s, their trust and love soothing his frayed nerves. “I don’t want to lose you,” he whispers.
John rummages through the medicine cabinet before he finds some scented lotion an ex-girlfriend had left.
When Sherlock is standing steady, John says, “Try to walk on your own but I’m here if you need me.”
The hand he had just touched pulls away alarmingly fast, followed by an indignant shriek. The sound sharply pulls John’s attention out of his thoughts to see that he had handed the customer her cappuccino too harshly, spilling it down her blouse.
John didn’t even realise he had been doing it. “I’m making conversation.”
Some sort of choking sound comes out of John’s throat before he surges forward and kisses Sherlock with everything he has.
John grabs his cane from where it’s leaning against the booth and balances himself against it, getting ready to leave.
Come morning, John kisses the mop of messy hair on the head that’s resting on his shoulder.
“Sherlock.”
Confidence bursts in John’s chest.
He turns quickly, trying to catch a glimpse of who he just kissed.
When he isn’t working, he’s at the campus library studying. He spreads his papers and textbooks across the table he’s claimed as his, but the medical texts only remind him of Sherlock’s withdrawal.
He stops several respectful inches above his tailbone, opening his palms and running them back up in a widening path, and back down.
“Let’s get you to bed first. I’ll take care of it, I promise.”
He’s not tired, he was throughly exhausted from their activities the night before. Yes, that was very pleasant indeed. He should probably check to make sure Sherlock is alright. Although he promised to vocalize any pain, he sometimes doesn’t know what’s good for him.
John feels like an idiot. He has no reason to trust this stranger, this junkie. He sets down his half-eaten sandwich, no longer hungry.
,” the man says with an eye-roll.
“Okay, I’m gonna need–” John stops when he sees that Sherlock has laid back down and covered himself in the duvet. He sighs. “Sherlock,” he says. The name feels foreign yet familiar in his mouth, the syllables rolling off his tongue. He clears his throat and says it again. “Sherlock. Breakfast.”
Standing still for a few moments, the man takes a tentative step forward, and then another. He turns his head and looks at John as if to say,
It is not difficult to keep his face a blank slate. The drugs they have him on are strong, preventing practically any movement.
- For Heaven’s sake, John!” Sherlock slams The Strand onto the nearest table. “You might as well have said,
drunk.”
“My chest hurts, John. I think my ankle is broken, I can’t walk without it hurting.” John hears Sherlock choke out a sob, and the sound breaks John’s heart. “It
“I know you didn’t mean to, but the next time I come in to find a customer screaming I might just strangle them, and that is not very professional of me, now is it?”
“Better.”
Almost awe-struck at the sight, John rubs the lotion between his hands and, hesitantly, rubs circles into Sherlock’s cheeks and jaw, massaging the lotion into his skin.
John lifts his right hand and gently holds Sherlock’s head in place as he glides the razor from the mandibular joint down to Sherlock’s jawline, revealing smooth, pale skin beneath the foam.
“Me too, love. I miss you too”
“Go get us some coffee, John. It’ll help keep you awake for at least another hour.”
“I’m going to wake you up every few hours to make sure you’re alright, okay?”
“Alright there, mate?”
The driver steps out and opens the back door, pointedly looking at John through the glass.
They wipe down the tables, clean the coffee machines, and divide the tips in the tip jar between them. John is glad for the extra cash in his wallet.
John doesn’t look at Sherlock even though he can feel his piercing gaze on him.
The cell phone vibrates on the nightstand and Sherlock startles under John’s hands.
“An interested party.”
John places a kiss to his curls.
The junkie looks as if he’s about to snap back at John, but instead a garble of throaty groan leaves his mouth. He leans his head against the bricks and scrunches his eyes closed.
“Thank you, John.”
If he had any energy, he would run his hands across his stomach to find a swath of bandages, covering a new bullet wound to match the one on his chest.
Unconscious.
And Sherlock does.
John falls asleep to the sound of distant thunder and rain.
“‘Allo,” Crowley says with a small wave.
“But I would prefer for various reasons that my concern go unmentioned; we have what you might call...a difficult relationship.”
Fuck.
“If Sherlock does move in with you, I’d be happy to pay you a meaningful sum of money on a regular basis to...ease your way.”
Not wanting to disturb the little rest Sherlock may be getting, John quiets his footsteps as he walks down the hall toward the bedroom. He turns the knob slowly and pushes the door open.
Silence stretches between them, the pellets of rain softly drumming on the roof. It gives a background song to the stillness of the moment.
“Fully loaded. John,” Sherlock stuttered out before leaning his head against John’s shoulder. John blushed and licked his lips slowly. “Need rest. Rest with John. Safe,” Sherlock mumbled and John rubbed his neck a bit.
Chapter 10 – Can I?
Meanwhile, John sat back, just listening to the gentle bickering of the brothers, and their mother trying to desperately solve the situation. It was nothing like the arguments John was used to at home, this was more just bickering without the intention to really hurt someone. He smiled fondly, his eyes wandering to Mr. Holmes who was looking at John softly, seeing the young man enjoying himself. “They're usually like this.” Mr. Holmes said and chuckled a little. John smiled and nodded. “Good. Because I love it.” John said and smiled even bigger.
It had taken quite some time getting out of bed, but somehow the teens had made it an were in a car on their way to school. Both of them were tired, and looked quite messy, but neither of them cared. They smiled at each other in the car, they held hands, and John couldn't believe how lovely this was. Sherlock grinned at him, squeezing his hand. “Can I come watch your rugby practice later?” Sherlock asked sweetly. John frowned. “Do you really want to do that?” He asked, surprised. Sherlock nodded and shrugged. “I don't care about anyone else, I just want to watch you getting sweaty in the field.” Sherlock said and bit his lip cheekily with a chuckle. John blushed furiously. “Oh, well, sure.” John said and smiled a little, nodding. He still hadn't really... /come out/ to the team, in that sense, but maybe it wouldn't be that bad? But in reality, he shouldn't. Maybe one of them would go so far as to tell his parents, or it would travel by mouth in a way so that it would be revealed to them. And John couldn't let that happen. “Just... You know... Don't be too much.” He said and bit his lip. Sherlock frowned. Too much? What did that mean? “I... I'm not quite sure I understand...” He said and looked at John shyly. John bit his lip harder. “Just... I don't now what they'll say... If they you know... Find out about us. So far only Molly and Mike knows, pretty much.” He said and shrugged, disregarding Mycroft and Sherlock's family and Harry of course. Sherlock nodded. Now he understood, but... But somehow in his heart he had hoped John wouldn't worry that way anymore. He knew it was... natural, since he was afraid of his father, but really, he just wanted them to be able to be together, walking down the school halls hand in hand. Was that too much to ask?
“He’s not a
“Hang on Mike, I need to swing by the bleachers and get Sherlock.” John said to his friend as they headed out of the gym. Mike frowned. “Get Sherlock? Where are you getting him?” He asked, thoroughly confused. For all he knew, John was still fuming about Sherlock's behaviour. “Ah, right, I forgot to tell you, me and Sherlock are alright now. He apologised and he was very sincere so, I accepted his apology.” John said and shrugged. Mike raised an eyebrow. “Really? Just like that? After all that fuss?” Mike said and huffed. John rolled his eyes and nudged him. “Yes, really. I told you, he was very sincere.” John said and started to jog towards the bleachers. “It will only take a minute!” He called and waved back at Mike who sighed and shook his head fondly.
Mike looked even more confused now and smiled as John came back. John sighed. “I’m… I’m sorry I… You didn’t… I didn’t mean for you to find out that… I needed… Help,” John mumbled and rubbed his neck. Mike smiled softer and patted John’s healthy shoulder and gripped it just a little.
Chapter 19 - May I help you?
“My apologies, better now?” Sherlock asked and John let out a breathy constrained chuckle.
Well... It didn't work. John was getting frustrated, trying not to toss and turn, hearing soft snores coming from Sherlock. He very gently scooted out of the bed, going to the bathroom to get a glass of water before heading to his sister's bedroom. She was always up late. He knocked gently before entering slowly. “Hey, I can't sleep. And I don't want to wake Sherlock up.” John said softly and Harry nodded, sitting with her laptop on the bed. She patted beside her on the bed and John sat down, sipping gently on his water. Harry looked at him curiously with a sigh. “You're in love.” She said and John literally spit out the water he had in his mouth onto the carpet and himself. Harry wrinkled her nose. “Ew. Gross.” She said and sighed. “This shouldn't come as a surprise to you little brother.” She hummed and John quickly looked back at her, wiping his chin from the water and spit. “/In love./ In love with Sherlock bloody Holmes? No. No no no I'm a bloke I can't- I play sodding rugby I-” “And you think the fact that you play rugby is going to make you 'immune' against falling in love with boys? Wow, I thought you were smarter than that.” Harry tutted. John's cheeks heated up quickly and he looked down into his glass. “I... I suppose not...” He murmured. Harry sighed softly, closing her laptop a bit. “Bottom line is, it doesn't matter if Sherlock is a bloke or not, if you like him that way, you like him that way. It doesn't matter what gender he is.” She tried explaining. John's cheeks heated up even more, but he stayed quiet. Harry sighed softly once again. “He seems lovely, for what it's worth. A bit uptight, but very caring, at least about you.” She hummed softly. “I'm there to support you, you know. If this is what you want. Just... Think about it okay? And try not to freak out. Sherlock is Sherlock first and foremost and not just a bloke you can't date just because you're a rugby player.” She teased gently with a smile. John smiled a little back and nodded. “I'll... I'll think about it.” John said and stood up and walked to the door. “Thanks Harry.” He murmured and left to go back to his bedroom.
“So... Can I count on you coming as well?” John said finally after Mike had gone off to speak to another friend before he would leave. Sherlock let out a deep breath of relief. He had waited for John to ask him that for what felt like forever, and he was thrilled that it finally happened, even if it was after an awkward moment they'd had together. “Yes. Yes I'll be there.” Sherlock said and nodded firmly, biting his lip a bit. John smiled. “Good.” He said and grabbed his duffel bag. “I'll see you tomorrow at school then?” John said and began walking to his bus stop. Sherlock nodded again but then quickly shook his head. “My- My ride will be here soon. You... You can get a ride home if you'd like. Then you won't have to wait for the bus.” Sherlock suggested quickly, his heart pounding in his chest. Did he really offer John a ride home in the car the blonde young man had pointed out several times as something only a snob would use? Maybe it was ridiculous, but he wanted to do something nice for John this evening after everything he had done for him, and right now this was the only thing he could think of. John smiled, tilting his head, seeing the different emotions dance over Sherlock's face. “Alright then. I'll take you up on that offer. It's bloody ages until my bus arrives anyway.” John lied, knowing it was only ten minutes or so before the next bus. He walked up to Sherlock, waving at Mike and the other's before heading down the road with him.
Thanks!
Sherlock stood stiffly in the room until Mike guided him to sit down in a chair. Sherlock stared at his feet, wiggling his toes inside of his dress shoes, making the top of them bulge up and down. Mike sighed.
Mycroft was alone in the house, their parents out doing some grocery shopping. They of course had servants to do that, but Mr. and Mrs. Holmes enjoyed doing it themselves just as much. Before John and Sherlock had even reached the door, Mycroft opened it, smirking gently. “Gentlemen, good afternoon.” He said and Sherlock's cheeks heated up. He hadn't seen Mycroft since the party, the older brother being gone since the incident until this Monday morning. “Get out of the way Myc!” Sherlock yelled, pulling John close. John blushed, looking down at the ground. Mycroft rolled his eyes. “Mmm, charming, now,” He said, backing up so they could enter the hallway. “I know you're upset with me, and I know you might be as well John,” Mycroft began, Sherlock constantly glaring at him, John too afraid to look up at the older brother. “Of course I'm upset! You told me I couldn't come home and- and you threatened John and- and-” Sherlock began rambling angrily. Mycroft nodded slowly, his movements calm and collected. “Yes, yes I know. And on this rare occasion, I do want to apologise. So, Sherlock, I'm sorry.” Mycroft said and nodded his head. “And John, I'm sorry too for what I did. I'm sure you did your best with trying to protect Sherlock, and I had no right to be violent against you.” Mycroft finished. Sherlock's jaw hung almost down to the floor, and his eyes were wide and glossy. Mycroft had apologised? Did his older brother just apologise to him, /and/ his new... boyfriend? John was looking up at him as well, but his jaw wasn't dropped down to the floor, instead, he was smiling. “Oh, well, thank you Mycroft and, and I do forgive you. It was quite a chaotic moment and I'm sure things could've been handled better.” John said and nodded. Mycroft nodded as well. “Yes, they could've been, from my part mostly. You did what you could, it was a party after all, you can't be expected to babysit my little brother.” Mycroft said and chuckled a little. Sherlock didn't even react to that, still dumbfounded by the apology. “Uhm, Sherlock?” John said eventually, nudging him a bit. Sherlock quickly licked his lips and nodded. “Thank you Myc-” He gasped and threw his arms around his brother's neck, hugging him tightly. Mycroft sighed fondly, hugging his brother back. “It's okay... It's alright now...” Mycroft said and nodded, closing his eyes. “I forgive you Myc, I know you're just looking after me but- but you don't have to be so- so-” “I know.” Mycroft interrupted Sherlock, stroking his back gently. John smiled at the brothers, taking the opportunity to take off his jacket as he allowed them to have a moment together.
Hope you're all doing well!
“It is… He needs you as much as you need him really… I suppose it was the wrong choice then after all… I’ll see if I can contact Mr. Holmes and get the android changed-” Ella said as she reached for the file and grabbed it with her hand, but John stopped her, still holding on to the bottom with his, looking at the file and picture before him. She glanced up at John, wondering if her tactic had worked this time around.
Sherlock did just that, dropping his clothes on the floor and quickly pulling on the new ones he had received. They were very soft, very comfy, and they smelled like John. Perfect. He smiled and curled up cutely under the covers once more. John glanced back before quickly stripping out of his own clothes,  his bright red boxers shining with the vibrant colour. Sherlock couldn't help but peek, smiling a little at that choice of underwear. Daring. Bold. Interesting. He noted it down before quickly closing his eyes to make sure John didn't know he had been peeking. John turned around when he was fully dressed, finding Sherlock curled up under the covers once more. He wondered for a split second if he should find a way to sleep on the floor, not sure if Sherlock would be okay with sharing a bed. “Are you coming?” Sherlock asked carefully after a little bit, able to deduce what John was pondering about. John nodded quickly. “Yeah, yeah of course. Just, was checking so that I hadn't forgotten anything.” He said quickly as an excuse and moved to the bed, quickly cuddling underneath the covers, closing the telly and looking gently at Sherlock. He looked so peaceful and sleepy, and very calm. It made John's heart warm to witness such a thing. “I can move around quite a bit in my sleep just so you know, in case I bump into you or slap you in the face or something. I shouldn't but- just in case.” John rambled a little and sighed softly with a smile. Sherlock nodded. “Very well. If I get smacked in my face I know it's you.” Sherlock grinned and chuckled. John chuckled as well. “Yup, that's right.” He said and closed his eyes, trying to sleep. Though, he found himself less relaxed than Sherlock was and less sleepy than Sherlock was. He wasn't sure what he wanted to do, or what he could do. He liked... He liked being cozy like this in the bed with Sherlock, so that wasn't an issue at all. That thought was curious to him, but he accepted it fully. “Sherlock, I can't sleep.” He said softly, getting straight to the point. Sherlock opened his eyes lazily and smiled. “Poor poor John.” He teased at first with a grin but he knew how hard it could be to have troubles falling asleep. “I'm joking John. Just, try to relax. If you relax, you'll at least get some well deserved rest, even if it's not sleep.” Sherlock encouraged, smiling at John. John nodded. He was a bit selfish really. He should let Sherlock get his rest, regardless of his own struggles. “Thank you, I'll give it a try.” John promised and Sherlock settled once more.
And then it became clear to him.
Where's the Fatal Asthma attack when you need it?
And then ...
"What?" he said, his eyes widening.
"I can see that obviously this isn't working. It seems you have great difficulty engaging in sex outside of our relationship, even though it was you who first had the idea."
Mike Stamford?
To hell with Moriarty.
Plans that had been ripening for a long time and were supposed to lead to profitable success were smashed.
Well, that could wait.
"Hello Molly. Or should I rather say ... Hello, Miss Moriarty...?"
Sherlock not being the great detective he pretended to be. Nobody could be that clever. He would commit the crimes himself in order to solve them and present himself as the great saviour, it had been said. Oh, no one had ever really claimed that. They had always put question marks around it, written: "Could it be ...?" or " Is it perhaps the case that ...?". But it had had its effect: the people on the street who read these sensational papers had begun to believe the lies about Sherlock. And then more serious papers had followed with just such questions.
"… but when it comes to people, I'm just clumsy. It was irrelevant to me anyway. It's only mattered since I met you, John Watson."
Sherlock's confident expression slipped a little.
And it was at that meeting that "John Watson" had fallen in love with him.
She would jump.
My first murder.
Several times I was the victim of strange experiments and of strange substances that he stirred into my tea.
I knew Sherlock well enough by now to know that of course he would be all over this case. After all, in the conversation with Mycroft, the words "of national importance" had been uttered, and to a certain extent Sherlock too felt an obligation to his nation. For Queen and England ... pah ...!
It was just a pity that the end of his career would be rather bloody ... but there was still time before that.
She took one last breath. The air was cool and damp, cutting into her lungs. The smell of London, something she had always liked, would be the last thing she felt before she hit the pavement.
So she would jump.
"What?!"
"Here, take mine," I said, handing him the mobile phone I had acquired for "John Watson" and had prepared appropriately for Sherlock Holmes.
"Well?" she asked, " Any luck?"
Inwardly I had to grin. He was special all right, yes, and I would have a lot of fun with him.
Whose penchant for drama, whose greed and arrogance and self-absorption, whose inhumanity and obsession with power had made it all possible.
He smiled.
There I ran a bubble bath.
"John? Is Sherlock there? I've got a case for you. It could be exciting, it could be dangerous..."
Such altruistic crap was not my cup of tea. After all, that's not what I studied medicine for.
I came home from work to be greeted with the words "Tea!". Assuming he would offer me some, I had answered "Yes, please!" the first time, only to be hit with, "Earl Grey. Two sugars."
I can sum up the most important things: bad clothes, bad food and lousy TV. I was just used to better things.
But then, I must admit, I was no better myself.
But he cried from the exuberance of feelings and sensations.
When I could hardly stand it any longer, I pushed him gently away from me, whispering heavily breathing:
But who else was it?
And while John was thinking about all this, after the poor fellow had been taken away and the crime scene had been thoroughly examined and then cleared, Lestrade set about the unpleasant task of informing the murdered man's widow.
'That's the nicest thing I've ever done,' he thought as John let out a contented gasp and moved his lips gently.
"You missed me?" John asked quietly. As if to reassure himself that he hadn't just imagined it.
Happily, I chuckled to myself. I was alone, so I could be myself for a bit.
Once again John thought of the army gun. It would be so simple. Just a moment, one shot, and it would all be over.
He hated Sherlock for it, and hated himself for realising that it wasn't really true and that he really did love Sherlock.
"You bloody bastard!" he scolded. "Oh you fucking bastard! I should break your nose instead!"
The cup was drained, the plate that had recently held fresh toast with lovely bitter orange marmalade was also empty. The newspaper put aside.
To buy myself the time I began kissing my way down his stomach, licking over his belly button and teasing his thighs until he finally moaned lustfully. Last but not least, I took his penis in my mouth and began to suck him off.
The next few days would bring a lot more exciting moments.
So I got up from my laptop I had been working on and said:
Very nice, one always had the best ideas while drinking tea.
"So," he said, "and you will behave yourself now and just explain to us why we should turn up here with you so soon."
But that's exactly how I expected it to be. It would have been too bad if he had already found the solution to all this. I would much rather play on.
Moriarty sighed.
"I'll make some fresh tea first," Sherlock said quietly. John nodded. Tea, the panacea if you were British through and through, as he was.
But there was something else John wanted to know.
She had been fully briefed on John's investigation...
"John... why don't you tell me what you recognise about the shoes?"
"I love you, Sherlock," I said. "And, you know, we'll certainly argue more often. But you won't have to be afraid every time that I'll give up on you. That's not going to happen, okay?"
Once again it showed, that the old adage is right, that the truth is simply the best lie, if you are bold enough to tell it and clever enough to present it in such a way that no one will believe it.
"Jim works in IT," Molly said, also excited. "That's how we met."
John didn't really care about anything else right now, to be honest. Even Moriarty and all the criminals in the world.
"You can stop the charade now, by the way, John. We have Sherlock right where we want him, so you don't have to pretend to be on his side anymore. You've done your job well, my friend."
"Morning," I muttered.
"Yes. More than once. Enough to last a lifetime and beyond."
Oh. Wait.
John felt his eyes fill with tears.
This day had been a tough one, though.
"Come on now, tell me what's wrong!"
My personal needs, which I had not been able to take out on him, after all I needed him alive and well, had been satisfied by the young room waiter, first much to his pleasure and then to his horror. The latter, however, lasted only a very short time.
"You son of a bitch. This is the end of you. You're going to die, one way or another. But you can have it easy or I can hurt them. So WHO IS IT?!"
"You ... just sounded like Sherlock."
And yes, in the end I am to blame for the situation I am now suffering from myself.
"And now I'm giving you a choice."
I snuggled up even closer to him. Honestly, I didn't care for it now, I just wanted to be with him.
Richard nodded.
And yet, every now and then I thought how nice it would be to experience something like this with Sherlock.
Finally, we began the final preparations.
"Me!" said a voice at Molly Moriarty's back.
He couldn't, because every time he decided to use the gun, he saw Sherlock in his mind's eye, looking at him with those raised eyebrows and saying:
"You do realise, Sherlock," she said , "that my snipers are in position and will blow you and your battle dachshund here off the roof?"
So Sherlock now had the stick.
And he felt at home in Baker Street again since a long time.
And Sherlock would not be able to resist.
Pah, thought John, feelings. As if he even knew such a thing.
I had managed to get Richard where I wanted him quite quickly. He was eating out of my hand, believed my every word and was prepared to do anything for me, for us, for our "future together" that I would ask of him. Or what Moriarty would ask of him. After all, they were two different people to him.
"Yes, of course. Always. Gladly.
"That's true enough," he said. "I know someone who said something very similar to me just this morning. 'Who would share a flat with me' were his words."
Now the lady wanted to present this forgery to the art world and needed expert opinion to confirm its authenticity. Needed a credible background story for the work and the like.
Apparently his state of mind was worse than he had feared. Not only was he hallucinating his deceased roommate. Now he himself seemed to be unconsciously performing actions to make himself believe that said roommate was actually here with him. This was now clearly taking on very worrying features.
I decided at that moment to deal promptly with the young actor who was to portray Moriarty for Sherlock.
And then one Saturday night came along and I didn't feel like it.
The illusion looked at him enthusiastically.
I spilled my beer across the table.
Sherlock didn't like this woman, so there was little chance he would find out.
There was much to do.
My breath was heavy. It took a while before I was able to perceive my surroundings halfway clear again.
"Dr Watson, you seem very loyal very quickly. Very well, it is up to you. However, you should be clear why you are so quick to side with him. Your left hand betrays you."
But first I had to solve the case at the bank together with Sherlock. There were a few uncomfortable moments when Sherlock managed to get me arrested for illegal graffiti. I had to appear in court and pull some strings to prevent anyone from noticing that John Watson didn't exist.
But first we had to clarify what was wrong with Richard at the moment.
"Friend, ha. You've seen him act. How many friends do you think he has? No, I'm the closest thing Sherlock Holmes has to a friend. I'm his enemy. He'd probably call me his arch-enemy."
I grinned. So now the time had come.
It would have been a wonderful irony to have the hired murderer drive me home ... Imagine if he chose me, Moriarty, as his next victim ... it could easily happen because he had no idea who I was and didn't know my face. And with my harmless appearance and my limp, I would certainly be an easy victim in his eyes.
Moriarty clapped his hands and stood up.
Sherlock went into the game.
Mycroft took a sip of tea without stirring.
The unhealthy way of grieving.
So again an ant had survived.
Lestrade nodded. "Yes. It's hard to believe, but that's him."
And while John took a sip of soothing Earl Grey with a squeeze of lemon, just the way he liked it, and incidentally just clung to his teacup, Sherlock began to explain.
He now had this hallucination and had to try to deal with it somehow.
It's been five months since Sherlock and I were together.
So I was just going to get up and go downstairs to clear the air and make things right when my mind started to wander.
Over the years, my organization has developed unhealthily because too many people knew the name Moriarty.
"But nothing. I love you, Sherlock."
I held back and gave a few awkward things that "John Watson" would have picked out of his shoes. So almost nothing.
"It's a very simple trade," Sherlock said.
John had not, as hoped, completely collapsed and had not shot himself with his army gun, which would have been a good solution. Nor had he been admitted to a sanatorium, she would have known about that, for her contacts were far-reaching and her henchmen everywhere.
"Listen, honey," I said. "Tomorrow's Friday. I'm not on duty this weekend. so I'm going to go out tomorrow night and...have fun. With no dating site and no help from you. I'm doing it my way. Okay?"
Apparently he had hoped to be wrong until the last second. But now reality hit him with full force.
Good thing I didn't have a beer in my mouth or I'd have thrown it back across the table again.
I was beginning to come out of it.
He looked at me with big eyes, and you could tell he was trying to judge me, to deduce what I was really thinking. But apparently he couldn't. In this regard I was an exception, because there were always situations where he did not succeed with me. That was one of the things that had made me special to him from the beginning.
So as he led me into the bedroom, he said "John, I take it you had your fun tonight?"
So, when she thought about it, she had no choice.
"I have my eye on a flat in the city centre, together we should be able to afford it. We'll meet there tomorrow at 7 pm. So, now I have to go ... I left my riding crop in the pathology department."
She nodded slowly.
It was the case of the coloured dog. However, as I shone with some rather stupid remarks due to the reduced blood flow in my brain (my blood was apparently needed more urgently in other parts of my body), I did not publish this case in my blog.
That was how he knew his genius.
"You don't look scary," I replied. It was a fascinating game. Every second I had to re-evaluate how I wanted to present myself to him. How I was going to make him see in me what I wanted him to see.
"Your reputation, Moriarty. Your prestige."
"Good," Mycroft said, clapping his hands together.
Oh, Sherlock.
A tremor ran through him, but he managed to pull himself together and push back the tears.
And then he showed me what he was capable of.
"It depends," I replied.
"This is a surprise, isn't it, Sherlock?"
While the water ran into the tub, I leaned against the wall for a moment, looked at myself in the mirror and recapped the current events.
A little exhausted from the long day, he looked around and then it happened.
"Well Dr Watson, if one wants to avoid the attention of Sherlock Holmes, one learns to take unusual measures."
Lestrade and Mycroft Holmes were out of the question, they were mangling Martha Hudson instead.
Things were coming to a head in that school room over there. The killer pushed a pill jar with a capsule towards Sherlock and placed a second one in front of him.
John grinned and Sherlock just seemed stunned.
It was his mask, his protective wall ... well, I would tear it down yet.
Nevertheless. As Mycroft stood there in front of me, in his classy suit of first class quality and with his posturing, I felt that there were definitely factors that could make it difficult for me to go through with the role of John Watson professionally in front of everyone and could get me into serious trouble.
"No, Sherlock, I didn't."
John hesitated. He wasn't stupid, of course someone who was up to no good could pose so that he couldn't be seen through the peephole, and then, if the door had been opened, pounce on him.
"So you're Sherlock Holmes! I'm quite excited to meet you, Molly has told me all about you!"
I looked down at the floor, embarrassed.
She let herself fall into his arms and shivered.
It had NOT been a mistake to "forget" the tremor.
She could have planted the body at 221b Baker Street herself.
Her eyes were blazing.
For almost 10 percent of all mourners, grief is pathological.
John had first had tea with Mrs. Hudson and assured the old lady that she could always turn to him if she needed someone to talk to. She had hugged him with tears in her eyes, for at that moment they had both missed Sherlock especially.
I loved Sherlock, and yet I thought seriously about packing my bags and leaving.
He was like wax in my hands. He was so easy to manipulate in terms of his personality if you knew which buttons to push. And knowing something like that is just part of my daily routine.
But he did not see my clues.
"Oh yes," he said, smiling an icy smile that showed how fake it was. I can do better than that.
"No, John. I gather from our text conversation that you don't approve of my scheme. Which doesn't make sense to me. But because I don't want you to be angry with me, I didn't do it. I thought it best to wait until you got here so we could discuss it."
42 - just like the answer to the question of all questions, the question of meaning. And that too was a delicious joke, I thought, because the meaning of life and the centre of life is me.
I looked at Mycroft with an impenetrable stare before turning back around. I was about to leave the warehouse, but he called after me:
"Same stubbornness as ever, Dr Watson."
Yes, that would banish my boredom!
"I do," John said.
Then I realized that he SAW too and I started to keep an eye on him.
But definitely not an unimportant one.
He believed "Sherlock." A certain calm came over him.
He believed it, even if it defied all logic.
Sherlock said nothing. Not a word.
After all, I intended to serve him more false leads. First and foremost... Richard Brook. My sweet little Richard, who at that moment was waiting for his cue in a flat near the Bart.
Oh, boy, Greg was a nice guy, all in all, but he really needed to work on his timing.
He meant what he said.
"Hello John, what can I do for you?" came Mycroft's voice on the other end of the line.
The smugglers and their leader General Chan, who held Sarah and me, had no idea who I was. I was eager to see who would save us: Sherlock or the sniper I had posted in the background for safety.
Shortly after it became clear that Moriarty, the bastard, was still alive, the first voices had been raised in the press that he, Dr John Watson, should take up the matter and continue Sherlock's investigation. At first it had only been those smear sheets from the yellow press. In the meantime, however, some of the more serious newspapers had also published articles on the subject, and unlike the clamour of the yellow press, they were well-founded.
"I like the name Watson."
The two of them were obviously in a discussion about whether Sherlock could take on one of his brother's cases.
Why did I do that? Well...
Speaking of henchmen.
I no longer felt the need to go out.
But today, I was sure, everything would go flawlessly.
I don't give a damn about them myself. They don't interest me because, quite simply, I am the centre of all being.
And yet he had only scratched the surface of all this. It would take much, much more time.
What a fool he had been. He had trusted Molly. She was the only one he had never suspected. He had even trusted her enough to tell her about his suspicions of Mrs Hudson. Mrs. Hudson, holy! How could he!
He would have been lost without Mrs Hudson, who one day couldn't bear to watch it and called Mike Stamford.
What would happen next?
But I knew him well enough to know that he would put himself under pressure.
"And John?
The haircut and the posture, which suggested a past in the army, were the least of the problems.
He collapsed and began to cry.
I fired.
"Or do you prefer Holmes?"
"Sherlock! Why are you with John, for God's sake!"
"Jump," he said again.
The door opened and an elderly lady, who greeted Sherlock as "Mrs Hudson" and who was obviously the landlady, stepped out. She greeted Sherlock warmly. She seemed to like him very much. Sherlock had already told me that he got the flat cheaper because he had once done her an invaluable favour.
I had barely left the flat when my phone let out a beep.
Molly was more than just nervous.
Moriarty chuckled.
"You're behaving like kindergarten children! I think it is simply more appropriate to rejoice that Sherlock is alive, and apparently well! I certainly do, and by all appearances so does John."
He came to as Molly wiped his face with a wet flannel.
Eight.
I walked deliberately past him.
I rolled my eyes, but followed his advice and made myself a coffee. Then I sat down in my chair. The hot, steaming drink did me good.
For the next half hour I had time to get to know other characters in the drama. DI Lestrade, who had only briefly been rushing through the flat in Bakerstreet earlier; Sergeant Donovan, who dared to call Sherlock, who was after all almost as brilliant as me, a freak; Anderson, who ... well, I could understand after a few words from this ... person ... that Sherlock looked at him like he was a skunk with syphilis.
I started to think about Sherlock's motives.
I had just pulled out my mobile phone when the phone box I was next to began to ring.
That was as far as he could get it out.
Feedback? Please?
"Who else has lied to me about everything? Mycroft? Lestrade? Half the world?"
I was unable to respond.
* * *
Lambs are cute and sweet when they jump across the meadow in the light of the spring sun, but it is still fun to roast them on a spit over a low flame.
"Moriartyyyyy ..."
I actually went out the next night. I met Lestrade for a pint at the pub.
He trembled, his voice shook.
A sharp intake of breath that could be heard made John look up. He looked straight into Lestrade's completely stunned face.
Well, I can defend myself pretty well, but there were six men ... that was critical. Just as I was getting ready for some nasty wounds, two "Man in Black" appeared out of the darkness, there is no other way to describe the dark figures who quickly convinced the boys with their muscles and martial arts skills that it was better for their health to leave me alone.
And he pointed to the blanket.
"Well, he wasn't ... not a very nice person, was he?"
"Listen, John,“ Sherlock said.
It felt so great to stand here in front of him and just throw in his face that the one he trusted so much; the one he had let get so close to him like hardly anyone else .... ;
And with that, I kissed him again, wildly this time, and he beamed happily at me.
" Huh, John?"
"So," John said, "we have a criminal to catch. And I think I'm going to .... for you, well for me ... just recap everything I've found out. That will certainly help get all the facts in order."
First I, John Watson, had to admire a bit of Sherlock.
Show your cards? Well, maybe ...
So how now to bring the conversation to the boyfriend/girlfriend topic?
Sherlock giggled and let go of his fiancé.
"A good one?"
Then I took Sherlock's laptop, which was still open on his desk, and tracked the mobile phone location. The taxi driver drove to the showdown location as instructed. Excellent. Time for me to be on my way.
Oh, it's not easy to acquire capable people who can keep a cool head even in such a situation. But you can' t help it, you just have to take what you can get.
After all, it was he who had given Moriarty so much information about Sherlock. Surely he hadn't meant any harm, John didn't even want to accuse him of that. But in his ice-cold arrogance, the oh-so-smart Mr. Holmes had simply overlooked the possibilities he was putting into the hands of a master criminal like Moriarty. And when it was too late, Mycroft had not reacted quickly enough. He, who could plunge entire countries into ruin or save them from ruin, depending on how he had enjoyed his breakfast, had not been there for his brother at the crucial moment.
The next morning I woke up and the bed next to me was empty. I got up, snuggled in my bathrobe and went in search of Sherlock.
And so it was only after a few days that he was able to rest at all.
That's why the little one stayed alive.
"Sherlock," I said. "I think it's time to confess."
And yet... everything pointed to her.
"Sherlock, why do the police call you in on a case?"
If only she knew where he was. Then she could send one of her best agents after him. Mary Morstan was good at what she did, and she would certainly have coaxed a lot of secrets out of John, too.
Then there are many, their number is immense, who from time to time get commissions and are paid well, without knowing by whom. Who probably, if they knew that their orders came from Moriarty, would be horrified and no longer participate.
Seconds later, the pink mobile rang.
Rarely in her life, in her career, had she had to ask herself that. Everything had always been planned in such a way that she had not had to worry about such things. But now ...
He recognised it.
Well, this crush played into my hands and I would take advantage of it later, but for the time being it was unsuitable for my project.
I felt miserable and I wavered between crying and raving.
"Would you tell me what?" I asked, carefully.
"Sherlock, your taxi's here!"
If I ever get hold of Mycroft or Greg who told me to go through with this deception, I'll be arrested for murder.
So she took what she could get and enjoyed "Jim's" advances like an almost dried-up flower enjoys the rain.
* * *
And then he surprised me.
Her name was Nina and she was pretty, charming and funny, and like me, she just wanted to spend a nice evening without any further intentions. She was recently separated, had no interest in a new relationship yet, wanted to celebrate the new freedom.
She had never been afraid of a challenge before.
I wasn't on duty today, so I did the shopping, there was nothing in the house again, while Sherlock was doing some experiments at the kitchen table. You know, the usual.
There was no denying it: I was damn good at what I did.
Well, I said goodbye and went in search of a taxi.
You might think that's an exaggeration, but you have to remember that I intended to portray John Watson for a very long period of time, and in doing so I had to stand up to the SEEING EYES of Sherlock Holmes. And I simply believe that if you want things to work one hundred percent, thorough and meticulous preparation is essential.
And if he did, I would come up with a reason by then.
What would happen now?
Still, I was curious to know what had been left in writing. What had the taxi driver missed? It didn't really matter, the taxi man was nothing more than a puppet I had dancing on a string.
"I said, which war? Afghanistan or Iraq?"
He was sitting in the kitchen and had actually made some tea.
"I need to sort something out about... the rent."
It began with us again in an extended cuddle orgy on the sofa.
He did what had to be done. Like an automaton that always made the same movements when you pressed the right buttons.
"Hhhmmm," he just grumbled.
Only him. Sherlock Holmes.
Molly raised her eyebrows.
"Twelve hours you have to solve the puzzle. If you don't succeed Sherlock, I will be quite naughty!"
The phone rang again. Damn it, enough was enough. John decided to ignore the ringing.
John was sitting on the sofa at Molly's house.
And then I ran to my room, slamming the door.
Sherlock would figure it out, I was sure, and he would also find a way to contact "the murderer" he didn't yet know was Moriarty, I thought.
Damn, I really didn't like this at all. I decided not to loosen his bonds for the time being. For one, I thought he was so helplessly fucking hot, and two, if I actually had to get rid of him it would be a lot easier if he couldn't really fight back. And I was thinking practically.
But that was something he didn't know, of course.
Yes, after the conversation with John, which had been several weeks ago by now, he had, as expected, been completely off his rocker. But then everything had turned out differently than planned, and that bothered Molly.
"I'm sure, John."
His heart.
"John, did you remove the gunshot residue from their hands? No one would condemn you, because at the end of the day, that was emergency aid you gave. But ... it's better if you don't come to court in the first place."
So let's do it.
And he, John, was obviously snapping.
Molly paced back and forth in her flat.
When we sat on the sofa in the evening to watch a film, I often didn't really notice anything on the screen, because we cuddled, stroked and kissed all the time.
He came towards me. Lestrade ran after him.
"Don't do that, or I'll have to take off your wedding suit again..." John whispered.
"No, Sherlock."
"I'm sure you will, that would be a tough one on your ego. And that's exactly why I'm asking myself the question. How do I know you'll actually do it? That, assuming I actually jumped, you wouldn't boast about beating me afterwards, in front of the press and the whole world?"
"You think Mrs. Hudson is Moriarty? You think she's ultimately to blame for his death? Do you really think she could have fooled us all that much? That you could even be so deceived?"
Still, it was, darn it, the wrong moment and the wrong situation.
I loved him with my heart, my soul, my body.
He looked at me.
He grabbed the phone out of my hand.
They looked at each other and then they started to snort.
Swallowed.
Then I took a deep breath... I was beginning to feel that this was becoming a kind of permanent thing. Should I ever have to fill out a questionnaire again, asking for extra-professional skills among other things, I should write: Breathe deeply. I can do that particularly well now. I have a lot of practice in this.
Embarrassed, he looked at John as if he expected the latter to push him away.
So my fingers began their job.
"Did I... give you... ...give you everything you need?"
The ringing died away for the time being and John gasped.
Sherlock would have preferred to simply ignore this request, since his brother had brought it to his attention. On the other hand, he was well aware of the importance of these plans. And as much as he would deny it if it were brought up to him, he loved his country and would therefore take care of the matter.
"John, I'm coming in now!" Lestrade didn't let up. Oh damn it.
"You missed almost everything important, John, but still ... well done."
"But then you came and gave me your friendship. Just like that. Without asking for anything in return. Sure, you would have liked more consideration sometimes, I know that, but you didn't get it, I'm just the way I am.  But I still had your friendship. No conditions. And whether I wanted it or not, I started to reciprocate that friendship."
No, John had simply disappeared from the scene.
What if it was a woman?
"But, you said you didn't know him personally yourself either!" he whined.
"But I have no desire to share that with a stranger at this time. I enjoy our smooching and I can cope with it on my own. In the shower later... you know?"
Someone who, in a way, had also looked after her health concerns, because injecting Botox is not without danger to one's health ...
He was about to say something, but John's look silenced him.
Splash...
"No," the imaginary voice sounded softly.
J. Moriarty.
But above all, his cheekbones. Oh those cheekbones ...
"Oh," he said, "now I suppose I'll have to ask you if you want to go at all. So, John, will you marry me?"
Sherlock nodded. "I was in Cornwall for a few days, working on a case."
His brother and the DI! Oh boy.
Nothing bad, really nothing at all ... just meet "John Watson" on a certain day in the park, take him to Barts and introduce him as an old friend from his student days.
Well, he would have to tell Scotland Yard his suspicions, but first, before he did that, he wanted to talk to someone in private.
"I suggest, Dr Watson, that we first treat ourselves to these delicious meals. The food in this establishment is of the highest quality, and it would be a sin not to give it the attention it deserves. "
In my organization there were only two people who knew me face to face.
And of course, that didn't go unnoticed. I sat on the sofa, Sherlock knelt over my lap and we kissed. Our middles touched. And that's when he felt it.
So now it was out.
After all, in my role I only had the measly armypension and the not exactly lavish salary from the practice.
"DI Lestrade? You're serious?", I asked, grinning.
Sherlock looked regretful but accepted it.
No, he hadn't expected that.
"Yes, John. I watched. It was strange..."
"No," I said. "I'm sure that won't happen. He still needs you."
Oh yes, John hated Anderson and Donovan too. Very much so, in fact. So much so that he felt sick just thinking about them.
And he would lure him into his taxi with the promise of telling him how he had done it.
But my subconscious had probably taken over for a moment and got it exactly right.
Detectives Inspector Lestrade on the one hand and Mycroft Holmes on the other didn't seem to care, they were both very busy, because Lestrade's people had actually arrested good old Mrs Hudson and were now apparently subjecting her to constant interrogation.
He remembered well what John had written on the other invitations. He showed it to him afterwards. It said "pumpkin slush, braised zombie ribs and root vegetables from the grave, and vampire poop for dessert."
To hell with Molly.
So far, only one person had managed to do that: Sherlock.
Moriarty looked at the corpse lying here, in a place that seemed made for it. A place where a corpse seemed as natural as a duck on a pond or a little flower in a park.
"You're right. I'm sorry."
"Listen Sherlock," John said a little out of breath.
"Sherlock" was by his side whenever John set about going through the files, papers, etc., relating to the Moriarty case. He no longer went to the Yard, he worked through it all at home. He had justified this to Lestrade by saying that he was too exhausted, that all this had taken too much out of him. And that wasn't even wrong.
Moriarty chuckled and set to work.
"What?" I said, dumbfounded.
And finally, the police had not been able to find enough evidence against Moriarty, the great criminal, so that they had had to acquit him ... and again there had been rumours that Moriarty didn't exist. Sherlock had invented him ... And the police had now suspected Sherlock again and were investigating him further.
Oh fuck.
"Listen, Richard. I can promise you that nothing will happen to you. Not by Moriarty. I know that because ..."
They now both had a capsule in their hands. Sherlock kept a tense silence.
"Shit!" shouted John angrily. He felt like his heart was going to break into pieces.
It just couldn't be any other way.
He smiled too, and seemed more relaxed. And happy.
He saw the truth and there was no doubt in his mind whatsoever.
Well, yes. Surely the guy had learned a thing or two from Sherlock, and Sherlock had come frighteningly close to the head of the most far-flung criminal organisation. Thank God he'd taken the bait he'd been given and mistaken the little actor for Moriarty. Well, Sherlock was dead now and could not regret his mistake.
The one who had challenged him, whose deeds he had tracked and whose riddles he had solved.
What the hell ... ?
But my character also had to be a broken soul to a certain extent and I had to provide him with a trauma.
All the time, the figure crouched beside him, silent and worried.
Sherlock was gone and Lestrade was mad that he had left again without telling anyone. So he left with his men, grumbling and bitching that Sherlock should get along on his own.
"Well, we'll see," I said, and decided to go out the next night. I hadn't planned to, well... but I wouldn't tell Sherlock where I was going, and if he thought I'd had a sexual adventure and he was feeling better, then so be it.
When I arrived upstairs, to my surprise, instead of Sherlock, I found DI Lestrade sitting on the sofa.
Perfect.
"John, I want to make love to you and I hope that I can give you everything that you..."
But this perfectionism was making my life a little difficult at the moment.
"Will you come with me?" I asked hopefully.
But there were only a few days left until the first, really big climax. That kept me going and so I survived rancid tasting grease, scratchy Isle Of Man jumpers and screeching TV voices.
During his following explanation of how he had come up with it and how the murderer had administered it, I didn't really listen to him, I knew anyway.
Molly would listen to him.
Well, I had both.
The hair of various small animals on his jacket and the invoice from a pet food wholesaler who did not distribute his goods himself but only supplied them to en-detail retailers. Which proved that he was not simply a pet owner but was in the business of doing so.
The usual profit-making crimes were going on without Moriarty's direct intervention, so the Criminal Mastermind could turn to personal pleasure.
One could play with him like a puppet, and yes, that did promise to be interesting.
And so they both waited until Mycroft and Lestrade appeared in Baker Street.
How ridiculous. I tried to imagine how a real John Watson would feel about this absurd situation. He would probably think Mycroft was something I claimed to be: a criminal mastermind.
Seven...
"NO!!!!
I inwardly gave myself a high five.
"Sure thing," Lestrade said with a grin. "Are you saying it's true about the solar system?"
Good. So the taxi driver was there. He had followed my instructions. The showdown was approaching.
"No, oh ... no, Sherlock, I'm not ... interested ... as I said I'm not gay."
"But tell me this, Dr Watson: how did you put me onto it?"
"Oh, Mrs. Hudson, I would have liked to have had a domestic quarrel with him, because that would mean that he and I .... oh forget it."
The last step was missing.
"John, I have it on good authority that these two have also abandoned the concept."
So the man who was now standing in one of London's busiest squares, pager in hand, explosive waistcoat around his waist, and who, if Sherlock had failed, would not only have died himself but would have taken dozens of others with him, stuttered into the phone just as awkwardly as the little bitch from the previous case.
"I'm afraid you'd better believe him," Sherlock said.
But there was no denying it.
Molly Moriarty had not been so amused for a long time.
John shuddered. This was not the Sherlock he knew, and yet ...
Should I do that?
"John, I'm scared."
I smiled. I suppose it was probably for the best.
Heavens, was this man beautiful, and even more beautiful in the excitement.
"John, you're a doctor?"
"All right, all right," and then he got undressed and he took a shower.
My goodness, I was getting hot again.
But no, "Sherlock" was still sitting there silently. With that smile, mouth agape, eyes flashing, that smile he had always had just for him, John.
"Sherlock" was wringing his hands frantically. He was still shaking his head vigorously.
They do real things, no question, and what they do may affect me. Yeah, they breathe, they eat, and they excrete the remains. They can hurt me and they can cause me pain and they can make me feel pleasure... and yet, they're... different. They're not important.
Sherlock sighed.
Richard, the little beast! Just to have him call on one of the Yard's work phones! I cringed inwardly, while looking expectedly serious as John Watson.
My sniper did his job.
That was exactly my motive. Well, actually one of my motives.
Aha, so he seemed to want to ask questions .... oh well. I would have to keep an eye on him not asking too many in future.
"What would you ask for in return?"
John did not dare raise his eyes at first, he hesitated, but then he did.
"I give you my word," Sherlock said.
I took his face in my hands.
And last but not least: the way he had been arranged. The way the dead man's identity card had been pressed into his hand. That, in turn, made it clear that he had been a purposefully chosen victim.
He didn't answer my question.
When John got out of the shower, he brushed his teeth and did his hair, the first time in weeks. His nose wrinkled at the pile of sweaty clothes he had been wearing until just now.
The next moment Sergeant Donovan stepped into the office with a phone receiver in her hand and astonishment on her face.
Richard.
God, everyone around me was so stupid. None of them SAW...
And that was why John hated him.
He had watched video footage of every possible incident associated with Moriarty. Of interrogations of convicted or suspected perpetrators thought to be connected to Moriarty. Hours of it.
So for now he closed the door and went back into the house.
"Gregory," John whispered, looking desperately at the policeman.
Speaking of knowledge - I, John Watson, of course didn't know who was actually standing in front of me.
When he opened his eyes again, the figure had disappeared.
"So let's have it out," he said, "what's bugging you?"
It was me who made sure that he at least ate something now and then, by making sandwiches or bringing food from the Chinese or Indian restaurants.
Yeah, I fooled Sherlock.
She wouldn't.
Very well.
Sherlock greeted him by saying, "Where?"
Anyway ...
"Will you do it?"
It would have been too funny after all.
Sherlock's eyes became so dark again, so inscrutable.
"I've made up my mind, Sherlock. But before I tell you my decision, I want to know one more thing: How did you escape my people in Serbia?"
I visited a therapist twice a week, a terribly incompetent person.
So I jumped up, screamed angrily:
"John?" he asked, uncertainly. "Are you very angry with me?"
"Well," I snarled, "Well, I know now anyway. However, Mr Holmes, didn't you say earlier that you had no feelings in your life?“
"Mycroft... I know that Sherlock, my beloved partner...“ I emphasised the last two words in particular, "...even before the start of our romance of which you are undoubtedly aware..." He waved it off. Of course he knew. "...discussed with you the nature of certain very intimate details of this relationship."
Saw them having fun that night.
And then he came, into my mouth. And he was breathing heavily, and so was I.
And I was sleeping with Richard and so the circle was complete.
Then the matter of the missing USB stick with the Bruce Partington programme came up.
The woman who called now was an unimportant piece on my chessboard.
And so we're approaching the dramatic climax. The situation that I'm in now.
The reason for this was simply that the murder Sherlock was supposed to solve had not yet been committed at the end of the Janus Cars case.
And my life says: Fuck it, they can!
He didn't care. He didn't want to change it, and secretly he dreaded the day when he would have to face the facts and also give up "Sherlock", now that he had already lost Sherlock. And so he blocked out these thoughts as best he could and simply enjoyed it as it was.
"No, Sherlock," I said. "I appreciate your concern for me, but there's no need for it at the moment."
He smiled.
It didn't happen until the following day and I let two more days pass after that because I was amused by the way Sherlock was getting more and more restless by the hour. It was a mixture of new-found boredom on the one hand and great impatience and tension on the other. Because, of course, it was clear that the whole affair was not over yet and would go on.
I could be relieved that I was such a good doctor and especially that my patients liked me so much. I just seem to have a knack for sick people and their mental states, at least my patients idolize me, and that has saved my job a few times when Sherlock has really torpedoed it.
The phantom listened to him with interest and let him know clearly what he thought.
He would be able to play a mad genius. The kind of genius Sherlock Holmes would expect.
The more he thought about it, the more possible it seemed.
As I've told you before, Sherlock had erased all the data on our solar system. It was not important, he had said.
Greg looked at me in surprise.
"Is that really Sherlock? Is he here? Do you see him too?"
When I then decided to return to you, I was standing here in front of the door and you opened it. And there you were standing in front of me and it went through me like lightning. I put the pieces of the puzzle together in a split second and it was clear to me how I felt. And so I decided at that moment not to speak to you, so I wouldn't say the wrong thing and you wouldn't turn away from me. And that's how it all came about."
I grinned wryly.
"Never mind, Mycroft. But answer me one question: did you at any time inform Molly Hooper of my second 'death' in Serbia?"
"Yes," he said, "that's perfectly all right. As long as your heart is mine, I can share your body with others."
He took a deep breath, tried to fight back the tears, but could not.
To see how far his knowledge had really progressed.
He explained to me what he thought he had recognised the "facts" about me in the lab yesterday.
"What?!", I responded dutifully.
Mike grinned and at my look said, "Yeah, he's always like that."
The first thing I did was text Richard saying, "It's on."
Even a genius planner like me cannot completely predict the human factor, it will always remain a variable in any calculation.
"Well," Sherlock went on to say, "first I actually wanted to be with other people ... to practice ... but I couldn't. I thought about you all the time and I couldn't do it and I didn't want to. And then I met Charlie. A very likeable person. He's a little like you."
John was a doctor, and even if psychology had only been touched upon in his studies of general medicine, he knew at least a little bit about the multi-level phases of mourning. It was part of it that it took a few days to really understand what had happened.
Richard was sleeping with Molly.
I stumbled up the stairs. Sherlock was sitting on the sofa, working on the laptop. Mine, as I realised, despite the fog in my head. Anyway...
"You're punctual, Dr Watson. I appreciate that. Come along.“
John felt better. Slowly but surely the pain was subsiding, for Sherlock had, it seemed, returned... for his own sake more than anything else.
Would Molly in this way, even in death, still harm him, Sherlock, and his John, and in this way triumph, as it were?
"John Watson" survived too.
That the man he loved... was not Moriarty.
What, John was staggered by this audacity. This beast was trying to make him out to be a traitor! His gaze went to Sherlock, and to his bottomless relief he saw Sherlock wink at him.
After a night on Sarah's uncomfortable sofa (I would make that woman suffer yet for her arrogant manner towards Watson ...) I made my way back to 221B Baker Street.
„Fellatio?" I asked softly.
I had taken care of some snacks, had chosen a film that I hoped that we both wouldn't see much of, as so often, and was looking forward to another beautiful evening.
"Obviously," Sherlock said, rolling his eyes.
Now he only had to think a little further and then he would come to the conclusion that a photo from the inside of 221 Baker Street was probably the easiest thing to do for someone who lived in that house.
What was he going to do now?
Unlike Sherlock, Mycroft Holmes was in the know about what I was doing on those evenings. Or what I wasn't doing. I knew that, and I found it out very clearly one night when I was under a bit of stress.
He opened his eyes.
A moment later, he was standing in our flat, hanging up his coat, running his hair down. Then he came over to me, and he was a little indecisive. He looked at me, bent over, kissed me and sat in the chair.
One guy kept messing with my business.
"You traded my death for the lives of my friends then. I went along with it. In pretence, I thought, but I realise now, of course, that the moment you decided to help me, you were also pulling strings to have me done in Serbia later. By the way, your people there are not worth their money. You should invest in better training... oh wait, you can't do that anymore."
With an angry groan, John dropped onto the sofa.
His perpetually drunk sister Harry ... never.
"Oh," he yelled, "poison!"
You can't simply call a shareholders' meeting, pay out the last dividend, dissolve the structures and dismiss the employees.
Sherlock laughed.
He looked at me, asking.
Richard stepped in, "startled" when he saw that Molly was not alone.
Yours, Ladi
"Probably," he said at last, "even you can't stop what these greasers print ..."
Sherlock argued loudly with Lestrade, Donovan and Anderson. He defended the fact that he had no drugs in the flat. He also defended the fact that the victim's suitcase was in the flat. It was noisy and heated and eventually Lestrade told his men to stop the search.
Play or take off the mask?
There was only one person who knew that Sherlock had studied the structure of the solar system following this case for that very reason.
"What?" he asked.
Sherlock seemed to have the map of London pretty well in his head. Well, he got it wrong in one or two places and I could have shown him a shorter, better way.
My left hand.
_______________________
His eyes were shining like feverish, his breath came in puffs and, well, on my thigh I felt that his penis had stiffened quite a bit.
This was our first case together. And through everything that had happened, everything I had done or said, I had managed to awaken Sherlock's interest in me and to bind him to me in a certain way.
Across town, Mycroft Holmes had received a call from one of his subordinates about half an hour earlier.
"Excuse me?"
I was not one of those who used violence and "ripped off" other children in the schoolyard. I had better methods, and in principle that has remained the same until today. Well, I have nothing against violence and blood, but I don't like to get my hands dirty. I have my people for that.
"Yes," she breathed softly, "John, I don't understand! What's wrong with you?"
Eventually, however, John got hold of it.
"And who's going to stop that? You, Sherlock? Or your little hound dog, John?"
You know, emotional things.
"John, an emergency call just came in, there's a body in the hallway at Mrs Hudson's place on Baker Street!"
"I know that you were in Afghanistan. You were wounded there and that's why you returned. You have a brother whom you don't ask for help because you don't get on well with him. He is probably an alcoholic. And he recently left his wife. Your therapist thinks your limp is psychosomatic and rightly so. That's enough to start with, don't you think?"
My sniper in the pool was in place. So were the two outside who had an eye on the entire area.
As I was writing this, I had already thrown on my jacket, stormed past my boss' room and shouted something about "I have to go, it's an emergency!“ I could well imagine her rolling her eyes.
Well, he was going to have that. I began to spank his sweet bottom gently at first, then more vigorously.
"Yes, John. You're looking at Moriarty. The Moriarty. The Great Moriarty, to be precise. And believe me, I've enjoyed tricking you and Sherlock."
Later on, there was some kind of film on the television, but I didn't notice anything, because he had started cuddling again right at the beginning of the cinematic crap and he was, well, very enthusiastic today.
Henchmen were arrested, important people in the organisation disappeared.
"John, please, I want you to make love to me."
So now the good John Watson had learned that his great brilliant Sherlock had deceived him.
"Yes, John. That's what you do when you want to get married, isn't it?"
So was it reasonable for him to drag Molly, whose heart was struggling with grief as much as his own, into it and burden her with it all?
John's whole body trembled.
However, no one met us and I got into the car unseen. Richard packed what needed to be packed and we drove off. While he drove the car through the streets of London, I sat in the back and checked my smartphone to make sure everything was as I had instructed.
And that was why he couldn't help himself.
Any moment now, I would serve Sherlock 'Jim'.
Any moment now ...
"Let the game begin!"
They had found out earlier than planned that Moriarty was still alive and still in hiding, pulling the strings of so many crimes that it could make a law-abiding citizen's breath catch.
He had simply left me there.
"There was one more thing I underestimated."
But he hadn't got that far yet, and once again it became apparent that Sherlock really wasn't as cold-hearted as he always claimed. For those feelings that dwelt within him blocked his objective view of these things.
"Who said anything about a flat share?"
I took a deep breath. Again.
Oh man, I was burning up.
They were scurrying all over the place.
He knew it wasn't supposed to feel like that.
But it was about to get worse.
Damn it all, this was extremely unpleasant.
So I would have to rethink some moves.
I went off on my own for an afternoon.
The second difference is that social norms are often a mystery to him.
"That's why I liked him from the start. He was also very understanding. He just wanted to dance a bit, have some fun, that's all. He has a boyfriend, you know? I just told him my problem."
When the time came, I dragged Sherlock to a small Asian takeaway, right at the time of broadcasting this person's strange makeover show.
I'm unhappy.
Sherlock looked at him questioningly.
After all, he gradually became more and more convinced that he had been dealing with Moriarty all along. The taxi driver had described Moriarty as a fan of Sherlock's at the time and the one he was dealing with here kept dropping remarks like this ... "we were made for each other", and the like ...
He beamed and kissed me.
"Was I right? I was right, wasn't I? Is this the good capsule?!"
"Well," I said, "Let's let Sherlock think that I ... I'll find the satisfaction of my needs elsewhere."
The one who had been throwing bodies at his feet for the last few weeks.
John did indeed look terrible, pale, deranged and with a facial expression that did not bode well. He seemed to be completely out of it, almost ran over an old lady, ran in front of a car and it was only thanks to the quick reaction of the driver that nothing had happened ...
"Hey, don't make that face, kiddo. We'll get together whenever possible."
I was so aroused and felt his penis, which also stood like a spear, on my thigh.
When we got out of the taxi and he also asked me:
John hated Moriarty. Of course he did.
"Moriarty? Are you here? I've brought you something! The Partington plans. That's what they wanted, wasn't it? That's why you pulled all that nonsense, isn't it?"
"No."
We were laughing so hard that we could not answer it.
I turned back to him.
Sherlock didn't seem to find the whole thing funny, though.
It turned out he did.
So she approached me through intermediaries.
"Shoes?!" said I, John Watson, with as much amazement in my voice as I could manage.
A glance at me.
"Tell me, Sherlock, these suicides, there are three so far... isn't that something you should investigate?"
So when the request had come to me to get her out of the way, I had immediately and happily gone along with it.
Would Molly's death cause a rift in the love that was just growing between him and John?
Sherlock didn't even look up.
When he woke up, there was a tray of tea and biscuits on the table. Mrs Hudson, the good soul.
It was then that I learned, to my greatest delight, that Sherlock was looking for a flatmate for a flat in Baker Street.
Why had none of my subordinates known about it?
As he summed up his findings, lightning struck him.
I scurried back downstairs and headed out.
As he stood there in front of me, with his big, soulful eyes, red lips and slender, boyish figure, I couldn't help myself. I pulled him to me, pressed my body against his and clawed my hands into his tight buttocks. Even though he was bugging me a bit at the moment because he was obviously planning to cause trouble, he was just sexy as hell and I felt like giving him a good fucking before I called him to order.
"Careful, we're dealing with a bomber here!" said Lestrade, who, for reasons I couldn't fathom, was displaying a kind of protective instinct towards Sherlock.
With the other victims he had simply known how it would end.
"Is it him? Moriarty?"
Until death do us part.
And I hoped that the little one would not give me any trouble.
"Well, that it's perfectly all right.“
But that would have been totally absurd, after all he pushed me into this situation with his teeth and nails.
It almost killed him with pain.
A little confused, since the doorbell had jolted him out of his thoughts, he got up and went to the front door. As Mrs Hudson was not there, who would normally open the front door downstairs, he had to walk down the stairs himself.
Vain little brat. But he did look adorable. And damn it, a little bit I envied him. I was just tired of jeans and knitted jumpers.
I never did that. Had never done it before.
No, it was about sex.
So I had appeared as a character on Sherlock's board earlier than I had intended.
And now here I sit. Home alone. Waiting for him.
Oh boy, how did I get myself into this stupid situation. John Hamish Watson, you can be a real idiot sometimes.
And then he left Lestrade standing there for good.
This all promised to be very amusing.
Yes, it was still great fun chasing criminals alongside Sherlock. Yes, I was still not bored, not for a second. And yes, it was still obvious that I was playing my role perfectly.
That was also the reason why I, Moriarty, let him handle me like that. It was fun to have him right where I wanted him.
He almost reared up under me. God, it was hot.
"No, damn it! I'm not coming now! Oh, maybe I will... what I mean is, I'm not coming to a crime scene now!“
You can't fake a doctor, I know that. But I didn't have to, I have a medical degree, next to another in chemistry. I did it at a young age out of boredom, and because I thought that it certainly couldn't hurt to have some medical knowledge when choosing my profession.
It was as if destiny had intended for me to start my "game".
He opened the door to the Chinese restaurant for me and led me straight into one of the alcoves that had a door that could be closed and was therefore private.
"Shit!" I cursed. I didn't need that shit. Tubing half of London in wet trousers. Hallelujah.
But now it was time to devote myself to Richard.
The only question was, now that he knew about the difficulties of his own personal grieving ... would he cope or would it all get worse?
I memorised the young room waiter's face for two reasons. Firstly, who knows, maybe I would have a little time for him at a later date ... and secondly, it was necessary to prevent him from memorising my face too thoroughly, as well as that of young Mr Brook.
The little thing looked harmless, just like you'd expect "John Watson's" to look. With all the files and exactly the internet history you would expect "John Watson" to have.
"Yes, John."
Back at Baker Street, I found Sherlock still over his microscope.
When we said goodbye, we walked a few more yards in the same direction. Before we parted, Greg stopped, scratched his neck again and then said (we remember the "fuck, yes!" that had my life still up it’s sleeve?):
"Oh, one more thing. Your brother - did he know?"
Sherlock barely glanced at my little Richard. He was busy with his microscope - it looked like he had just made a discovery, because the message "match found" was flashing on the screen of the connected computer.
"The best." Yes I know my tendency to show off will get me into trouble again. But what can I do when I'm actually the best.
"How the hell do you know that now... Right. Mycroft. Couldn't keep his mouth shut, could he?"
I judged him to be selfish and with quite few scruples. He wouldn't mind kicking others' butts. However, if it was a question of risking his own admittedly very attractive butt, it would be a different matter. And that's exactly what it would come down to.
Very well, I, Moriarty, could have given him a few more details. However, as Dr Watson, I only established the cause of death and a few minor trivia.
"I'll get you to bed, John, and then I have some more research to do."
A knock and Lestrade's voice calling out loudly:
"Now out with it, Sherlock, where is it? Where do we have to go?" scolded Lestrade.
So the whole world knew about it.
Lestrade and I got on quite well and we'd been doing this now and then. The last time, though, was a while ago. When I phoned him to arrange a time for us to meet up he was a bit embarrassed at first. But that settled quickly, so we both met around seven o'clock in my favourite pub.
"I was quite surprised, I wasn't expecting you and Mycroft.“
"And ... does he use you ... in other ways too?"
They were sitting opposite each other and seemed to be talking tensely.
"Will it be an Self-empowerment in his eyes that we have become so close?" he asked. Clever boy. He was asking exactly the right questions.
"I don't think he wanted to come in the first place. He only got over it because he actually wanted to have the conversation with me. Hurt him and I'll make the world believe you never existed."
Molly nodded.
"Listen, Sherlock. Why is the bomber playing with you? Do you have any idea?"
He had a case for us, and we set off.
Yes, the next few months were going to be exciting in more ways than one.
A sideways glance from Sherlock to me.
And so it happened that three days later, for the first time after his shift at the hospital (he had to make a living, after all), he sat at Scotland Yard over a pile of files and reopened the Moriarty case.
"No more open relationship?
John was bowled over. But ... it fitted. As much as he wanted to find reasons that it didn't, it did fit.
It was so pleading, almost childlike, I couldn't help smiling.
Arriving at the Yard, DI Lestrade dragged us straight into his office.
Damn it, he didn't want to start crying here, in the middle of a crowd.
I made the mistake of listening to Mycroft and not sticking to my first impulse to communicate clearly and honestly what was going on. I can only take credit for doing it with the best of intentions.
He had waited with her until her sister had arrived to take her in for a while. Mrs Hudson did not want to stay in the house until the murderer was caught, who had after all managed to dump a body on the stairs in the house. John could understand that.
No, she couldn't imagine that.
And I smiled. Yeah, that was his style. And I loved him just the way he was.
He had confusing incoherent dreams.
Jesus.
And before I had the chance to make him understand that there was no problem at all, he sank into his memory palace.
But actually, J. means something else.
I had a lot planned for Richard. However, I had doubts as to whether he would be willing to do so.
"I never really thought I was that naïve," he said quietly. "But more and more I think I'm too inclined to see the good in people .... oh I don't know either."
But I just couldn't imagine him doing something like that, you know... I wanted Sherlock just the way he was.
But in the end, none of that was a problem. It was just ... like I said, I hated it when someone got in the way of my plans.
For the fact that the message had come to her mobile, from whoever, clearly showed that someone, anyone, knew that she, Molly Hooper, was in fact Moriarty.
The lock turned and slowly the door was pushed open.
"Well, he's not usually the one who's hands-on, he organises it all and stays in the background himself. No one ever has any direct contact."
He looked at me.
"Listen. The one who pays you for the murders. Who is that?!"
There he turned once more and looked at me.
He had pushed me onto the sofa and was now lying over me. He kissed me so intensively that I felt hot. His lips moved down my neck where he nibbled a little bit. At the same time he began to run his hands under my shirt and wipe it off me.
Again I put my index finger in front of his lips.
Getting to that point was a difficult thing. Which was mainly because, although everyone in the world suspected we were involved, I, on the other hand, was always and everywhere shouting out, "I'm not gay!"
And Molly seemed to sense that.
How often had he sat here and listened to his mad genius play the violin.
Well, I suppose the only right thing would be to go down there and set the record straight. Make it clear to Sherlock that I, for one, was not interested in an open relationship.
Molly Moriarty feared failure.
It was then that Mycroft showed that he might well be dangerous to me.
"Does that mean he's still alive?" he virtually screamed.
Sherlock's brain was like Moriarty's. Logical, quick as a flash, unravelling the threads in the game immediately.
"And... How are things with you and Sherlock?" Greg asked after a while.
What the hell was going on here? John tried to grasp and sort out the situation somehow. But he simply did not know what was happening to him.
I had just poured myself a scotch and decided to get drunk when I heard the front door rattle. Footsteps sounded on our stairs. Sherlock's footsteps.
We repeated what we had experienced. That same night. And the next. And the next...
While Angelo placed a candle on our table with the words, "That makes it more romantic!" and I called out again, "I'm not his date, okay?", I laid out my strategy.
Sherlock smiled.
For the first time since the whole adventure began, I had a slightly uneasy feeling.
The car took me all over the city and finally brought me to a warehouse on the outskirts.
These two loved each other. Moriarty found love, like other human emotions, superfluous and disturbing. Quite disgusting, in fact. But she could use it wonderfully, it had always worked brilliantly so far.
Why did the plans he had worked out so carefully with Sherlock, even before the latter had jumped off the roof of the Bart, not seem to be working?
A puppy dog, toddling around me and doing things to make his master proud.
And threw a single word into the room.
Sherlock had taken a liking to it, he was eager to learn, so it wasn't long before he too was able to give me a wonderful blow job... and he got good at it. Damn good.
I looked at him astonished. "Sorry?"
I was smiling. I wonder how he'd react to that.
"I'm afraid I'll probably be doing things to make you angry with me more often, too."
"I didn't order a taxi," he hissed.
"But Sherlock, now who is Moriarty?"
"Does that mean," he asked, "that you still want me?"
And then I decided to release the tension and shatter the clarity of the moment.
My hands stroked along his body.
Sherlock's gaze was on me for a moment before he turned back to the window. In those few seconds, I saw a sort of shadow seem to settle over his eyes.
“It's okay. It's okay alright?” John said, grabbing a towel that Peter had brought to him. He started to soak up the drink that had spilled onto Sherlock's trousers, on his lap mostly of course, before quickly realising just where he was patting. “Uh, uhm, sorry, here, you do it.” John stuttered quickly, blushing and handing Sherlock the towel. Sherlock took it and held it against himself, feeling utterly ashamed and about to break down. John sighed and bit his lip, seeing the state of him. “I promise you it's okay. No one is thinking anything bad about you. Accidents happen.” John said and opened his duffel bag which he had brought with him. “You can have my clean shirt and I can wear my rugby shirt.” John said and quickly started to strip out of the shirt he was having on. Sherlock stood dumbfounded and frozen in place, positively gawking at John as the other began undressing. He realised he was doing it quite quickly though, and spun around to face the other way. John chuckled. “It's alright. I share changing rooms daily with other blokes, it's fine.” John said and held the clean shirt in his hands. “I'll turn around for you though.” He said, and did just that. Sherlock peeked over his shoulder, making sure John was turned the other way before undressing gently. “Shirt.” Sherlock murmured softly and John handed it to him behind his back, reaching down to pull on his rugby shirt instead. “Are you dressed?” John said with a soft smile and with a gentle “yes” from Sherlock, he turned back around. “Hmm... That's a bit big on you, but you look pretty good in it anyway.” John said as he looked at Sherlock in the oversized shirt. He looked quite adorable, and yet again John found himself wondering why he thought that. Sherlock was blushing harder at that and nodded gently. John's shirt was so soft... and warm... and it smelled of John as well, a scent he hadn't yet picked up on this strongly. He secretely hoped John would forget and that he could keep the shirt for himself, but he doubted that. “Do you want to change trousers as well? But pretty I'm certain mine will just fall off your hips...” John murmured and rubbed his neck. Sherlock shook his head. “Trousers are fine. They're practically dry now thanks to the towel...” Sherlock murmured, becoming a bit more eloquent now that he had gotten some clean clothes. His cheeks were still a deep shade of red though, but he hoped that somehow John wouldn't notice. “Thank you... I... I mean it. Thank you so much...” Sherlock murmured shyly, shuffling a bit on his feet. John smiled, feeling his own cheeks heat up a bit at the sincere thank you he had gotten from Sherlock. “You're welcome. Now, let's get back to the table yeah? Peter has cleaned up our spot so it will be mess free as well.” He said and smiled at Sherlock before holding the door for him so that they could head back to the table.
“I think we can end early for today. You seem to have your schedule full anyway with your new… Friend,” Ella said and gave John a knowing smile before she headed to the door and out from the warm flat. John stood alone in the living room, nodding his head slightly.
“First of all, it’s a
“I don’t have a function like that. As you said, I’m different. Please stop asking stupid questions,” Sherlock said stiffly and the android hummed quietly.
“Hey, Peter! A large pepperoni pizza for me. Make it extra large yeah?” John said to the owner of the place, giving him back the menu. “And a coke for me and, Sherlock?” John asked and Sherlock flinched, having not been ready to order anything. “I'll have the same.” He said quickly, looking back down. Mike was laughing, sitting a bit further away, but he glanced over to John. John smiled back, but gave him a look and knew that Mike understood that Sherlock was proving difficult, but that John wasn't about to give up on him yet. John started to talk to the person sitting next to him on his other side, and Sherlock felt very awkward just sitting there on the end, doing nothing. But he couldn't expect John to pay attention to him every second, he supposed. Even though that would be wonderful indeed.
I myself was as taut as a spring.
"I am fully aware that you did no such thing. You had no opportunity to do so because you were under our surveillance."
Some crimes that would virtually mock John Watson.
On the other hand, after holding it under the nose of the horrified Molly, he had pocketed the note.
When I came to, breathing heavily, the little guy was still kneeling and looking up at me.
Sherlock would have sex with someone else!
I raised my upper body slightly so that I made it easier for him and the shirt landed in the corner.
I would have to repeat such a weekend with him once in a while. Well, have to was perhaps the wrong word. I thoroughly enjoyed it with the little one.
But after all, John was not only a doctor but also a soldier, he had already seen the war with his own eyes, felt it in his own flesh.
"Well, I suppose you have so much decency, that YOU understood that no means no, and I don't have to defend myself against YOUR intrusions?" I asked sarcastically.
The weekend with Richard had ended satisfactorily and, above all, purposefully. I didn't have to worry about him for the time being.
Pleasing myself right here in front of him?
And for the first time since he had been there, he touched John.
He wanted to know if he would succeed in choosing the right capsule. He wanted to know if he could do it, wanted to know which would be the right capsule. Even if it cost him his life.
Ultimately, however, her job was to protect me and, should it prove necessary, to incapacitate Sherlock.
And strange as that was:
A few other people who must have recognised him - after all, he was a well-known figure in London - gave him questioning looks.
Had loved.
I would therefore have to present "Moriarty" to him sooner than I had planned.
Sherlock would die.
Smart thinking.
It was exciting and thrilling and I wasn't bored.
"Um... I don't..."
Great things were yet to come from him.
Lestrade was about to cross the room in quick strides. When he reached the armchair, he yanked "Sherlock" - ... Sherlock to his feet and pulled him into a bone-crushing hug.
Sherlock picked up the phone from her hsnds.
Yes, she had made her decision.
It swung wide open, I stepped through and it slammed noisily shut again.
Slowly.
"Yes," I breathed happily, "and... Watson. I'd like it if we were both called Watson."
They walked hand in hand.
Richard sighed.
The previous assumption that all Moriarty knew about Sherlock had stemmed from what Mycroft had told Moriarty, albeit with the best of intentions, proved inadequate. Sherlock and Mycroft, while loving each other in their own twisted Holmesian way, were not very close. So that Mycroft could simply not have known many of the details of Sherlock's current life, surveillance or not.
"Girlfriend? No. That's not my area."
Again the man only rasped.
I snorted.
I pushed him away a little, sat up.
"I'd rather text," he growled.
"I must offer you my deepest respect, Dr Watson. It seems you have succeeded in what we have tried so unsuccessfully for so long. Moriarty is unmasked."
I shook my head. That dear, sweet fool.
Rubbish, John thought, as he pushed himself out of his chair and went into the kitchen to make himself some tea. That might all be true, but still. He had never been more than Sherlock's assistant. He was nowhere near as smart as the detective, well, maybe a little more practical. Quite a lot, actually. But still. To carry on Sherlock's investigative work - no. He just didn't trust himself to do that.
Wasn't that still too much for him?
"John, I ..." Sherlock seemed a little perplexed. A thing that didn't really happen often....
We had a lot of fun together and in the end we agreed to repeat the whole thing for the next evening.
I didn't know what to do. Talk or wait? Something must have happened.
And when I thought about the fact that this man, with all his magnificence, with his beauty, with his peculiarity, wanted me, me, the somewhat too small, averagely intelligent and otherwise rather unspectacular John Watson, I got really dizzy.
"Sherlock, we can't be giggling here, this is a crime scene!"
I lay on my bed in my room and I thought it over.
So, when one put it all together - no real danger.
"Yes. Problem?"
John, the man who had just attached the cufflinks to his shirt sleeves, and who in less than two hours would no longer be his fiancé but his husband, smiled.
Yes, he would do a good job.
He hung up and dialled Miss Hooper's number afterwards. Maybe she could tell him why John was so rattled.
"I want to know more. Tell me why!"
It was only when we had calmed down after a few minutes that Sherlock picked up his mobile. It had been Lestrade, and Sherlock called back immediately.
Because her lines of communication no longer worked, many of her underlings no longer existed.
Finally, I pulled myself together to say a few words.
Such was the general opinion of the press, and by now the public, and the demands that he should take a position on this were growing louder.
When his bottom had finally turned a beautiful pink, I manoeuvred him off my lap and pushed him over the edge of the bed. I knelt behind him and then began to fuck what little sanity was left out of his pretty head.
The man seemed smarter than he appeared at first glance. I would have to keep a close eye on him too.
But could one be sure that this man was not simply a great actor? John didn't think much of Mycroft Holmes, and it wouldn't really have surprised him if Sherlock's own brother, who had already called himself Sherlock's arch-enemy in the past, actually turned out to be his true arch-enemy Moriarty in the end ...
So someone who had easy access to the rooms in Baker Street?
His silky black curls.
"Friends. People who like them. People who don't like them so much. A girlfriend, a boyfriend maybe ..."
John had to grin against his will.
"I understand that the situation is different with you two. No question. But, John, I agree with Myke. Right now it's probably for the best of both of you. Sherlock can take it easy and you've got all the options.“
And after a while:
That went down well with John.
She walked up to John and reached out for him.
He was an extremely good-looking fellow with a finely cut face and expressive, dark eyes. He was also talented. It was almost a bit of a pity about him, but sacrifices have to be made and it didn't matter which (as long as I'm not the sacrificed, of course).
The look Sherlock was giving him at that moment could have been sold for a lot of money.
Oh, it was Christmas!
I wanted Sherlock. I loved Sherlock. And the fact that he was difficult sexually was not something I saw as a big problem. Either I would manage to show him at some point how wonderful it is to enjoy physical love with ones partner. Or, if it really turned out that there was no room for that in his life, I would settle for cuddling, and otherwise, well, just settle for hand jobs in the shower for the next forty years. Admittedly, those with the thought of him were quite ... overwhelming. So there you have it.
He was far too flashed by the fact that he was the lover of the great criminal Moriarty that it simply didn't occur to him to cause trouble in any way. On the contrary, he wanted to make me proud and show me that he was worth me.
I read it.
I looked at his face, it was bright red, he was embarrassed, and yet he too seemed to enjoy the situation.
Then he turned to me and said:
I had "caught" him doing it one day when I came home from duty at Sarah's surgery. He was sitting in his armchair reading a book called "Sun, Moons and Planets".
John, however, shook his head vigorously.
Afterwards, I logged out and logged back in as "John Watson", covering my tracks.
At that point, I lost my temper. I only saw red.
It was quiet in the swimming pool. Only Sherlock's footsteps could be heard. Slowly, searching, waiting.
"So what happened next?"
The taxi driver had now seen me, but it didn't matter, because he didn't know that I, the unassuming companion of Sherlock Holmes, was Moriarty. Sherlock he knew, of course, because I had sent him photographs.
And finally he voiced his suspicions to Mrs Hudson.
"Yes?
I took a deep breath.
When he regained consciousness, he was sprawled on the sofa. Lestrade sat in the armchair opposite him, still bewilderment in his gaze, and held a glass of an amber liquid in his hands, trembling slightly.
Every hair on the back of his neck immediately stood up, his whole body on edge, ready to fight or flee, while his hand reached for the gun.
"Good morning, John."
"You remember the menu I served that evening? I had already told everyone in the invitation what was going to be served. However, in the menu sent to your brother, I entitled the dishes quite normally what they were: Creamy pumpkin soup, rib roast with roast potatoes and vegetables, and for dessert, chocolate pudding. Well, I just didn't have the guts to tease your stiff brother..."
* * *
I turned around.
"Mrs. Hudson? How ... I mean, it can't be! Not Mrs. Hudson!"
"Oh, sorry, I don't have my phone here, must still have it in my coat pocket," Mike said.
I felt his head turn bright red.
I surrendered to his arms and enjoyed his tenderness, almost purring, and we cuddled for quite a while until he finally said
Molly Moriarty's smile was positively wolfish.
The whole lot.
So my little tool stayed with me for the time being.
But I can recognise Sherlock's steps.
Anyway.
"Don't worry, Molly. I'll manage all right. There may not be a criminal as brilliant as you, but there's still enough to keep me from getting bored."
"She was ... great. In her own way."
"I want an explanation," he said. "For months I believed you were dead. I suffered like a dog. And then you just show up here, making me think you're just a figment of my brain ... okay, all right, you may not have known that. But... damn... still... I believed you were dead for so long! And when you were here with me, why didn't you talk to me?! Jesus, Sherlock, I thought I was going completely mad!"
“Obviously, I can smell the detergent from here.”
Sherlock scoffs. “Let’s not get our hopes up.”
As per usual, they stumble up the stairs, giggling and groping. Feet catch on steps, hands help support, clothing is flung away, doors are pushed closed.
Part of John's unit hides out behind a pile of sandbags, everyone else finding shelter from the raining bullets elsewhere. John can't see a way to base before both sides run out of bullets or soldiers, and he doesn’t have confidence that he’ll be able to get everyone out unscathed.
Sherlock grabs at John’s hand and holds it tightly. John lets him.
Tamping down his panic, John swings his legs over the side of the bed and stands, quickly making his way toward the silent bathroom.
John squeezes Sherlock’s knee. “Alright. If you change your mind or need any help, just give a shout.”
When he opens his eyes he sees Ella standing in the doorway, smiling. Odd, he hadn’t heard the door open.
John has been in similar situations before, of course. Normally, though, he is helping the stranger along in the de-robing process with a mutually beneficial and expected outcome at the end. This, however, feels infinitely more awkward yet much more intimate than any of his previous dalliances.
“About what I want.”
The sheets are divine, he’s pleasantly sleepy, the room smells like them. Nothing could be better.
He pours the soup into a mug and heats it up in the microwave, popping a spoon in when it’s warmed. He grabs a sleeve of saltine crackers from the counter as he walks by.
“Don’t bother.”
John twists the man’s arm behind his back, a muffled scream coming out of his mouth. John ignores it.
John stands there and stares, catching his breath, waiting for his brain to catch up with the words he just heard. After a moment, he starts chuckling, the ridiculousness of the situation almost hysterical. Combined with the adrenaline crash, John can’t help but laugh at his mad man.
John continues to stand there, staring at Sherlock’s back. “I...okay? Wait, no, no.”
Sometimes, John thinks about Sherlock while he's staring up at the Afghan sky, the stars twinkling brightly in the night. He almost doesn't believe his memories, that a man like Sherlock had actually been swept into his life, however briefly.
Sherlock pulls away slightly to look at John. John loosens his grip but keeps his arms around him. They gaze at each other in the dimness.
The door makes nary a sound as it swings open, revealing the sparsely furnished bedsit within.
“Do you want my help getting undressed?”
“You don’t look too far from it either, mate.”
John stops rambling, looking rather embarrassed.
John’s hand, too. Encompassing his own. The rough callouses scratch against Sherlock’s skin.
At first, he thinks someone’s pushed him over. But then he sees the blood.
John checks on Sherlock three times while he’s in the shower. Each time, Sherlock says he’s fine.
"Do you want me to...," Sherlock trails off.
He wordlessly perches on the edge of the mattress and coaxes Sherlock’s arm from under the blankets. Sherlock lets him, watching him with tired eyes.
