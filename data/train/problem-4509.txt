Cas was scared to outright reject him, because he thought Dean would throw a tantrum like a toddler who hears the word "No" for the first time.
"Better, now that you're here," Charlie says with an exaggerated wink in Dean’s direction, thankfully completely oblivious to the disaster unfolding itself in Cas’ mind.
They have spoken a total a 45 words this year - not that Cas is counting - and still Cas has been able to make an absolute fool of himself.
She hugs Dean and punches Cas' shoulder as a goodbye and just like that, she's gone, leaving a flustered Cas and a silent Dean behind.
He can tell, because Dean's fingers are curled into fists and the unhappy scowl hasn't left his face since they walked out of the class room.
If Dean had to take a guess, he'd say that this is the first time in over half a year that Cas has gone out.
He keeps scanning the faces of his fellow students in the hallways, wondering which one of them is the mysterious poet.
"Well if it isn't my Queen," he exclaims and bows exaggeratedly before sweeping Charlie up in a hug despite the fact that her eyes are puffy and her nose is running.
"He might not act like it, but your behavior hurt him and it brought some stuff back up he has fought very hard to overcome and I will not let him go through it again."
He's always worried that no one will come and now that it's actually happening, it feels even worse than he could've imagined.
"Sam informed me about the custom to play practical jokes on one another on 1 April. Even though I now know that this is a quite common tradition, I assure you that I was unaware of it. Please, Dean, I didn't know."
They have been friends for almost a decade Cas realizes and his heart aches at the thought of losing Dean.
"You are amazing," Dean whispers and for a moment his eyes flicker to Cas' lips, "You are kind and passionate and incredibly smart and I wish I'd had the courage to talk to you sooner. I mean really talk to you. Back when we were in school I chickened out every time I tried."
"Well dear, if you can't stand the heat, get out of hell," Rowena quips from next to Cas and not for the first time today he wonders what kind of witchcraft is responsible for her being completely unaffected by the inhuman temperatures.
Cas’ eyes follow the movement of Dean’s tongue and he’s momentarily distracted from his speech before he realizes what he’s doing and continues.
The act alone feels forbidden, like a massive invasion of privacy and he looks around guiltily as if anybody bearing witness could tell this notebook isn't his just from the way it lies in Cas' hands.
Cas puts his one of his hands over Dean's who are still covering his wounds in a desperate attempt to still the blood.
When Cas figured out that Dean was in love with him, his first instinct was talking to Sam, since Dean obviously cannot be trusted to act like an adult.
"I'm sorry for going off on you like that, I guess I can be a little overprotective sometimes," she says and the shadow that crosses her face makes Cas wonder what she's thinking about.
Dean knows they didn't do it on purpose. Balthazar and Meg probably overestimated Cas's drinking abilities, since their own are quite impressive.
He's been looking forward to it all month and even though both Balthazar and Meg cancelled on him shortly after he texted them about his plans.
"What's wrong?" Cas asks in what is probably an attempt to whisper and reaches up to poke Dean's cheek. He lets out a delighted chuckle when the soft flesh gives in and turns white under his touch.
"Sorry, man. We can go back inside if you're too cold, I just thought it would be nice to actually hear a word the other's saying."
"What? What is it?," he asks, worried that his silent stargazing reminded Dean of what a weirdo he was in Highschool and wondering if he's looking for a polite way to excuse himself to return to the mansion's living room.
Charlie nodded, not seeming surprised. Then her face lit up and Cas could actually see the metaphorical light bulb going on above her head.
"Take a seat, I'll be right back," Cas said, gesturing vaguely in the direction of his couch as he walked through the living room, heading straight for the kitchen.
The cool air makes Cas shiver, but he is grateful to have escaped the overheated living room. He's even more grateful when Dean steps closer to rub his arms in an attempt to keep him warm.
The mixtape is dark against the brightness of the snow and now that he's looking at his own scratchy handwriting it seems like a very childish idea.
To his surprise, he does not feel any of the explosive anger Castiel and Sam were afraid of. All he feels his shame and humiliation.
"I'm sorry this is no excuse and of course you don't care about why I broke into your apartment and we don't really no each other and ..."
He considered turning the light on, but decided he was too tired to make that effort and instead began pulling his shirt off.
"I want to give the people a voice who don't feel like they will ever be heard. I want to help them let the world know that they're here and that their opinions are valid and that they deserve to be acknowledged. That their point of view has to be considered, because I want us to live in a society that serves everyone and not just a few privileged people. I want to shine a light on issues in our political system and the way we treat each other in our everyday lives. I want to somehow make the world a better place, if only a little."
"Today I don't," Castiel says and a sad smile appears on his face as he relives memories long gone, "I used to live Christmas. It was my favorite holiday as a kid. I was the first to bring out the decorations, I stayed up all night trying to catch Santa ... my brother and I even laid a few traps, but the only thing we ever caught was the cat."
"Hey Dean!" is all Cas can hear before the door slams shut behind her and now his face is reddening for reasons entirely unrelated to the heat.
Another breathless laughter escaped his lips and he opened his arms, still gazing at the sky that was wide open for him in return.
"Heya Cas, long time no see," the voice next to him is warm and deep and that's enough for Cas to lift his head and smile.
He knows Cas is interested in mythology and poetry, but Dean has no clue about either one of these topics.
"You're a lifesaver," she says as her arms come around him and it's only when Dean relaxes into her embrace that Cas realizes how tense the other man had been.
His fingers twitch and for a second it looks like he is reaching out to take Cas' hand, but then he lets his hands fall to the side and turns around without saying a word, his face already hardening again.
He's about to start looking for Charlie to say his goodbyes when he sees Cas on the couch, clearly having crossed the line from tipsy to full on drunk.
"You are sooo pretty," Cas tells him with the blatant honesty only drunk people and children can get away with.
He has no idea what Dean usually eats, but he bought so much food that it's damn near impossible that he won't like at least some of it.
"Tell me about it," is all Dean hears before Ash drags a tipsy Jo through the door, who waves at him, completely unbothered by Ash's panic.
"Not much, ya know," he says. "Trying to figure out what I want. Internships here, some unsalaried work there. Can't really leave town with Mom and Sammy here, but I'll figure something out. College seems kinda off the table right now, but I'm sure there's something out there for me."
He won't have to think about how much time has passed between touches, won't have to ask for how long he can allow himself to linger in Cas' arms when they hug.
"They left some time ago." With a dramatic sigh, Cas slumps against Dean's shoulder who is trying not to react to the contact.
"This was not at all what my behavior was about. I didn't mean to make him feel judged or belittled. That was never my intention.
Cas used to have a crush on him when they were in high-school, but he wouldn't be surprised if Dean didn't remember him.
He was loading the dishwasher now, punctuating each word by shoving glasses into the machine like they had personally offended him.
His job may not be all that exciting, but when his boss is not stressing him out, he quite enjoys being at work. He gets along with all of his coworkers and on slow days like today he's essentially being paid to hang out with his friends.
The moment Dean saunters into the room, Cas' brain locks up and he promptly decides to make good of his plan to hide in the bathroom.
"Once he's done with work, he is going to head over to us," Charlie looks at her phone again, "which should be in about thirty minutes."
Charlie's curse brings Cas back to the present, just in time to see a black beast of car coming to a halt on the side of the street. Despite only having seen it once, he recognizes it immediately. There is only one person he knows that drives a 1967 Chevrolet Impala and he has no idea how to react when said person crosses the street with a wide smile on his face and walks right towards him.
Rationally, Cas knows that these are just his insecurities talking and deep down, he doesn't even believe them.
Dean takes a steadying breath and before he can talk himself out of it hands the wrapped casket to Cas.
He probably thought he'd say the words, Dean would stare at him for a second, then call him out on it and then Cas would tell him that he found out about Dean's feelings, but unfortunately (and to no one's surprise) did not feel the same way, even though he very much valued Dean as a friend.
Unfortunately, Cas is not anywhere near her level of confidence, so he was left feeling weird and uncomfortable all evening, especially because it took Balthazar a grand total of five minutes before he ditched Castiel in favor of sticking his tongue down someone's throat.
"So," he asks, trying to finally move on to stable conversation ground that leaves no room for the weird in-between-silences they constantly stumble upon.
“Well I guess you would know,” Dean says when he’s finally caught his breath and Cas’ heart skips a beat.
There was a large wooden desk where paperwork was piling up, a shelf full of books and a truly gigantic bed that put the ratty mattress in Dean's own apartment to shame.
The sky is dark and starless, the clouds covering it in its entirety except for a small rift through which the moon peaks shyly.
Thankfully, he is not in the classroom yet, nobody is, it’s blessedly empty, giving Cas the opportunity to make plans on how to proceed further in his search for the poet.
There's a notebook on the floor beside Cas' usual desk when he enters the library. Its light brown leather blends in perfectly with the dirty beige of the floor, so he doesn't notice it until he slumps down on his favorite seat in the corner of the room and unceremoniously drops his bag on the ground right next to it.
"Tend to be a little awkward around new people," he concludes weakly, hoping the blush creeping up his cheeks goes unnoticed.
He wants to tell Dean that it's fine. That it's alright. That everything is going to be alright, but he doesn't know how.
However, not many people his age seem to share the sentiment and as much as he loves the holiday itself, there is one thing he has learned to despise over the years:
As much as he enjoys the prospect of seeing Charlie's way too handsome coworker, he's less than thrilled to be getting rigged into actually having to participate in whatever ridiculous holiday activities Charlie has in store for all of them, let alone having to talk to Castiel.
There is no trace of emotion in the low rumble of his voice, but Dean nearly sinks to his knees, because why on earth does his embarrassment need to be drawn out even longer.
Maybe the idea to get blackout drunk with Sam and Charlie in celebration had not been as good as it had seemed at the time.
"Are you using your last joker for the year, Red?," he asks, causing Cas to blink at him in confusion.
"He's going to love it," Charlie said, sensing his panic and running a hand up and down his back in a soothing motion.
"Hate to say it, but I agree with super-nerd over here," Meg says, shooting a death glare to the useless ventilator beside her, whose meek effect is downright pathetic. "I don't think I'm able to survive this much longer."
His heart is racing like its being chased by the devil himself and maybe it is. Maybe death is reaching for him and hell already made its claim.
His throat is dry as a desert, but he has no idea how to explain himself, to defend himself, so he waits with bated breath for her next words.
The guy could've just given him a weird look, ordered his coffee and been on his merry way, instead of being completely unresponsive.
He clung to the handrail as he tried to make his way upstairs, but had to pause multiple times to catch his breath and because the ground beneath him was shifting.
"I agree," Charlie nodded, "but this is Dean we're talking about. If he doesn't want to tell you, he won't, and the more you push him, the more determined he will become to not say anything."
And for just a minute Cas allows himself to bask in the feeling of loving and being loved in return.
"You could always take your shirt off," Charlie shrugs nonchalantly, making Cas bump his leg against his desk. He bites back a curse as pain shoots through his knee, trying to be as quiet as possible, but judging by the smug look on Charlie's face she knows exactly what the mental image of a shirtless Dean does to him.
Dean can't say which brother was more disappointed when he called Sam to break the news to him that they won't see each other today, but the voice in the back of his head telling him how John was never there for Christmas either, did nothing to ease the pain of being apart for the first time ever on Christmas Eve.
Dean shakes his head a little, forcing his thoughts away from whatever the hell that was he just thought, and plasters a lazy smile on his face.
Dean is about to add something, but luckily the bell announces another customer so he is spared from making a fool of himself.
Knows that whenever Dean reaches for his hand or squeezes his shoulder or kisses his forehead or buries his face in the crook of Cas' neck, it is him saying "I love you" in whatever way he can.
Watching Dean and Charlie share a smile, before they both get to work, seeing the familiarity in the way they move around each other and the fond look on Dean's face when Charlie flops down on her chair with a dramatic sigh, makes him feel even worse about the whole misunderstanding.
His apartment building was not far away anymore, just down the street, but it took him an embarrassingly long time to arrive at the front door.
"I'm sure, Cas has better things to do on a Friday night than to hang out with the guy who's just been stood up by his best friend,"
"I know, I know. The two are literally the sweetest human beings on this planet and believe me when I tell you that I feel like shit and you're allowed to think I am a terrible person, but I got so angry when I saw them."
On the bright side the bartender - who turned out to be a good friend of Charlie as well - complimented Cas for his armor and smiled at him whenever their eyes met across the room over the course of an evening.
"Is it alright if I take a moment to decide?," he asks as if Dean is going to kick out a paying customer.
"It's just that I uh ... I came out to my Dad today and I was really worried about his reaction, but then it didn't go over half bad and I decided to celebrate with my best friend and my little brother and ...," Dean cut himself off.
He nudges Cas playfully to show him, he's only teasing, and then Cas smiles back, and his eyes light up, and why does this feel like an accomplishment?
"Sure am," she declares, smiling so wide, it must hurt her face., "and it's totally gonna be worth it! This girl is special, I can feel it."
They sit in silence after that. Cas is looking at the sky again. The clouds have broken, the stars are finally visible and not for the first time is Cas enchanted by their infinity.
"Charlie, " Cas said, a smile beginning to spread over his face, growing wider and wider the more she elaborated, "you are an amazing human being/genius and I will love you until the day I die."
Charlie next to him just rolls her eyes and fixes her elf hat with a grin that is entirely too pleased for his liking.
And I knew that, all of that before being allowed that glimpse into your soul, just from seeing you interact with everyone around you.”
"It's still summer, you know. After this, it’s no more spontaneous trips, no more blowing me off for dates. Nothing like that. So, you sure about this?,” Dean continues and Cas decides he has officially lost track of the conversation.
"Do I want presents?," Dean repeated, disbelieving like he'd never been asked that question before. For a short moment he looked at Cas with wide-eyed confusion as if he couldn't figure out why this of all things was the matter Cas focused on, before his expression closed off and he returned to his task of moving their dirty dishes from the sink to the washer, his grip on the plates so tight Cas feared the porcelain would shatter.
Maybe Cas thought confessing his love to Dean on April Fools' Day would make him realize how ridiculous an idea it was to entertain the thought of them being together.
"But not only is she absolutely breathtaking, she's wearing a t-shirt that has Chewbacca stepping out of the Tardis printed on it."
"Cassie!," a shout interrupts his musings and before he can even open his eyes, an arm is flung over his shoulder and he finds himself very close to the party's host, "I'm so glad you could make it. I was afraid you'd spend the night elsewhere."
His pie is long eaten and what's left of the tea must be cold, so Dean decides to check up on him, before the afternoon rush.
He spots Garth and his girlfriend Bess - dressed in matching werewolf costumes - and sees Jesse and Cesar who can't seem to take their eyes off of each other.
It does not help that Charlie's stories -which often feature Dean- paint the picture of a funny, open-minded and caring man.
Damn it. This is not about his feelings. This is about him apparently being such an asshole that his best friend believes him incapable of having in depth conversations without blowing up. He takes a deep breath, trying to keep his emotions at bay that are already on the way of becoming a raging thunderstorm in his mind. He forces another smile onto his face.
"Her name is Kara, we've been texting back and forth almost every day, I think she might be the love of my life and today," she says with another dramatic exhale, spreading her arms wide as they leave the office building and step onto the parking lot, "is the day of days. Tonight we're finally going out."
Another text message. He expects it to be a reply from Garth but instead it's Anna telling him she has to cover the night shift, because her co-worker did not show up. She profusely apologizes even though it's not her fault and Cas is quick to assure her of that, but it stings nonetheless.
"Hey welcome to Espresso Patronum, what can I ...", the words catch in his throat when he sees who exactly made his way into the shop today.
It's the middle of the night, people are beginning to leave, and Dean sits unmoving on the couch with his heart so full, it should be bursting.
All he could tell from the poems is that the stranger is a boy his age with green eyes who has a little brother, a resilient mother and no sense of self-worth.
"I don't even know what point I'm trying to make here," she sighs, "I just thought you'd get along - still do actually - and no matter how much I think about it, I just can't come up with a single reason why you wouldn't even give him a chance," she shrugs helplessly, but when Cas opens his mouth to explain himself, to apologize, to tell her what was actually going on -as embarrassing as it is for him-, she simply holds up a hand.
"Because I know you will and I can do very well without all the shit that goes along with that. I don't need presents, I don't need to be the center of attention and I sure as hell don't need the fake friendliness that comes with the entire thing."
"I meant it when I said I wanted to get along from now on," he says, congratulating himself for stringing together an entire sentence.
"What's the urgency about?," he asks as he grabs his bag from under his desk and walks up to where is friend is waiting for him with one foot already out the door.
Besides I only know what I want, because I didn't have unwanted opinions forced upon me every step I took. You've always gotten input from everybody around you. They all seemed to have tons of ideas about what you should do with your life. It's no wonder you struggle finding your own voice, when you have a choir of other people's thoughts drowning it out."
His eyes are alight with joy, his fingers are drumming on the steering wheel and the smile on his face seems almost unconscious. Like he doesn't even know it's there.
He risks a glance at Dean, who looks unbothered (and beyond gorgeous in the retreating afternoon sun, as his brain unhelpfully supplies) and prays the two friends won’t start fighting over this.
"Yeah, alright, you certainly had more than enough tonight," Dean deflects while heaving Cas into a sitting position. He opens the water bottle and hands it to Cas, who takes it into both hands and chugs half of it in one go. Normally, Dean would tell him to take it easy, but he's just thankful that he doesn't have to fight Cas on this one.
Cas immediately starts repeating his speech in his brain, trying to come up with something he phrased wrong that might have hurt or offended Dean, but a gentle hand on his shoulder brings his spiraling thoughts to a screeching halt.
There is just no way someone as confident and intelligent and beautiful as Dean Winchester would see Cas that way.
"You know, if I'm boring you, you could've just told me," she says teasingly and Cas rolls his eyes at her.
two nearly strangers sitting beside each other in a setting where it is not only socially acceptable, but required to not talk to each other. Hopefully this way he can get used to Dean's presence enough to be able to talk to him afterwards - maybe even over dinner, if he can muster up the courage to ask.
"Talk?," Dean asks incredulously, "You made it perfectly clear last time that you've got nothing to say to me."
Their eyes meet and not for the first time Cas is enraptured by the beauty of the man in front of him and the way he lays bare his vulnerability without fear, just by looking at Cas.
The words stopped Dean dead in his tracks and he turned around to stare at Cas with utter disbelief.
Apparently they both like oversized clothes, because Dean's washed out black hoodie is so big, he nearly drowns in it.
When he can no longer stand the silence, he chances a glance up to Cas's face and his heart leaps, when Cas looks at him with a soft smile that jumpstarts his courage enough to blurt out the next words.
Instead her eyes are glued to the glass of water on her desk like she seriously considers pouring it all over herself.
Charlie and Gilda have been together for years. They started dating in college but took jobs in different cities and despite their best efforts could not find a way to move closer again. It has caused Charlie a lot of hard break over the years and not seldom did she talk about quitting her job, finding one in a different field and moving across the country to be close to her girlfriend again.
Cas is about to shoot his resolution not to pry into the wind, when Dean finally turns around to face him.
"How could you have known that  my manners and capability to function like a human would leave me in his presence."
Thankfully the end of the queue saves Dean from having to come up with an excuse and he mockingly bows before Charlie.
"She's the best," he can't help the pride slipping into his words as he looks his best friend who is giving out papers to her employees, "The queen of a kingdom she created herself."
"You don't have to go," Cas adds, more quietly. "You can come in if you want, I just wasn't expecting you, that's all."
"Dean," Cas said, blue eyes pleading in the puppy dog way he knew Dean could not resist, "Come on, it's your birthday. It's supposed to be your special day. Your friends doing something nice for you is not fake friendliness, it's them celebrating the fact that you were born. Please, just tell me. Let me do something nice for you."
Even though Cas is the one who just revealed the feelings he'd kept secret for years, Dean asks the question like he can't believe Castiel would agree.
"Everybody I invited cancelled over the last few hours, so I was not expecting anybody to show up," Cas says, gesturing towards his sweatpants.
He buried his nose in the crook of Cas' neck and Cas could feel Dean smile against his skin as he whispered: "How did you know?"
Yet the only thing his brain is able to focus on is the fact that Dean's shoulder is still touching his.
Now more then ever Dean wants to know why this man looks so sad at what's supposed to be the happiest season of all.
"Never," Meg snorts from the other side of their table group, "when I last filed a complaint about it, the answer I received was and I quote 'We will tend to the problem as soon as time and resources allow it' which translates to 'We will let you stew in your own sweat until it's winter and the problem doesn't need to be addressed anymore.'
With the fear of rejection evaporating, Dean finds himself spilling all the things he had to hold in for so long.
Maybe that's her really polite way of saying 'I saw you ogle my friend, try to be less creepy this time'?
Cas' plans for the evening actually consisted of doing his laundry and vacuuming his apartment, but that's so lame, he wouldn't even admit it in front of Charlie, let alone Dean.
"I love you," Cas says and his smile is blinding and infectious and Dean can feel his own face light up as he takes a step forward to embrace his best friend.
So he just sits there, stiff as a board, willing his fingers to resist the urge of brushing away a strand of hair that is clinging to Cas's forehead.
He waits next to the exit for he to finish up her speech, before he grabs her by the wrist and pulls her out of the shop, for once not caring what the others think of him.
He was young and free and relieved and alive and himself, finally himself and when Dean looked up at the stars that shone down upon him, he felt like everything was going to be okay.
Dean does not dare to move because he knows the bubble will burst as soon as he does so much as breathe too hard.
They walk beside each other in silence which is not unusual for them, but something about it doesn't sit right with Cas and by the time they arrive at Dean's house, his stomach is in knots. He tries to come up with something, anything to break the silence between them, but Dean simply unlocks the front door and just like that he's out of reach again.
Their exchanges that night had been limited, but they were enough to intrigue Cas, making him want to know everything about the fascinating man that is Dean Winchester.
Cas' voice was low and still rough from sleep and even though it was entirely inappropriate given the situation, Dean found himself liking the commanding tone a little too much.
Since half the city is invited anyway, Balthazar has the largest -and only- firework spectacle of Starsbridge.
"That's uhm ... that's good to know," he choked out, banging himself on the chest, trying to force the air back into his lungs.
"No deathbed speeches. You're staying. You will live. And you will come home," Dean has stopped crying. His voice is clear and authoritative and he won't take no for an answer.
"Wait!," Cas says. His voice is too loud, bouncing off the walls of the empty hallway and Dean freezes immediately.
Cas looks genuinely confused at his reaction and a bitter laugh escapes Dean's lips before he can stop it. It sounds hollow even in his own ears. His best friend is a much better actor than Dean gave him credit for and it makes him question every single moment they have spent together.
They barely know each other and no matter how connected he feels to Dean, especially since discovering the notebook, the other boy does not share the sentiment.
He had never thought about it until now, since the way Charlie interacted with him hadn't changed, but his weird behavior must've come up.
He's pretty sure Cas won't move anytime soon, but he'd rather not risk it. Walking to the kitchen which has already emptied quite a bit, he realizes that he has to figure out a way to get Castiel home.
"In fact this," he gestures at his own face and the sadness of its features, "should not be your concern and I'm sorry it came up to ruin your night."
"Sorry about that, didn't mean to dump that on you, man. Let's go find your friends, before I ruin your night any further."
A wave of noise and hot air hits him when he walks into the living room and even though he arrived fairly early, there are people everywhere.
"Hey!" she exclaims, trying to swat his hands away, but she's a little unsteady on her feet, so her success is limited to Ash rolling his eyes.
There's a short moment of silence between them which is unsettling because it never happens when they talk.
Dean closes his eyes for a moment, willing his feelings away into the box in his head titled "deal with it never", before he puts on his best smile and turns around.
Dean doesn’t answer and now that he has said his part, Cas ist starting to feel self-conscious again.
If Dean were standing next to them, he'd tell Charlie to pick up her jaw from the floor, but he's gonna play it nice today, even though she would absolutely deserve that embarrassment for keeping him from his couch.
As if he wouldn’t do anything in his power to offer Dean the happiness he doesn’t think he deserves.
Castiel gets another clap on the back and with that his friend is gone and he stands alone in the giant entryway of Balthazar's mansion.
Stepping into the late afternoon sun after a day spent in the office always has a sense of liberation to it.
He wipes them off with the back of his hand and all Cas can do is watch helplessly as the boy he loves falls apart in front of him.
"But this is just cruel, man. I know … I hope it wasn't your intention to turn this into some sort of payback and I am sure in Sammy's giant brain this was the right thing to do, but this hurts. Okay? This fucking hurts, because it's fine if you don't want to be with me, but telling me you do only to take this away from me …," his voice trembles and he feels pathetic.
So instead of greeting the man like a normal human being would've, all Cas had done was look at him, awestruck by his kind eyes and bright smile, that had wavered under Cas' stare until it disappeared. Cas would probably have died from embarrassment, hadn't his brain been entirely preoccupied with processing the beauty in front of him.
"Oh yes, of course", the man gives Dean a sheepish smile and it is so unexpected and adorable that Dean nearly melts on the spot.
"Gilda is here," she finally says and the happiness that sneaks its way into her voice at the mention of her long-distance girlfriend makes Cas smile as well.
"Thanks Cas," Dean's eyes are shining, but with gratitude rather than tears and Cas takes pride in being the one enabling that change. “I’m really glad we met today.”
Had he not been so keen on stressing that Cas should "dress up", Cas would never in a million years gone for what he ended up wearing.
He nods under her expectant look and tries to let the tension drain from his shoulders. It's not even a real Christmas party just a meet-up for Charlie to announce her annual holiday game, but somehow that makes the whole thing even weirder. No matter what Charlie says, it still doesn't feel right for him to be here. He's neither working full nor half-time and helping out here and there does not make him part of the tight-knit working family Charlie built up. However it would be even more awkward to leave now, especially since his best friend is making her way through the small crowd of her employees towards the counter. She climbs up on it without hesitation and beams at the people gathered around her.
His cheeks are burning with embarrassment and shame and he keeps his eyes lowered, unable to look at Charlie, not wanting to see her reaction.
"She really is a force of nature isn't she," rumbles a deep voice right next to Dean's ear and it takes all his will power to suppress the shiver running down his spine. Castiel is standing behind him and they are painfully close to each other. Considering who engrossed Dean has been in Charlie's speech, it's no wonder he hasn't noticed Cas's arrival, but now he can't stop thinking about how long he's been standing there.
It's Cas' favorite type of weather and he closes his eyes and enjoys the breeze ruffling his already unruly hair. Moments like this should last forever, but he knows it's just the calm before the storm and that the two of them should probably head home before it starts raining.
"I am sorry," he says and he means it, "I am sorry I made you feel like you could not talk openly to me. I am sorry for being unpredictable and I am sorry for being mad at you all these times, when you didn't deserve it."
There is nothing he can do about it though, except to let out his frustration by furiously wiping the counter until someone behind him clears his throat and distracts him from his own misery.
"That's the point. I was never going to say a fucking word about it and you've forced me to give him a 'present from the heart', really? Did you set this whole thing up just for me to have a heart broken by a man way too good for me?!"
"We could throw him a "It's probably not your birthday"-party", " she announced excitedly, "Invite a couple of friends, get him some gifts, pie - of course - and just dedicate one random day to him. So what if we don't know his actual birthday? We can still celebrate him, right?"
It's not like it matters now whether he applies her customer policy now or not, since he probably made the guy so uncomfortable that he's never coming back to the coffee shop ever again.
"Jus' a little," Cas slurs. His head still rests in Dean's lap, and he does not look like he wants change that any time soon. Dean knows he should get up and get Cas some water, but he can't bring himself to interrupt the moment.
Despite the fact that they have not even noticed him yet, let alone know what he is reading, he can feel himself going bright red.
He can see Meg and Balthazar, dressed as Joker and Harley Quinn - in that order - knocking back shots, and next to them sits Castiel, who already looks a little out of it, even though there are only two empty beer bottles in front of him and he isn't participating in their game.
"You hungry?," Dean asks, but his voice is gruff and lacks the enthusiasm he normally shows when it comes to food.
It was an offense to all the hard work Cas had put into his own costume and the fact that besides him no one at the party had made even the resemblance of an effort successfully killed the sad remainders of his excitement.
He thinks about lingering and trying to talk to the stranger for a little bit, but then again the guy probably isn't up for smalltalk with some random barista who has acted nothing but weird in his presence.
The sound of porcelain on wood gets his attention and he thanks Dean with a smile that makes his stomach flip in the best way possible.
This seems to be the wrong question, because Dean ducks his head and the easy smile on his face grows sheepish as he shrugs.
It is not the strong jawline or the man's pink lips that are slightly chapped from the cold, even though his gaze lingers on them longer than it should.
Or maybe he should just leave early. He's got enough overtime as it is and it's not like he's going to get any more work done today.
It was not entirely unexpected, since they are both not really the type for movie nights, but it still hurt a little to know that they prefer to spend their time elsewhere.
“Don’t ever think of your feelings as pathetic,” Cas orders. Dean will probably never talk to him again after this - too weirded out to even be in the same room as Cas - but he needs to get his point across.
He is wearing a tan trench coat that looks old and well-worn and can't possibly keep him warm at this time of the year, but the suit he wears underneath it speaks volumes about the kind of money he must have in his bank account, because the way it fits his body is way too flattering for it not to be tailored.
Dean is practically vibrating with excitement and jealousy worms its way into Cas' heart at the thought of Dean going out on a double date with Charlie and Kara and some faceless girl or guy on his arm, who laughs at his jokes and manages to make intelligent conversation instead of being a stuttering, stumbling mess.
"Dean won't tell me his birthday and I am going insane over it. He insists he doesn't want anything, that I should just quit bugging him - which I have been doing consistently over the last few week - because the whole concept is overrated and stupid, but I don't believe him. I don't believe he believes that. He threw you the most gigantic Moondoor themed party for your 21st birthday and he went out of his way to get Sam a signed copy of this weird super rare criminology book and he had the perfect day planned for mine … I simply don't understand why he won't let me do the same for him. Or at least tell me the damn date. I'm his boyfriend for crying out loud, I should know his fucking birthday."
It's Halloween, November is approaching with lightning speed - technically it's already there - and that means the next weeks are probably gonna be hell, but right now, in this very moment, all Dean feels is happiness.
"I'll tell you what I want, Cas," Dean said, "On that particular day, like any other goddamn day of the year, I wanna go to class, go to work, and go home where I make dinner for us and then sit on the couch watching Star Wars or Dr. Sexy or some brainless reality show, before going to bed. That's it. Perfect birthday for me. Wouldn't dream of wanting anything else."
"Dude, you've been here all day. In all these hours you've ordered a cup of coffee, some tea and "whatever pastry I recommend", which is not all that much for the time you spent here. So obviously something's going on," Dean explains and yup, he's being intrusive, but the man definitely has some baggage and if there's even a little chance Dean can take some of it off him, then he will.
Unlike other kids, he did not care about the candy -even though he ate his fill every year- what was most important to him was dressing up.
However, racking his brain over it is not going to solve anything, so he steels himself for a fallout and follows Dean upstairs.
"I can see that," he says, "seriously how did you guys sit through this for a week? I've been here for two minutes and I'm already sweating."
While he is grateful that Charlie has forgiven him, he knows he still has to talk to Dean and it's not going to be pleasant.
Cas reaches out a hand, hovering above Dean's shoulder before he lets it drop into his lap again like he is uncertain if Dean will allow his touch.
It was Friday, January 24th and Cas' nerves were killing him and Dean would most certainly be more than happy to help out, should they fail in their attempt.
She slams her palm against her sweaty forehead, but immediately draws back when she remembers its state. Momentarily distracted she looks down on her hand in disgust, before rubbing it against her pants.
It's not like he ever thought he stood a chance with Dean but he has never felt so far out of someone's league as he does now, realizing how pathetic he's going to look as soon as he opens his mouth and informs Dean about what happened.
"I know, I know," Charlie grinned, "You can tell me again how awesome I am once we're done coming up with the most amazing party plan known to mankind."
"But I am not brave enough to tell them. I know, it should not be such a big deal nowadays and that it's not the eighties anymore. Hell, I could ask you to marry me in a few years and no one could do anything about it, but the mere thought of telling everybody at school makes me want to throw up and I am scared, Cas. I am so fucking scared of what will happen if they find out and for that I am sorry."
The music is loud and absolutely terrible and Dean wonders for what must be the hundredth time this evening why on earth he let Charlie talk him into this.
Dean shook his head, the look of love and affection in his eyes setting off a swarm of butterflies in Cas' stomach.
The silence between them is heavy and Sam doesn't say anything for so long that Dean worries he's hung up on him.
The smile that graced Dean's face when he opened the door and saw his friends waiting for him put the sun to shame in its brightness and Cas nearly teared up when Dean threw himself into his arms.
Dean stares at his hands hovering above the counter and pointedly does not look at the customer. Charlie would tear him a new one if she knew it, but he can't make eye contact now or he is going to die from embarrassment.
They are too large and the dark grey fabric has witch-hat wearing guinea pigs printed all over it. Gabriel got them for him as a joke but Cas ended up loving them.
"Oh thank fuck," Meg groans. She has tied her usually perfectly curled brown hair into a messy bun on top of her head and presses the back of her hands against her red cheeks.
Cas follows him across the street and it's not until he's sitting besides Dean in the passenger seat that he registers what's wrong about this statement.
He drops his hands and looks at Cas again to make sure his friend knows he means every word of his apology.
At first he tries to shrug it off, but under her scrutinizing look, Cas has no other choice, but to nod in defeat.
It's low and pleading and almost inaudible against the rage of war around them, but all of sudden every word is crystal clear to Cas.
He does not say anything else, simply hopes that Dean's attention will turn back to Charlie, before Cas can make a fool of himself again.
The buzz of his phone brings Cas back to the present and he places the bowl of popcorn on the table in front of the couch to look at it.
Castiel chuckles and Dean smiles imagining the stoic man in front of him as a child, wide-eyed and excited.
He carries the notebook everywhere and even though guilt gnaws on him whenever he opens it, he is captivated by the words, by the story the stranger tells.
Because his hands are gentle, even though they have carried a weapon every single day for the past year.
Charlie’s bright and bubbly nature is the perfect contrast to Cas’ own sometimes closed-off behavior.
"What? Yes, yes I am done, thank you very much," the man stumbles over his words as if he did not expect to be spoken to, which - again - is decidedly not adorable.
He is aware of some of Castiel's likes and dislikes, but Charlie said they were supposed to gift something from the heart.
Thankfully, there is no one there to judge but his consciousness when he gingerly opens the journal.
She looks like the only thing keeping her from bursting into tears is the dehydrated state of her body, but then her face lights up and all of a sudden she's grinning from ear to ear.
"I'm so glad everybody took the time to be here! I've asked for all of you to come here, since for this year's Christmas game I decided to do something different. It's not a game per se, but I thought it would be fun to have some Secret Santas running around here," Charlie turns around to grab something from behind the counter that turns out to be a small bag. Cheers errupt from crowd and she smiles.
"Dude," he grins when he looks down at his own watch, "it's half past twelve already. Ellen's gonna kill you!"
He behaves like it's his first day on the job considering how many stupid mistakes he already made and he prays that the man won't want to consume his food here, because Dean seriously needs some time to turn himself back into a functioning human being.
"I want that, too! I want to walk you to your locker, I want to hold your hand in class, I want to kiss you by the bleachers and I can't."
"That is amazing, Cas," Dean says, his voice sounding a little hoarse and when Cas looks at him his shoulders are hunched and his smile is no longer happy.
“I don’t think you’re pathetic,” he says sternly, “I believe you’re the exact opposite of pathetic. You are caring, selfless. You’re loving.
"Cas, you know you've become a good friend to me," Charlie begins and he hears the but coming before she even finishes speaking.
Then man is watching him with an unreadable expression and Dean begs the ground beneath him to open up and swallow him, because there is a beautiful, heartbroken man in front of him and with only one sentence he has managed to fuck up their encounter.
"I uhm," the words get stuck in his throat, so he clears it and tries again, desperately hoping that he does not look like he just got caught with his hand in the cookie jar,
Dean probably thinks he’s even more of a douchebag than after the stellar impression he made during their first meeting.
There is pain tearing through him, sharp and hot and ice cold and too much and he has to close his eyes against it.
Charlie gave him a look that told him she did not believe a word he was saying. He was saved by a young woman holding the door open for the two of them on her way out of the shop.
His answer is cut off by a gust of cool air and when he looks up, Dean has his arms raised in victory.
I did what I did not out of dislike," he sighs, burying his face in his hands as he forces the words out, "but because I was so awestruck by his beauty that I could neither speak nor take my eyes off him."
"I thought you didn't know what to do with me," Dean confesses, "not that I blamed you or anything. You were always so driven and focused and I behaved like a fumbling idiot every time I was near you."
Cas is so engrossed in studying the hardwood floor beneath his feet that he doesn’t hear the approaching footsteps, until someone comes to a halt beside him.
His lips are moving and it’s clear he's trying to communicate with Cas, but the music and noise around them keeps getting louder and Cas cannot understand a word he's saying.
"I am so sorry, Dean. I didn't realize how much this meant to you. You don't have to do this. I can be Cas's Santa and he'll never know what happened."
His friend is standing in the kitchen, but upon walking closer, Dean notices Andrea by his side and retreats back to the living room.
Somehow, they have managed to hoard a fuckton of booze and candy, and Dean has never been as thankful for his friends as he is now.
As much as he appreciates her teasing and her support, he still has not spoken to the man whose forgiveness he seeks and even though he wants nothing more than to explain himself, he has no idea how to do that.
Cas had stood in the same spot for another five minutes after they had driven off,  asking himself what he did to deserve such humiliation.
Charlie wordlessly holds up her hand and Dean high-fives her on his way out, leaving a flustered Cas and a laughing Meg behind.
“Where did you get this?”, he asks, voice barely more than a whisper, one hand reaching for the book. Cas notices the slight tremor in his fingers before they tightly close around the leather.
"We should get going soon, then. The earlier you’re there, the better your spot and it's a bit of a drive."
"You wanna tell me why you got so drunk, you didn't recognize your own apartment and started a strip tease in my bedroom?," Cas asked, shooting a teasing grin in Dean's direction who felt his face already heating up again.
But it's hard sometimes, being the only one who knows and he can't read Dean this time, doesn't know what upset him and why he's even more closed off than usual and it scares Cas more than he likes to admit.
Belatedly he realizes that Cas is still waiting for an answer, so he clears his throat and smiles awkwardly.
Sam was sitting on the couch next to Eileen, and he was constantly shooting knowing smiles in Cas' direction that were freaking him out, because they obviously meant that Sam knew how Dean would react to this (which was badly, of course, since Cas had overstepped his boundaries and everything was going to burn).
Which was quite often, because Cas simply could not stop staring, his eyes drawn to the man by something he could neither name nor explain.
His heart aches a little at the thought of Dean with someone else, but he’s more than willing to ignore that in favor of possibly becoming friends with Dean.
The grateful smile in her direction kept him from answering Charlie's question, and he walked directly towards their usual table just to defer the interrogation he knew was about to follow.
"So sorry buddy, but Bess and I can't come. She's been nauseated all day and her back is killing her. Fingers crossed that the twins won't continue being such trouble makers once they're here. Have fun today!"
Abruptly realizing he had raised his voice, Cas shot Charlie an apologetic look, before repeating more quietly: "I should know."
Under normal circumstances, Cas would love literature class, but with Dean in his immediate proximity, he has no chance to concentrate.
Most of his friends have good reasons for not being here, Cas knows that and he knows it's not their fault, but it still hurts.
"Cas!," Dean is loud and panicked and his whole body is shaking, but he doesn't stop his attempts to staunch the blood.
Thankfully Charlie had taken pity on the both of them by declaring that they really needed to get going and "See you tomorrow, Cas", before practically throwing herself into the passenger seat. Dean's goodbye had consisted of a half smile and an awkward "Nice to meet you", before he, too,  rescued himself into the car and drove off.
The elevator doors open and Charlie nearly jumps into the metal box before she turns back to Castiel, eyes wide and excited.
Cas smiles up at the darkness above him, closing his eyes to focus on the cold January wind that breezes over his cheeks and makes him shiver in the best way possible.
"It was never my intention to hurt you. I understand that you are going to need time to forgive me, however, I wanted you to know that I meant every word of what I said this morning.
Without Charlie as buffer, Cas has to be the one who carries - or at least actively participates in - the conversation which (as he has impressively proven over the course of every interaction he ever had with Dean) is quite the obstacle.
"Liquor courage," Dean says and puts his arm around Cas's waist who promptly slumps against him, proving his point.
Unbothered by Meg's demeanor, Charlie grabs her cell phone and skips out of the room, her flowy blouse billowing behind her.
He stared at Cas' sleep ruffled hair, the soft expression on his face and the shy smile tugging at the corner of his lips as he walked towards Dean.
By now Dean is looking a little choked up and Cas' smiles nervously wondering if his speech was too much. Apparently he still doesn’t really know how to talk to people when this is what he deems appropriate for a party conversation.
"It's okay, Cas. You couldn't have know," Charlie reassures him, "Don't beat yourself up for something you had no control over. Dean's like a big brother to me and I've known him for way too long, so I sometimes forget the effect he has on people. I should've warned you, knowing that he was gonna tick all your boxes."
Dean swallows harshly and Cas doesn't even dare protest the fact that Dean thinks his pain is an inconvenience, afraid the other man might stop talking entirely.
"Not really, no, " he answered truthfully, falling into step with her as she made a beeline for the coffee shop, and he meant it.  Everything was great, but  Dean withholding something as important as his birthday from him made him feel off.
"He would kill me if he knew I told you this, but I think it was pretty hard on him to get the cold shoulder from you, especially since you are my favorite coworker and I've told him a lot about you. To be honest, I kinda hoped you'd get along, since I was not exactly secretive about Dean either."
"That does not mean, you're allowed behind my counter. You're sick and you're going home, now," he says in a voice that leaves no room for argument.
"I know, " Cas said, "believe me, I know, but I have to do something. He deserves something nice, something that's just for him. I don't think he's ever really had that. Last week I brought him flowers and his eyes watered so quickly I thought he was having an allergic reaction. Turns out he's never received a gift, just because."
He knows that solution would not have made either of the girls happy, because Charlie loves her work almost as much as she loves Gilda and Gilda would never ask that of her, being in the very same situation.
"Oh," Cas says very slowly. He is slurring the words a bit, making his intoxicated state even more obvious.
For the first time on this shitty Christmas Day, genuine laughter escapes Dean's lips and the last bit of professionalism goes to hell when he watches Charlie failing to keep up an angry face.
He takes another step forward, bringing them closer still, bridging the distance until there is almost no space between them anymore.
Charlie had cracked up laughing, but Cas had smiled kindly and shook his hand, before helping him pick up the books even though his eyes had shone with amusement.
When Dean finally looks up, there are tears shimmering in his eyes and his voice is breaking, but he continues nonetheless.
"She wanted to surprise me since tomorrow is our anniversary, so she pulled some strings and now she's here and I am so happy I could scream because I really missed her and we thought we would not see each other until December, but she told me she got a job offer in a town just an hour away from here and she could start in January if she took it. This woman is crazy. Absolutely crazy and I'm so happy, Cas. I'm so happy and as much as I love you and hate to be
the paper reads in neat letters and Dean's heart leaps in his chest. This is both the best and worst thing that could have happened and once he's decided whether he should panic or celebrate, he'll give Charlie a piece of his mind about fixing what was supposed to be a procedure of
"I saw Bess and Garth kissing in the hallway right before I picked you up," he finally states and Cas' confusion must be mirrored on his face, because Dean helplessly shrugs with one shoulder.
But Cas has the excuse of being drunk - a sleepy drunk that is - while Dean is about as sober by now as he was when the party started.
He's about to return to the couch having decided on eating and moping as his activities for the night when the door bell rings.
When he opens his eyes again, Dean watches him from a few steps ahead with an unbearably soft expression on his face.
Their eyes lock, yet no words are spoken and Dean resists the urge to start nervous blabbering by clearing his throat.
Unfortunately not because he is excited for presents or because he is on his way to visit family for Christmas, but for the simple and annoying fact that he's at work.
He hates it when that happens, hates it, when things slow down and it feels like time is moving backwards instead of passing.
"God, I am so stupid, " he lets his hands drop to his sides again, shooting a crooked grin in Cas' direction whose expression has become unreadable,
Cas smiles. Knowing how much these news mean to her, he could not be mad at her for cancelling if he wanted.
His heart was beating too fast, his palms started sweating and he was nervous all of a sudden, while hope bloomed in his chest.
Correction: He sincerely hopes that Cas lives next door, because otherwise he's in for a real treat.
He was supposed to spend the day with Sam and his new girlfriend, but he got stuck with a double shift instead, because everybody had already called dibs on holiday or was miraculously sick this morning, so he won't be back in his shitty apartment until after closing time and by then it's gonna be to late to get to Palo Alto, even in a flying death trap he's forced to use if he wants to visit his little brother nowadays.
The “I love you” sits on the top of his tongue but it would be too much, too soon and Dean already looks like a deer caught in headlights.
Dean slowly exhales through his nose and lets his head fall back. He's looking up at the sky where tiny little snowflakes begin making their way down to him.
Before Charlie could even try to object he dropped the farce - and the laminated paper sheet, and let out a long-suffering sigh.
Normally Castiel has no interest in such gatherings, but most of his friends are going too and he does not want to celebrate the New Year with his parents - as much as he loves them.
"Of course I did, silly. You would've spent the rest of your life swooning over Cas and never made a move."
For a moment Dean considers walking over to him, but they don't really talk outside of the few classes they share, so it would probably be awkward.
"Not because it was inappropriate or anything," he backpedals quickly, inwardly cursing his choice of words.
The thing about Charlie's best friend is, that he is hands down the most attractive human being on the planet - at least in Cas' humble opinion.
His face burns at the thought of having to face Cas again after what just happened, but at least it's all out in the open now.
For the duration of the ten minute walk from his own apartment to Balthazar's he had felt strong and powerful and had really been looking forward to the night.
Despite her words, she looks disappointed and Cas desperately wants to tell her how wrong she is, even though he still struggles to figure out how the hell she interpreted the moon eyes he made at Dean as dislike.
"Come on Dean, don't you think you're being a little dramatic? You can remain anonymous if you choose to. This simply forces you to deal with your feelings, it doesn't mean you have to act on them, in fact it might help you to get over them. Give him a part of yourself and let go of it or take a risk and reveal yourself and your feelings to him."
"It's alright,"Cas says and wonders how many times he will say these words and how often he has said them already over the last year.
"That's not true," Charlie angrily whispers back and steps further into the store as if to prove her point, "I like my coworkers!"
"It's called exposure therapy, Dean. This is for your own good," she states as she pushes him through the door into the bookstore she works in.
Cas doubts that he'll be able to eat anything until whatever is going on is settled, so he simply shakes his head. A nod is his only answer and then Dean's making his way upstairs like everything is fine, leaving a bewildered Castiel behind.
"But do you want presents?," Cas asked, voice soft in the way he knew would get Dean to turn around and face him.
They have the house to themselves which is not unusual either since John Winchester is rarely ever home and Sam tries to spend as little time there as possible. Cas knows he is at soccer practice right now, but he finds himself longing for the younger Winchester's presence which never fails to lighten Dean's mood. Sam is also much better at calling Dean out for his bullshit than Cas is. Sometimes it's like the two brother speak a language no one else understands and even though Cas sometimes feels left out because of it, right now he could really use a someone who is fluent in Winchester, because Dean's behavior is worrying him.
"I just don't get the point. If I want something, I buy it. If I want pie, I bake one. If I want to have friends over, I invite them. No special occasion needed."
And Cas tried. He really did his best to ban their conversation to the darkest corner of his brain, but it wouldn't stop bothering him.
Dean has told him over and over again how glad he is to have Cas in his life, how much he means to them. He doesn't often use words to express it, but despite his current incapability to interpret his boyfriend's behavior, Cas knows Dean.
Cas wants to reach out for him and wipe his tears away, but his hands feel too heavy and he can't remember how they work.
Dean meets Cas' gaze with pleading eyes and the tears he fought so hard to hold back are freely running down his cheeks now.
"Cas said 'I love you' just like you told him to, but unfortunately for the both of you, your perfect plan didn't work, 'cause I didn't get the joke.
"I didn't drink that much. They thought I'd be fine," Cas belatedly replies, and his words have the sobering effect of a bucket of ice water.
If things go on like that, he can consider himself lucky, if he manages to not spill the hot tea water all over himself.
Ready to run as soon as he was out of Castiel's sight, Dean turned around to start the humiliating walk back to his own apartment.
All this time Dean doesn't say a word and when Cas drops his gaze to check if the man is still beside him, he finds Dean watching him with a soft look on his face and a warmth in his eyes that has his face heating up.
While the woman in question looks like Christmas came early this year, it suddenly dawns on Cas that Dean probably said what he said, because he did not want to outright say that he doesn't want to go with Cas.
"To the drive-in theater," he says with a grin and the look on his face is so genuinely excited and happy it distracts Cas from his initial train of thoughts.
The few times they spoke they got along well, but it didn't happen often enough for them to become friends and they never moved past school related topics.
"It's fine, Dean," he begins and talks right over Dean's scoff of disbelief, "sometimes it's easiest to talk to people who are not that involved in our lives. I know it’s sometimes hard to remember, but you don't have to worry about failing or not being good enough, because you are. You are enough.
He internally debates whether lurking at the door or wandering aimlessly through the crowd will make him look less pathetic and is seriously entertaining the thought of returning home, when his gaze is met by piercing green eyes.
"I can't believe I've been complaining this whole time and did not think of my best friend. He's a jack of all trades when it comes to handiwork, if someone can do it, it's him."
The thought made him chuckle, which then turned into laughter until he had to lean against a lamppost for support and was gasping for air.
It is meant as a joke, but instead of sarcastic he sounds dead serious and Balthazar laughs so hard, Castiel can hear his rips aching.
Weird. It's not like he's expecting anyone (anymore) and since his apartment is on the fifth floor of a building that is mainly inhabited by childless couples or singles like himself, there aren't usually any kids going trick or treating.
It's when the year says goodbye with one final bang, colorful explosions illuminating the sky and even though he knows all about the negative effects of fireworks, Castiel can't help but be enraptured by its ephemeral beauty.
Sometimes Dean needs to be forced into talking for his own good, but sometimes -like today- it is better to wait for him to work through it on his own until he is ready to talk about it.
"There is something I wanted to talk to you about," she says earnestly and he automatically sits up a little straighter, sensing where the conversation is headed.
Everything he knows about Dean is either completely superficial or second-hand information from Charlie, yet he wants nothing more than to be close to him.
He's wearing a white t-shirt and blue jeans and the simple combination should not be as attractive as it is.
It is absolutely impossible to listen to anything but Dean’s movements behind him: rummaging through his backpack or having whispered conversations with his classmates or the way he sometimes laugh to himself or jokes around or simply exists in a space that close to Castiel.
He awkwardly waves Cas off before he can say anything. The last thing he wants is for Cas to feel like he has to apologize for the way he feels. Or rather does not feel.
He hears Dean screaming for a medic, but the sound is distant and muffled like Cas is floating under water.
Dean rubs the back of his neck and stares at his feet and Castiel needs a moment to fully understand the words he just heard.
Not only does she own her inner (and outer nerd) with every fiber of her being, she also owns every room she walks into.
Right now the customers are still coming in waves, picking up a cup of coffee for a long drive home or purchasing last minute baked goods, but Dean knows that around noon the shop will be deserted.
He rubs his palms together and his eyes dart from the ugly grey carpet to the weird abstract painting that hangs next to where Cas is standing, before looking down the hallway and it's then Cas realizes how much this has bothered Dean.
It is hard to concentrate, because the weird tension lingers and Cas can tell that Dean's mind is somewhere else.
Ash next to her is all lazy smiles, until his gaze lands on his watch, and he nearly falls off the bench.
"Because," Dean said, shutting the oven door with a lot more force than necessary, "it is just another day and I don't want you to make a big deal out of it and don't tell me you won't."
Charlie had tried to introduce them once, but Cas -despite being determined to make a good impression- had found himself tongue tied and unable to utter a word, let alone a whole sentence.
The knowing look on Rowena's face does nothing to ease his nerves, but when she places a - surprisingly cool -  hand on his arm, he still risks a glance in her direction.
He is about to take a step forward, when Charlie rushes past him and throws herself into Dean's arms.
After all, the content of the book could be entirely school related and maybe Cas is going to find notes or homework that will help him return the journal to its rightful owner.
Dean is petting Cas's hair, and Cas is lying in his lap with his hand still on Dean's cheek, even though his eyes are closed now.
They have reached the elevator and Charlie pushes the button to summon it without even catching her breath.
"I still don't get why you're forcing me to be here. It's not even the actual party, so I am even more out of place than I would have been otherwise," he complains and looks around, expecting someone to object his presence. He kinda hopes for the excuse to leave. So far he has not seen Castiel, so if he gets away now, there could still be a chance of surviving the afternoon without making a fool of himself.
"Be right back," she calls over her shoulder, clearly pleased to have come up with a solution to their problem.
Indulging in childish fantasies is a waste of time when there are two boys who clearly need a push in the right direction - towards each other.
He shrugs as if it's no big deal, but Dean knows how hard it is to loose a parent, so he grabs Cas' hand sandwiching it between his own and holds onto them.
He has really been looking forward to this night, but now that it's here he almost wishes to be at one of these terrible Halloween parties.
The man's dark hair is windswept and snowflakes are just beginning to melt in the warmth of the coffee shop.
Do you have any idea how much this hurts? I believed him, Sammy. My brain didn't even register that this was some stupid prank or an easy letdown or whatever the hell you two intended it to be and I spilled my guts to him. I told him everything and for two short minutes I was happy. So if you figured I needed a reminder that I am not fucking good enough for Cas, then congratulations. Message received."
Not talking about pop culture or anything like that ... I don't know if you remember, but I was never any good at that."
Outside he could hear a key rattling against a lock and his anxiety returned immediately with full force.
He is so loved by someone so wonderful and yet he's unable to see it, does not know that there is someone longing to be by his side.
The man hesitates, before nodding slowly, like he's not quite sure about his decision yet. His eyes dart around like he's looking for something to say and when they settle on the menu, he grabs it like a life line.
"You know what, never mind," he says and turns around to fulfill the guy's order before anything else stupid comes out of his mouth.
Maybe his feelings for Castiel were never more than platonic and now he doesn't know how to let Cas down easy, doesn't know how to tell him without ruining their friendship.
“It’s mainly because we’re both terribly single and can’t afford to pass up on the chance to get some,” Charlie chimes in.
Although he considered the possibility for an embarrassingly long amount of time, until Meg threatened to show up at his house and drag him to the party in his sleeping pants if he really decided not to come in favor of hanging out with his parents and their friends.
"Why are you staring at me? Don't you think I would've done something about this if I could? What about tech freak? Can't she rewire the stupid thing or reboot its system or whatever the fuck is necessary to get breathable air into this shit show of an office?"
The weather makes it impossible to concentrate and it doesn't help that he is bored out of his mind.
He knows Charlie is about to give him a speech about self-deprecation, so he pulls her into a hug and kisses the top of her head to shut her up in advance.
The way he says it makes it sound like Castiel had planned on participating in either dangerous or sexual activities tonight rather than dreaming of still being holed up in his room, eating unhealthy amounts of crisps and popcorn while watching reruns of his favorite movies.
The handwriting looks vaguely familiar, Cas notes absentmindedly, but he's too distracted by the gravity of his find to try and place it.
With burning cheeks, he lets the notebook slip into his bag and pretends to focus on his schoolwork.
He looks down at the living room table which is practically spilling over with food and hopes Dean's hungry. He knows Charlie can put away a ridiculous amount of sweet considering her size, but even then he probably has enough candy to last him for weeks.
Instead of answering Dean reached for Cas' hand, pulling him into a hug and pressed a kiss to his forehead. Melting against his boyfriend, Cas allowed himself to forget his purpose for a short while. He didn't want to argue with Dean, and arguing about something like his birthday seemed ridiculous, but it felt weird to not know. They had not been together for long, only recently updating their relationship status from roommates to boyfriends, but there had been an instant connection between them, and considering they shared everything, not knowing such an important detail about the man most important to him just felt wrong.
He chooses a slice of apple cinnamon pie which is sort of christmassy, but also not really and puts the entire order on a tray without spilling milk or sugar and manages not to burn himself even as he puts everything in front of the man, who is looking out the window like a statue.
"You did not go overboard, but you invited the people he loves. You stood in the kitchen for hours, preparing food and baking him three kinds of pie. You got him practical gifts that are still personal - tell you what, if he doesn't want that Marauders' map apron, I'm taking it, and I'm not above stealing his new hoodie either, even though I'm pretty sure you planned on doing that."
It's beautiful and calming and he loves the feeling of early December when the year is coming to a close yet somehow has a feeling of endless wonder to it.
A small hand on his cheek brings him back to reality. Charlie is looking at him with a worried look.
"It's not fair, Cas. Why do they get to have that and we don't? Still don't, after so many people spent so many years fighting for us to have it, gave their lives for us to have it."
He doesn't want to know how long Dean has been dealing with all this pent up anxiety on his own when he blurts it out to a practical stranger.
"But it's soo boring to be stuck at home," she whines and an expression of absolute despair appears on her face, "Kara refuses to watch Harry Potter or Stars Wars with me, so I am stuck watching terrible Christmas movies instead. I don't know with which forgotten entity I messed to deserve this fate, but they are very very pissed."
It's not the first time is peculiar behavior and mannerism has made somebody uncomfortable. It happens quite often that he accidentally irritates someone though usually not on this scale. To see the immense repercussions of his behavior is disheartening, because it shows him just how out of touch he can be with the rest of the world.
They are probably just in the kitchen, getting Castiel some water, but he doesn't want to leave him alone as long as he doesn't know for sure.
Cas quickly types his reply wishing Bess to get well soon. She and Garth are soon to become parents of twins and their little ones are already keeping them on the go.
"You are not out of place,"Charlie contradicts with another eyeroll. "And you're the one making it awkward. You have covered so many shifts for every one of us, we'd be lost without you. Besides they love you, so quit looking like a dear in headlights."
"I would've deserved it. I was picking up some stupid stupid necklace, because I wanted to keep a stupid promise and because I couldn't be smart just once. It should have been me. Why wouldn't you let it be me?"
"I want to be with you, Cas. I want the entire world to know that  I am yours and you are mine. I want it so badly and yet here I am, paralyzed by the mere thought of embracing you in public for too long."
Times passes slowly and as predicted only a few people come in, but the man remains at his table and looks out the window and watches the by-passers.
The small journal looks old with its broken spine and stained leather cover that is soft underneath Cas’ fingertips, worn from use.
A sudden brightness forced Dean to squeeze his eyes shut, but he'd recognize that low, gravely voice everywhere.
He bites his lip and shrugs, before asking: "What about you, Mr. Top of the class? What are you doing?"
"You just don't want to be alone at a work event," Dean murmurs out of the corner of his mouth, aware that their arrival hasn't gone unnoticed.
"Needless to say, I gave her my number and asked her out," Charlie continues like that’s no big deal and Cas can't help but envy her confidence. Never in a million years would he have been able to strike up a conversation with the person of his interests, let alone ask them out.
