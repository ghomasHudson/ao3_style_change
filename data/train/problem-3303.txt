“I want you to cover us up and get out of here, go find other people.  Whatever crazy other life you lived in that coma made you stronger than the rest of us, you need to go help others or at least try.”  John nodded, he didn’t know what else to say.  He hadn’t really said goodbye to his wife or his son’s.  But he would try.
“I’d really like to.  How do I know we can trust you?”  Negan’s anger flared at the guys biting tone.
“Yes Dean I ‘capiche’.”  Cas even used the finger quotes, then looked to Dean’s eyes and tilted his head.  “But would it not be simpler to put my shower things over here,” Cas indicated toward the corner or the shower where there was a little shelf, “And my toothbrush here?” Then he indicates the little toothbrush stand where both Dean and Sam’s toothbrush hang.  Dean rolls his eyes and nods.
So of course it all made sense when his real mother appeared to him and told him the truth.  That his mother was a murder, that he had come from somewhere else.  That this whole existence was a lie and he was meant to belong somewhere else.
“Crazy people who don’t really have too many reasons to worry about death.  Or those who like tipping the scales in the favor of good and away from evil sons of bitches.  Saving people, hunting things… it wasn’t so bad. The actual hunting itself.  But the life around it?  That was some steaming pile of dog shit.”  Mary sighed and rolled her eyes at the phrase.  He raised his eyebrows at her.  “It’s true!”  She just shook her head at him.  And so the rest of the night went on. Eventually they turned on a hockey game just so they’d have something to watch… and subsequently yell at.  Mary ordered them all pizza.  John felt more alive than he had in years.  His sons were fun and happy. His wife was snuggling up to him and giving him shit at every turn.  It felt like a life well lived. Too bad it hadn’t been his all along.
“I think it’s best.  Before I felt empty without the Host in my head, or knowing my connection to them was severed.  But this was a choice.  Everyday, little by little I chose this.  And becoming Hemlock, using the rest of my existence  doing this feels right.”  Dean smiles at him, deciding in that moment it doesn’t matter what he feels about it.  He’ll have his own choices to make in the coming weeks.  Things he’d thought about in the bleak moments between losing Cas and getting him back.  Instead he leans forward and pecks his lips quickly in acceptance.  Then he turns away from Cas, shucking his coat and flannel.  He reaches the shower and flips on the spray to let it warm up then turns back to Cas who is watching him closely. “No argument?”  Cas asks, and Dean shakes his head.
“There were a lot of times where Cas would come in the house when he heard John yelling.  When I was young and even when I was teenager, Cas was always pulling me out of hell.  Saving me from bullshit at school too, I’d get into fights.  But he’d hear my dad going off so he’d come in the house and tell him off.  It always shocked the hell out of John.  This tiny, dark haired, blue eyed little thing telling him to shut up and stop scaring his son’s.  Then he would come and find us and he’d take us over to his house for the night.  His dad was an alcoholic too, but the pass out and distant kind.  Barely ever saw him really.”  Dean smiled thinking of one particular night.  “Sometimes we’d go over to his house and his dad was nowhere to be seen.  Cas said he was the heaviest sleeper, so we would put Sammy to bed and then we’d play pirates, or cowboys, or astronauts, or anything we could come up with.  But usually the first two, ‘cause they were my favorite.  And Cas knew I wouldn’t be able to sleep easily till I got dad’s episode off my mind.”
“Be nice to him, he’s one of your Youth kiddos.” Then she speared another piece of potato off her plate to continue eating her dinner.  They sat across from each other in the kitchen, good ol’ meat and potatoes (Made by himself, Mary was a horrible cook) talking about their days.
“Are you okay with it?”  He asks, knowing how difficult Cas’s transition to being human had gone last time.  Cas nodded and gave a small smile.
“Yes, but there was something else.”  Dean gestured for Cas to get on with it.  “Well with my new position as Hemlock, I couldn’t just be human.  Especially since I’ll be able to go between the worlds freely.  All of them.  So Jack made me immortal.  My only condition was that I be able to live a life here with you while also doing my job.  I asked Jack to go and find that human woman and ask her if she wanted to actually take up the post.  That way there will be two of us.  And if we ever get tired of the job, we can find and train replacements as long as Jack approves.  He was very clear that it had to be a choice.  He’s even giving the Angels a choice now.  He’s making new ones, obviously.  And more than just angels, but he’s letting them explore their options on what they’d like to help run.  Those with a history of crimes against humanity have been relocated.”  Cas finishes and Dean still doesn’t know quite how to feel.
“God damnit John.  I shouldn’t be sitting on you, you’re as frail as your father after this year.”  John completely startled at that.  His eyes snapped to her face, even though the atmosphere was playful a moment ago she noticed the way he paled slightly.
“After.”  Cas told him, which made Dean swallow thickly and nod.  Together they went down the hall towards the main area of the bunker holding hands.  When they rounded the last corner into the bunker though, they came to a surprised halt, their hands dropping because suddenly both their arms were full.
It was another quiet hour with only the sound of Mary’s breathing and the occasional car driving by maybe a little too fast.  And there was shouting a few times.  When he peaked out the window he saw a few of his neighbors, one was stuffing his car frantically while the other watered his plants.
about that as well.  Damn Charlie for ever directing that at the two of them.  Sam was never gonna let him live it down.
“For our Bishops we would like one to represent a phone call to the hunter Garth Fitzgerald and the other to call the demon Crowley.”  Cas announces. Coy gives a short whistle.
“How could I forget!  He used my favorite… lotion as the raft for Jack and Rose duck.  It got so much water in it, I couldn’t use it anymore!”
“I thought they only did this stuff around the holidays.”  Jess stage whispered to Cas, which made him laugh.
“Oh?  How did you get into that?”  John asked, the more he pretended this was easy the easier it got.
“I thought that was my life.  My dad ran out when I was young, mom raised me until she’d fulfilled her duties.  I think I reminded her too much of him, so she ran off to Maine to open her B&B… While I’m going through will you tell me what’s similar and what’s different just so I can start to get a grip on what I’m supposed to know?”  Mary nodded and smiled slightly.
“Yes, Dean.  You have, but I always love hearing it again.”  She dropped the wet rag on the coffee table and produced two more guns for Cas and Jess, and two more even for John and herself. “But you should probably start running.”  Mary said and cocked her gun, John marveled wondering when the
“You like what you see?”  It was the scruffy fuck again.  “You want to try the merchandise?  Just let me know.  Trust me man, it’s a whole new world now.  Anything goes.”  The fucker sounded so proud and excited, but his words made something inside John snap.  That last piece of him that wanted or hoped for something better died.  Anger and fury flooded his system, right next to the familiar vengeance he’d lived with for most of his life.
“You got what you wanted from me.” Cas spoke in a low voice. “You stole my chance at happiness, but that doesn't matter. I saved Dean Winchester, my purpose has been fulfilled.” Cas stood up, facing it. “Nothing you can say or do will make me regret my sacrifice for him.”
The empty had chosen Dean's form again. Castiel began mentally preparing himself for the worst today.
Jack frowned. “Wait… won’t God be alerted by your pow-…” With a subtle flapping sound, Michael disappeared. “…ers.”
"I'll check what we have in the library." Sam patted Dean on the shoulder before heading up the short bit of steps, heading towards the numerous bookshelves.
speech was very cute. Especially since it wasn't so 'unrequited'. It's funny to me but... had you told him earlier you might have been able to spend some time with him."
“No clue. Heaven, if there’s anybody in it, they aren’t answering. As for hell, the spell to get in isn’t working, so either hell is gone, they closed up shop, or Chuck is screwing us over, which honestly, I wouldn’t put past him.”
They took the ride silently, only Jack speaking up once in a while to give occasional directions, based on where his soul was telling him to go.
"Cas," Dean spoke first. "... I never want you to think," Dean threaded his fingers through Cas's. "That you can't have me." Cas stared at their hands, seeming to short circuit. Dean bit his lip. "I'm yours for the taking... if you still want me."
"'Anything that belongs in the empty will be put to sleep' remember?" The empty was beginning to dissolve into black. "As long as your precious Castiel's an angel, he belongs here."
“What-… What happened.” She looked around at all of them, finally laying eyes on Jack and immediately sensing his power.
He reached with his blade, slashing at the nearest one and the one that followed right after. They croaked, dissolving into inky black smoke.
Dean sat in the bunker kitchen, cup of coffee in hand. The coffee was getting cold but Dean didn't care. He still sipped it anyways.
"Oh sorry, me and our friends have been betting on whether you and Cas would get together for years," He shouted from the hall. "Gotta go collect."
"Purgatory." Dean said. "The first time. I spent a year wandering through that place lookin for you, you'd think a guy would know what love looks like." They sat in silence for a moment.
"So..." He started. "As best man and brother of the groom, it falls on me to give a speech," he paused, everyone looking up at him expectantly.
Sam sat stunned, the sudden absence of Castiel obvious and apparent. Sam’s eyes drifted to Dean’s shoulder, gaze lingering on the new bloody handprint on his coat.
"Stop. Just Stop it." The Empty laughed at Dean. Drips of inky black starting to stream from its eyes. Staining its pale skin in Castiel's form.
"Piss off." He flipped the angel blade into his other hand and thrust it into Zachariah's chest. The angel shrieked, turning into a formless black blob, flecked with grace.
“We should go try and find Chuck.” He said over his shoulder, before leaving the room. Sam stared after him, concern for his brother written all over his face.
Dean knew what that meant, and he was running out of time. He looked behind him to see numerous angels rushing at him, Zachariah furious and in the lead.
What stopped Dean from full on rushing to embrace the angel was something in the expression. It looked cold, bitter.
Dean released a shuddering breath, reminding himself that the empty was just trying to get under his skin, which sucked because the empty was very good at it.
She looked down at her hands, and a large curved scythe appeared in her grip. It looked similar to Billie’s, but it was longer, with a wooden handle, and a more rustic appearance. A ring sat on her finger.
"Please..." He said quietly, but making no other protests, believing entirely that he deserved this.
Black sludge had spilled from the walls, wrapped around his throat, and pulled him into darkness, but the fact of the matter remained the same.
Lucifer showed up in a lot of them. Having said yes to him was really something that still bothered him immensely. Because of that one decision, he had caused many problems in the future, including Jack's death for the first time.
"Remember me?" He lifted Dean up by his coat lapels, and started dragging him away from the crowd of angels. "Don't worry guys, me and Deano are gonna have a nice long chat." The crowd of angels were starting to fade back into shadow, taking Cas with them.
Dean came up behind Sam, who was sitting at a library table, nose deep in about four different books and what looked like a stack load of old notes.
Cas reeled backwards, reminding himself over and over again that he was in the empty, not there, he was in the empty, that wasn’t happening now.
“We have no time to lose, lets go!!” Sam said. He rounded the table, grabbing his discarded coat off a chair and running full pelt toward the bunker garage, Dean and Jack right behind him.
Sam walked into the bunker library, having done nothing but sit in his room for two whole days. Not a lot else to do anyways.
In an instant the angels froze. Black sludge traveled up their legs and streamed from their eyes, but they stood motionless, fixed in a position of rage.
"I'm sorry..." Castiel whispered, his voice trembling. "I'm sorry, I'm sorry I'm so so sorry, please forgive me, I'm sorry...."
It wouldn't matter though. The black oozed around his hands and feet pulling him outwards. Nothing to protect him anymore.
As the shapes came close, they became more distinct and Dean realized with alarm  that he recognized what they were. Black eyes, dark smoky wisps trailing off them, something that was once, in the vague sense, human.
"Yes, we did happen to find a way to put the empty back to sleep. Rowena down in hell helped out of course, and Jack and Sam. And Michael too, actually it was mostly Adam convincing Michael but it worked out ok."
Cas slowly raised his head to meet Dean's eyes. Dean's heart thundered in his chest. Cas leaned across the table, and gently caressing Dean's face, he kissed him, soft yet filled with such a desperate longing, tears leaked from Dean's eyes.
There was no light, no shadow, no heat nor cold. The only sound was that of his own breathing, and a faint... noise, somewhere in the distance.
“Dean! Why the hell didn’t you answer my calls? I thought you were dead!” Sam yelled. It had been just like Eileen. Sam hadn’t known what to think and for all he knew Dean might have been gone just like the rest of them.
The angels were not expecting him, and Dean, catching them by surprise, barreled into the large group, slashing and stabbing at everyone in front of him.
Sam groaned. He lifted his head slightly before sitting up and leaning on his elbow. There were deep circles under his eyes as he looked up at Dean.
It only took a moment. Like turning up the volume of a radio, the sound of people and movement seemed to fade back in. Sam and Deann looked all around them and there they were. People. Real living existing people.
One of the demons grabbed his shoulder. He reached under his arm, stabbing it where the stomach should be. It dissipated but another arm reached out, grabbing Dean at the knee. He cried out, falling as the demon pulled his legs out from under him.
"Come on, please..." Tears rolled down his face. "Don't leave me. You can't leave me. Not again, you stupid son of a bitch."
"You're a fool you know. Sacrificing yourself that way. You'll be here with me, in pain for all eternity. What was the point?"
“So…. I’m the new Death…” She said, looking up and down her scythe. “Call me Betty.” She gazed around at all of them. “Now where’s the book? I assume that's what you made me Death for.”
“You know,” He said, slowly walking towards them. “Eternal suffering sounds good on paper but as a viewing experience it's just kind of…. Eh.” He stopped. “So, we’re done. I’m canceling your show.”
There was a loud pop as Michael burst, creating a surge of energy around them, bouncing off the air and the waves ahead of them.
The night started with a dance between Sam and Eileen, the sole people on the dance floor. The music was something of Irish sound, an idea from Eileen given her heritage. The dance was fast paced as they circled each other with step and stomp motion, Eileen twirling on Sam's arm. Sam had worried that Eileen wouldn't enjoy herself because she couldn't hear the music, but she assured him that despite that, she still enjoyed the dancing. Everyone standing at the sides clapped to the rhythm of the music and sometime after the second verse, they began to join in, linking arms and skipping across the floor, shoes stepping in time.
They hit him, kicked him, tore at his clothes and his hair, screaming they're anguish at being stuck in the empty because of him.
Sam patted him on the shoulder. “It's okay Jack, We’ll be fine. You just keep the portal open and we’ll be back with Cas as fast as we can.”
“Well, maybe that's the point.” He said quietly. Dean glanced at him but didn’t say anything, the same thought having crossed his mind.
“Where you first met that primate you fell in love with? Funny how you would choose a filthy dirt eating monkey over your own brethren.”
"I- uhhh, hold on I'll be right back." Dean ran off in the direction of his room, leaving Sam and the rest of them to stare bewildered after him.
Eileen sat on a towel, bathing in the sun. Jack, Little Bobby, Jess, and now two year old Henry splashed in the warm ocean waves, being followed and running after the happy dog, Miracle. Cas sat beside Dean, the two holding hands as Cas piled sand on top of himself.
He sat up. He was in a barn, the walls covered in painted black sigils and wardings. And with a sudden thrill of his heart he recognized it. Where they'd first met.
Cas shook his head frantically. "No, no you can't- hhh you can't be here..." He started to pull away. "You're not real. You're a trick. You're trying to trick me."
His hand shook with the effort. As his eyes glowed brighter, the cover of the book began to light up as well. There was a slight whine in the air as the grace worked to open the book.
“Don't give the Empty the hand until you find Cas. If you call to him, he should come to you.” Jack said. “And good luck.”
“Yeah I get that. But you said in his deal the empty could only be summoned when he was really happy for once, and Billie was literally about to kill you. So what the hell made him happy?”
"Nah, I love these two with my whole heart, and Eileen, you're wonderful for him." Dean took a breath. "I'm sad Mom and... Dad... and everyone that we've lost, that they couldn't be here to see this, cause I know that they would be so proud. And Sam, I am so proud of you," Dean turned facing Sam. "You are the bravest, smartest, kindest, most compassionate person I know, and I wouldn't be here without you. Had you not stood by my side, all these years, I don't think I would have lasted this long to see you get to have... this. So thanks, Sammy, for always being there for me."
Michael paused. “I never spent much time on Earth. I was curious about the reception of God and Heaven.”
But yet he still felt all the heartbreak, misery, and cruel impact that came with hearing those words again.
Christmas rolled around, and true to his word Sam had set up the Christmas tree, though it was a little more 'Charlie brown' looking then expected.
Cheers erupted from the crowd as Sam leaned in, kissing Eileen. There were smiles, laughter, bells rang. The ceremony had been set up outside on the grass where a small set of trees sat by a sparkling lake, a park picked out by Eileen herself.
"I'm gonna get you out of here ok?" Dean spoke softly to him. Castiel squinted at Dean, as though trying to figure out who it was. His eyes traveled up the pants, flannel, angel blade, but they stopped at the coat, bloody handprint still on the shoulder now darkened with time.
There was a moment of silence, Dean still staring into his coffee, feeling Cas's eyes on him. Then Cas sighed.
He had done it. He had left this world, a smile on his face, fully content in the fact that he had done it.
There were bottles littered about him, most of them empty. Dean grabbed the neck of one bottle, only a few sips left in the bottom. Sam frowned as he lifted the bottle and downed the last of it, but he didn’t move to stop him.
Dean gazed in amazement and relief as the frozen staggered angels around them melted into piles of black ooze.
“Well…” Jack thought, racking his brain for anything that would apply. “I exploded in the Empty about a week ago.”
“I mean picture it!” Chuck began to say. “The two of you, your little lap dog Jack,” Dean clenched his fist.
"And we will be here for Christmas. I expect to see a big tree, lots of decorations, Home Alone set up, ready to watch..."
Dean had barely any time to celebrate however before he watched with a horrible sinking feeling as the smoke settled on the floor, melting into the darkness and rising up with a new form.
“Jack?” Dean knocked on the bedroom door. No one came, but Dean could hear sniffling from inside the room.
"Yes I know, I'm supposed to be dead. Funny thing about that, I am, only now I'm awake. Awake in the empty."
"SHUT! UP!" The empty roared. It quickly threw a hand at Castiel's throat and all at once Castiel felt a horrible tearing. There was no blood, no sudden hole or wound, just immense pain.
He didn't know if they could hear him. If any of the angels could hear him, but after a moment of watching, Balthazar and Samandriel looked at each other, then turned fading into darkness.
Dean wistfully smiled at him, reflecting that despite his power and wisdom beyond his years, Jack was still just a little kid.
"EMPTY!" He yelled. The angels were almost upon them. "IF YOU WANT IT, I'LL GIVE IT TO YOU. BUT IF YOU DON'T STOP THEM YOU'LL NEVER SEE SLEEP AGAIN."
By the time the music started up, the sun was setting. The fairy lights hung around the tents and trees glowed, showering everything in a golden light.
"We're rescuing you, you idiot. You'd think I'd get an opportunity to grip you tight and raise you from perdition and not take it??"
The burning flared up over Castiel's entire body making him scream. The empty's smile turned into a grimace and it slapped it hands over its ears.
Amara nodded, a silent agreement passing between them to forget past mistakes and to make good on their actions in the future.
“Ok,” Jack began. “This started happening a bit ago, but at the time I didn’t tell you guys cause we were so busy with everything else but… well… anyways…” Jack grabbed a plant and placed it in front of him.
Dean rolled his eyes. He gripped the end of Sam's bed and ripped off the covers, throwing them on the floor.
“SCREW YOU! Screw. You. I really-… I really cared about something for once and you stole that. So maybe it is about Adam, I honestly have no idea. But I am siding with them because you? You ruined the world.”
Dean put his face hands and sighed. He then felt a hand on his shoulder and looked over to see Jack.
Chuck whimpered, and cowered on the ground. But Sam and Dean just walked right past him followed by Jack.
He turned around, facing the portal. He reached out a hand and with a flash of light, he was gone from the bunker.
"And it's you! It's really finally you! And you-... you were my first priority you know but we, well.... anyways."
“Jack!” Sam called and Jack turned around. “It's time to go.” Sam pointed over his shoulder at the Impala.
Dean turned. “See, that’s not who I am. That's not who we are.” He gestured towards the rest of them.
But as long as Dean was there to tell him its alright, to light the lights in the dark, to be there right beside him in the night when Castiel would wake up in a panic, he knew that everything was ok.
He didn’t notice as the small potted plant sitting by his bedside suddenly dwindled and died, turning brown in a matter of seconds.
“DEAN!” Sam’s footsteps pounded down the halls of the bunker, getting closer with each step. He ran to the dungeon, flinging the door open.
He was proved right when they looked at Dean, varying amounts of recognition and hatred in their faces. Dean noticed with a nasty feeling that Uriel stood at the front of the crowd, long dead but still an asshole.
There stood Jack, looking at Chuck, rage in his eyes. Chuck could sense it, the large, terrifying waves of power bleeding from the boy.
With the golden glow of his eyes, he held onto Michael and Amara’s hands, their eyes began glowing the same color, golden veins traveling up their arms from where Jack touched them.
Castiel had been sitting in the dark for a while now. Watching the way he had let Jack's grace get stolen by Lucifer, and how he had let Michael take Dean. It should be soon now. The empty would come, hurt him, and then throw him back into the abyss.
"Cas- Cas? Hey buddy you with me?" Cas slumped weakly against the wall. His eyes fluttered open, out of focus, dazed and in pain. Dean couldn't see anything hurt, but he guessed that whatever injuries came the empty were not exactly physical ones.
He was standing on a beach. There were hills in the distance, and the sea sparkled as wind blew through the many trees behind him. It was beautiful.
Jack nodded, signaling that he was coming. He stepped over the dead plants around him, a new sense of worry creeping up.
Dancing, laughing, at some point someone had opened up the bar so a great amount of merry drinking occurred. Jack stood in deep conversation with Amara, both reflecting on the more human sides of their rather cosmic lifestyles. Miracle slept peacefully by the buffet table, wagging his tail happily whenever people stopped to give him pets and treats.
He was lying on the floor of what he assumed was the empty. Of course it was the empty, he’d just been taken by it, where else would he be? Though he had expected to go to sleep….
A shadow crossed the empty’s face. It’s expression changed, bitter, furious, seething as it took in breaths. With each breath the wails seemed to pulse.
Michael looked to the sky. “I think it would be good of me to return to Heaven. See what’s become of the angels, and help to rebuild.” He said.
So, Dean, with angel blade in hand, and purgatory blade tucked within the inner coat pocket, he turned to the rest of the group.
"No, no, not like that." Dean lifted Cas's face to look him in the eyes. There was a twinkle in Deans expression.
They swarmed him. Angels he knew. Duma, Ishem, Hannah, Theo, Hael, the hundreds that he had massacred as a result of letting leviathans from purgatory infect him.
"I was so stupid. Death, I cut her, she would have died on her own, he could've been fine, he wouldn't have had to... he wouldn't have... he didn't need to die!! He would still be... he... he..." Dean broke, his breathing dissolving into heavy panicky sobs, and tears started to stream down his face.
And like a bucket of ice water he knew what it was. These were all the demons he's killed, coming for him with a vengeance.
“When the rapture began I took refuge here, it is Saint Michael’s, you may have noticed.” Michael shot a subtle glare at one of the angel statues, no doubt supposed to depict his own image.
Chuck stared in confused horror. The pages were blank, nothing written. Chuck reached out, grabbing the pages and turning them over, flipping through them in a desperate attempt to find something, anything.
Jack stood in the doorway, his eyes red and streaked with tears. He stared at Dean, before running at him and wrapping his arms around his middle.
"You don't know, do you? He didn't tell you. He didn't tell you how he wasn't allowed to rest. How Naomi had given him the order to kill you and how he had fought with everything to avoid that. How he had tried to take the angel blade in his hand intending to plunge it into his own heart to save you."
And as he began to scream again, it cut off. He choked as he felt through his entire body like he had broken his own voice, like a knife had been dragged through his vocal chords, ripping and shredding them to pieces while he just lay there, gasping and wheezing in an absence of voice.
Jack stared at them, not really thinking of anything. All of a sudden the plants crackled, turning brown and dead, withering into nothing.
Everything was black except a soft golden glow off to Dean's right. He looked and there was the portal, quietly crackling, awaiting his return.
[Ok first of all, accompanying the recap, Carry on My Wayward Son plays cause the Cw are a bunch of pussies and I can't believe they didn't do that, come on guys it's like tradition]
"Yeah it's me." He said, his voice shaking. Dean held out open arms, waiting for Cas to come closer, but not entirely sure what Cas would do. "Sorry it took us so long."
They didn't hunt as much anymore. Only helping with things that other hunters couldn't handle, doing quick research if people needed it, and they were the ones to call if certain sheriffs needed confirmation from their 'FBI superiors'.
There were tears in Sam's eyes, and he was smiling, trying to hold it together. He stood up, wrapping his arms around Dean who hugged him back, crying a little with him.
Chuck smiled at his own joke. Dean’s lip twitched. Everything about this dude was really starting to tick him off. But he buried his feelings, knowing exactly what they had to do.
But Dean rose with new vigor. Again he aimed to punch Chuck, but Chuck caught his arm. Dean screamed as the bone broke. Chuck sent a kick into Sam’s side. He lifted Sam by his coat, and pulling his arm back, he heard the shoulder crack. Dean cried out as Chuck stomped on his leg, the bone shattering. Blood streamed down their faces, and they coughed.
“Amazingly, the believers loved him. They have for thousands of years.” Michael chuckled slightly. “I guess my efforts were more effective than I’d hoped.”
Castiel took it, nodding and smiling. Dean led him onto the floor, taking Cas's hand in his, wrapping his other hand around Cas's waist. For once, Cas wasn't wearing his trench coat, just the plain black suit. A rose was tucked in his front pocket, one Dean had put there himself.
“He is dating someone, but it’s a more… recent development.”  Mary cleared her throat slightly and looked away.  “I’m sure Dean will tell you about that though.  In time.  Oh!  I should call them, I’m the worst mother ever.”  John chuckled at her frantic moment, finding even her familiar forgetfulness endearing.
“It was worth it.”  Dean says, staring hard into Cas’s eyes.  Trying to say all the things he couldn’t possibly have fit in those words.  Willing him to know everything he wanted to tell him before he could even get the words out.  Cas lets out a puff of air.
Mary didn’t wake up till the next day in the hospital, it had been more than 24 hours and John’s nerves were frayed.  The boys had been for visiting hours and he’d sent them both home, all of them were a mess without Mary as a buffer.  When she came to she was groggy, not coherent really except for one thing.
“Yes Dean, I-”  And then Dean Winchester interrupted Castiel, angel of the lord, for the third time that night.  And there wasn’t anymore talking for quite sometime.
“Do you think you’ll be able to love someone else after I’m gone?”  Mary asked in a voice quieter than the crackling of the fire but barely louder than the rustling of falling leaves.  It hurt like a stab wound.
“He means, we’re gonna go get you all the necessities.”  Sam clarified, coming up beside him and pulling on his coat.  “Can’t wear the same suit and tie everyday anymore.” Sam smiled at him comfortingly and the ex-angel returned the sentiment.  They opened the doors to the impala just as Dean was revving the engine.
“Only 5 or so times with your words, but a million times with those eyes.  You have the perfect smize just for me.” Erata crows proudly as she stands up and gives him the most sultry look.  He winks at her and she comes dashing across the space between them to straddle his lap. She presses her lips to his with a fervour he eagerly responds to.  His hands come up to grip her waist, feeling up and down her body before squeezing her even closer. She grips the back of his neck and runs her finger tips up through his short dark hair, scratching lightly.  They both pull away to breathe and rest their foreheads together.
with you.  You’re it for me, sweetheart.”  Dean told him, shaking a bit at the confession and watching as tears spilled over Cas’ eyes, surrounding the blue in water that broke Dean’s heart a bit just remembering exactly how much he loved Cas.
“Just some ambitious dumbasses trying for a better life.”  Victor answered, which made Dean breathe a little easier.  Their causal yelled conversation was almost comedic, too bad it couldn’t last.  Twenty or so people managed to make the work easier after they’d all jumped the blockade, but the bozos just kept coming.  Dean’s group kept working to clear a path for Garth, they needed a good path so the truck was still operable, and Garth was almost done blocking off the right side.  As the blocks were placed, more people took up space behind them with spears to poke at the bozos gathering on the other side.
“You’re not just saying that for me, are you?  Cause I would be okay if I knew you found someone… if you could love again.”  John just shook his head and tilted her chin up slightly so he could meet her eyes.
“I just-”  But Cas takes a step and interrupts him, taking the fishing metaphor out of his hands and replacing it with shallow clear water, spear in hand.
“Well, to be frank.  Not much.  I remember an entirely different life basically.  Some things were similar, some things were very very different.”  John answered, dancing around anything that might be too heavy.
”  Charlie asked with a squeak at the end, sitting up to stare at Dean in disbelief, Dean just nodded.
“Yes and No.”  Jack answered and started to pace away from them slightly. “Let me explain.”  As he continued he walked back toward them and gestured around like a teacher.  “I did a lot of research about this, about the world.  About everything and how it used to be run.  I want it to be able to run like it should.  Without me having to intervene, but also I want it to be inclusive.  So I’ve met and talked with what’s left of the old God’s.  And I’ll be going to the Empty to potentially redeem a few of the others.”  Jack paused and smiled at Dean.  “Kali was a big help in convincing them all.  She apparently still appreciates you saving her life during the first apocalypse.  Anyway, humans are varied.  For the most part they’re good.  But they believe in so many different and beautiful things.  I want them to have those things.”  Dean stares at Jack confused but Cas seems to understand, he’s smiling at Jack.
“Yes, Raphael.  I am at Heaven’s command.”  Castiel added in, his unwavering fealty a reassurance.  Raphael sighed heavily.
“No, why would I?”  He drawled out. Charlie sighed, then a mischievous glint passed in her eye.  Dean sat up a little straighter and wagged a finger at her. “Don’t give him any ideas.”  Charlie just rolled her eyes.
.  John thought to himself, fighting off the crippling sense of utter despair.  A voice deep in his mind whispered cruely
Suddenly someone with blonde hair pulled back into a ponytail jumped down into the fray from the blockade into the amusement park, she hacked and sliced with skill, and Dean watched amazed as more people hopped from the other side of the barrier.
No matter how fully settled he was into this new safe, monster free, peaceful life of his, his reflexes never quite relaxed.  He was a light sleeper, tensed at any suspicious noise, and on the worse days he felt a sense of heavy dread.  The other shoe had to drop eventually, this life couldn’t be that perfect.  It would be three years in a month.  Those were the bad days and Mary was always there to pull him out of the funks.  Promising him he was safe and he didn’t have to hunt monsters anymore.  Over the years he’d told her most of it, sparing her only the absolute worst, she’d truly been his partner through it all.  Even the occasional nightmares that happened.  Once upon a time they had been about ‘Nam.  Now they were always filled with the blood and gore of a hunt gone wrong.  Mary told him it was PTSD, and with time it would get better.  Most days he believed her.
“We’re in the living room boys!”  Mary called and got off her husband’s lap, easily shoving his legs to the floor to make room then went to meet her sons.  “Don’t worry, he’s as spritely as ever.  Don’t bother going easy on him, that’ll just piss him off.”  John chuckled at that.
known.  You’d even give Sam and Cas a run for their money.”  Dean told her honestly and heard Charlie giggle just a bit.
So of course, it wasn’t even that much of a surprise when Charlie knocked on his bedroom door and shortly after shutting it asked:
“We’d been swimming in that creek for years at that point.  And yeah, maybe it was stupid to go out there by ourselves when we were so young, but it felt important at the time.”  Dean paused and ran a hand down his face, Garth was watching him with his usual kind eyes that Dean couldn’t look at.  They were too sympathetic in the best and worst ways.  “Anyway, I told him I’d go in the water.  That I’d pull him up after he plunged in.  I wouldn’t let him get sucked under, or drown, or float away.  He said he’d do it cause he wanted to be brave for me… but he was the bravest person I’ve ever known.  So he did it.  I went in the water, he got on the swing and swung into the water.  He over shot a bit, crashed right into me, but it was so worth it.  All of it.  We snuck back in that night as the sky was just starting to get light again.”
“Do you know what to do?”  John asked his son-in-law, who nodded weakly.  Cas’ gaze went to Dean’s face.  The hand holding the knife delicately used a knuckle to trace the contours of his face.  Cas didn’t say anything, just pressed a kiss to his Dean’s temple and lined up the knife at the back of his skull at a slanted angle.  Cas put his cheek against Dean’s hair and pressed the knife up so swiftly John didn’t even blink before it was done.  In the space of a few hours his whole life had folded in on him again, but this time it was worse.  John felt the tears on his cheeks slow, Cas was still holding Dean even as his body slowly slumped away from him.  “Let me put him upstairs with his mother.”  John said and stepped forward, Cas nodded but couldn’t let go.  John carefully unpeeled the boys fingers and scooped his son up in his arms.  Cas couldn’t look anymore, he buried his face in the couch as John took Dean up the stairs and lay him next to his mother.  This was something he hadn’t done in what felt like eons, he wanted to pretend, to remember those moments instead.  The times where his song fell asleep downstairs and he had to carry him to bed.  The times where he crawled into bed with his mother and father.  Not this, anything but this.
“Yeah, no…” Chuck grinned at the brothers. “I appreciate the white flag and all but, too little too late. I’m kinda enjoying this story now.”
“MICHAEL, WHAT THE HELL SHE WASN’T FINISHED!” Dean roared. But Michael looked as confused and alarmed as they were.
But Dean didn’t respond, he barely even registered that Sam was there. His breathing hiccuped and his face was red and swollen, like he’d been crying for a long time.
"Huh..." Sam thought about that, nodding slowly. "....You know, if it's a girl we might name it Lillian, after the the hunter that took in Eileen,"
Then he was gone. Sam and Dean looked around in utter shock, the horror dawning on them that they were truly and forever, alone.
“Is-… Is Adam back?” Dean asked. Michael nodded, and with another surge of light in the eyes, the expression and posture changed, clearly Adam’s.
Dean turned. "Well it's your wedding day and all and I thought waking you up to a song dedicated to your one true love might be the ticker to getting you out of bed." He gave Sam a smile before heading down the hall, followed closely by Miracle.
"Oh don't be do dramatic," a sharp point nudged into Castiel's side, the anticipation of further pain making him gasp. "You're boyfriend is fine. Though, considering, that God's plan involved giving you to me, I don't think whatever he has in mind for Dean will be as... pleasant."
Shock surged through Dean, the distinct memory of stabbing this guy up through the head came forward in the mind.
It had become a sort of pattern. The empty would come, take out it's tired anger on enjoying watching Castiel suffer, then it would throw him into the black, where he would spend the rest of his time reliving his greatest regrets over and over again.
Mostly Sam took care of the technical stuff, research and all that. Dean had looked into construction work, taking up a job for himself. And by the time august came up, nearly 11 years after Sam's wedding, he started looking at houses to either build or purchase. Places where he and Cas could just... settle.
"I prefer the word oblivious..." Cas mused. “Less dumb…. less ass.” They both laughed, leaning on each other's foreheads.
They slowly walked down the aisles, carefully looking all around, but it didn’t seem like anyone was there.
It was the empty, wasn't it? But the eyes were wrong, the smile was wrong and why did it feel so.... real this time? Had it finally perfected it? Was this another trick?
"Yeah it's my purgatory blade." Dean said looking down at it. "I was just thinking... if we're gonna make a magical, crazy powerful object might as well make it a cool one. Oh and I also brought this."
Castiel swallowed, a dry sob escaping his raw throat. His whole chest hurt, not just from whatever the empty was serving but from the knowledge. About how it might have been easier if he hadn't been so oblivious. If he'd just taken the time to say something sooner. And now Dean was alone, and blaming himself, and Chuck would destroy them.
"Be careful with this." She handed it to Dean. "We have to use it as a bargaining chip, and it must not be prematurely used."
Now everything was drenched in darkness, and despite being secure in the knowledge that he had experienced true happiness just by saying it, Castiel couldn’t help but feel like he was drowning.
"Frankly, it's a wonder Sam has lasted this long without her." Sam rolled his eyes and there was a rumble of chuckles from the crowd.
Cas breathed. Then he broke. He rushed into Deans arms, pulling him closer, like he couldn't quite fully believe he was there. Like he would disappear at a moment notice. But he was here and he was real.
"Hey, we did it." Dean whispered onto Cas's shoulder. "We beat Chuck. He's gone, he's finally gone."
He looked around and saw nothing but the suffocating darkness. The darkness was odd however, for despite the pitch back of it all, it never gave Dean the feeling he couldn't see. It was just... absent of anything.
“Alright. We should get out stuff together.” Dean turned to Michael, motioning his head towards the portal. “Head out.”
Dean twirled the empty whiskey bottle in his hands. “Any idea if there’s anybody in heaven or hell?”
Fire scorched his veins again and Castiel jerked and screeched, gasping and raspy. An impossibly large smile ripped through the empty's stolen face.
“Guys?” Jack saw Sam and Dean. Sam was standing near one of the walls, while Dean sat at the table, open laptop in front of him, and looking like he’d been hit with a truck.
“Alright kid, you think you can pull this off?” Dean asked. Jack looked at him and slowly nodded. He took a deep breath and lifted his hand.
He screamed, the energy flowing through him, creating bright, white, burn marks of power tearing through his face, his soul, his vessel.
Thunder crashed as the Impala rolled up slowly to a large church. The stone walls towered high above them and the large stained glass windows made it give off an eerie glowing light.
"What?" A wide, crooked smile curled up the empty's features. "Don't like hearing the horrors he experienced because of you?"
He hit them, again and again and again. Blood stained their clothes and their faces, matting in their hair.
"A surprise? Oh come on, how could I not pass up an opportunity to," Dean cleared his throat and in his best Cas impression, "'Grip you tight and raise you from Perdition."
Dean held Cas, mind racing, faced with a choice. He could lose Cas now, never see him again, or lose Cas later, once he's realized what's been done.
Sam shook his head, standing up, and putting the blankets back on his bed. Then he went to the closet, opening it and gazing at the black tailored suit, which stood at the front of all his clothes.
They were demons. It was an instinctive thought, but Dean felt as though he knew them. Something inside them was so familiar and so very wrong at the same time.
Coming up the road behind him, Michael heard the subtle rumble of the Impala engine. The car doors opened and he could hear the crunch of gravel underfoot.
“I…. He… hh.” The words were stuck in Dean’s throat. He kept opening his mouth, then closing it again, faltering, flailing for the right thing to say, terrified of admitting it was real.
“Hey guys!” Both Sam and Dean tensed, and turned to see him, Chuck, standing there with a large, overly confident grin plastered on his face. “Enjoying a little ‘Alone time’?”
“So… take care of the bunker while we’re gone okay?” He turned to go, and made it halfway down the hall when he heard the creak of Jack’s door open.
Coming up on an abandoned gas station, they decided to stop, the Impala needing gas, and Dean himself needing to use a toilet.
Castiel had touched his shoulder, for the last time he thought, and had tossed him out of the way, staring face forward as the empty oozed from the walls and enveloped him.
“I feel like you’re about to make some sort of spider analogy.”  Cas tilts his head side to side in consideration.
One of the many nights since he’d come here, one where he’d snuggled with Mary into the early hours of the morning after a late movie night, a foolish thought had crossed his mind.  That some benevolent deity in their wisdom had seen to grant him mercy, to give him what he’d never had.  Now he knew the truth though.  Nothing ever hurt so bad as knowing how good things could be and having that all taken away.
“Okay.” Cas releases a breath of relief over the stressed lines of Dean’s face and they smooth out in response.  Cas let’s his hands leave the wall and they come up to gather Dean in his arms.  He tucks Dean’s head under his chin and just holds him, stroking hands up and down his back.  As the minutes pass the tension leaves Dean, with each pass of Cas’ hand the muscles and knots unwork themselves until Dean’s hands let go of the jacket and his fingers splay over his button down, one thumb lightly tracing at the clear, circular plastic.
“You didn’t think I could feel like what, Dean?”  Cas asks.  But seriously fuck him, because he could have made this easier and he is choosing not to.  Dean narrows his eyes, feeling the challenge rise up inside him.
“Yeah, not my best moment.”  Dean admitted, very aware of how Cas’ body was pressed up against his in the bed they were now sharing.
“Stay the fuck back or you’re next!”  He shouted at them and gave a final swing to the skull of the misogynistic, abusive piece of shit.  His eyeball popped out and rolled slightly away from the mess that once could have been called a head.  “I know that was a little startling.”  Negan addressed the group without facing them, their utter silence was enough to know they were listening.  “Truth is I probably got a little carried away.  But it couldn’t be helped.”  He turned to them slightly, looking over his shoulder, the fire still crackled away casting ominous shadows on him.  “You scared?  Scared of me?  Scared of
“Very well, what else?” Coy asks as they both think for a few moments.  Dean tugs at Cas and pulls him away from the chess board so they can turn their backs and talk without being stared at directly.
“I’d say frustrated.”  Cas said, dropping their hands, standing up, and coming to sit on the edge of Dean’s bed so they were even closer.  “Never in my wildest dreams did I imagine you yelling that at me.”  Cas sighed and bumped shoulders with Dean, smiling shyly.
“Yes please!”  Charlie asked, and Dean got the impression she would have hugged the woman if she wasn’t so busy.
He wondered to himself and his mind drifted to his two boys he’d never see again.  Sam and Dean, the ones he’d raised as hunters, would never give up on their world.  John knew they were still fighting, so he had to try too.  Saving People, hunting things.
On the last week of October, in the middle of making a pot of coffee at 7am his phone rang loudly in the empty kitchen.  Mary hadn’t woken up for a few days and the nurse was due in half an hour.  He couldn’t fathom who would be calling him this early.  The caller I.D. showed Bobby Singer, so he pressed the answer button.
“It got easier with time.  Do they know what’s wrong with me?”  John frowned and gave her a grim nod.
In his moment of distraction a bozo came up on his left flank, Dean only had the warning of Charlie’s eyes widening slightly, he turned just in time to see someone from the other camp with short and curly blonde hair pounce on the thing and take it down.  Dean took out the one coming behind her then turned to help her up.
“Typically they don’t.  Most of the time they just walk or fly right into it by accident.”  Dean hums at that and also leans in to look at the chess pieces. They’re very detailed, the king and queen look like actual old-timey kings and queens.  Ren Fest style. With real Bishops, Castles, and Knight topped horses. “Fancy.” Dean comments and moves to flick at one of the pieces.
“You guys are the worst.”  Then he shut the door on them and went to his own room, a small smile shaping his lips.  Not bothering to wonder when or
“I’ll stick with Sam thanks.”  Jess laughed and checked her foam bullet supply, barely stepping out of the way as Dean and Sam ran for their lives with their mother hot on their heels.  “But if this is the secret to looking as good as Mary when I’m her age, I’ll take it.”  That made both John and Cas laugh as they all walked out more calmly together.  Which turned out to be a bad decision as the other three had teamed up to ambush them as soon as they stepped out the sliding glass door into the backyard.
“Then there was the yelling.  Sometimes, I don’t know if he even realized quite how loud it was.  Other times I knew he did.  Some days he would just rant and rave about us, about the town, about his jobs.  He had them occasionally.  Sometimes, he would be so bad.  It was scary, especially when we were young.  I used to take Sammy and we’d hide in a closet.  I’d lock us in and give Sammy some headphones so he could fall asleep.  Then I’d wait, the whole night sometimes, for him to pass out so I could carry Sam to bed.  One time he just sat outside the closet waiting, but didn’t see us.  I don’t know what he was seeing.”  Dean shook his head.  “As we got older it was more clear that it was just pathetic.  He was crippled by his addiction, and he could barely see us through the haze.  Sam despised him for it.  He only ever knew the person dad was with a bottle in his hand, never saw him for who he actually was.  By the time he actually wanted to get sober, it was too late.”  Dean let that hang in the air.  He could feel Charlie breathing next to him, felt her tiny palm wrapped around his, he didn’t deserve her and yet he had her.
“Dean, we’re gonna get you in the house.  You still okay?”  Cas asked, hands checking for other injuries besides the meat missing from his neck.  Dean nodded weakly.
“I’d say we ‘snuck’ out but seeing as we were both over 18… Anyway it was night, and we were having a sleepover up there just like we always used to.  We had some real lanterns up there that we put candles in instead of kerosene, and we had padded chunks of the floor so it was real cozy.  Only needed blankets or sleeping bags.  Normally I was roaming the country while he was at college, but in the summer we would both come home and spend time together.  This time though, I’d left him a note.  Told him to come find me there later that night.  I was up there all day, worrying my way through multiple attempts..”  Dean’s hand went to his wrist where he played with the faded rainbow friendship bracelet there.  Charlie saw the movement and realization dawned on her.
“We were in the fort we had built.  Cas refused to call it a tree-house since we had built it for tactical advantages.”
“Anyway, your mom sounds like she reacted exactly how I expected her too after all the stories you’ve told me about her.  She really loved you.”  Charlie says kindly and nudges Dean with her elbow.  “What about your dad?”  Dean sighed, knowing this was Charlie cashing in a chip to something Dean avoided as part of their friend therapy relying on mutual vulnerability.  John Winchester was a ghost Dean liked imagining only in his past.
“Cassie I said no!  They’re dead.  That’s that.”  Dean pulled away from her, shutting down to fight off the ache that felt more like a stab at her unnecessary insistence.  He grabbed some maps and left the room, unable to even feel her false hope pressing on his firm certainty.
“What’s up with the ducks?”  Dean glanced up, from his book, confused for a mere second before understanding passed over him.  Then he shrugged.
“I don’t wanna leave you, John.  I know I should want to stay to see Lucy grow up, or to see Dean and Cas have kids, but I wanna be selfish.  I don’t want to leave you.”  John sighed, his breathing hitched.
Dean says, still obviously confused but the slight relief at seeing his best friend is obvious in the set of his shoulders.
“Humans!  See, this is why I never wanted to keep your lot.  You just have these heaps and heaps of… audacity.  What makes you think you can invalidate my deal?  I could use another good laugh before going back to sleep.”  The Empty leaned forward slightly, as if waiting for the punchline to some great joke.  How could Dean, this simple human, have some unknown power over the Empty?  But Dean had come prepared, not with weapons, or spells, or sneaky plans, but with facts of ancient rituals.  Things that might not have held much gusto between two humans, but because Cas
“A soul claim.” Dean says with a slight smirk, holding a strong stance.  The Empty sits up a little straighter in its goo throne, face becoming more passive but Dean thinks he sees fury in its eyes.
“I may have implied that he needed to loosen up a little.”  Dean responds as they climb the stairs and walk to their respective sides of the Impala.
“Love you, boy.  Thank you.”  John hung up after that, not sure if he could talk anymore without blubbing.  Mary’s face was still so peaceful and beautiful, he wished she were awake to offer him comfort and calm him down like she always did.
“Boy be quiet, don’t interrupt your mother.”  John told him and his son’s lips pressed into a thin line, Mary reached over for his hand and he easily offered it to her, giving her a squeeze.
“Yeah, I don’t need to see that.  Got it.”  She took a deep breath in preparation.  “You know the Mall of America?”
“You and Sam knock differently.”  Dean purses his lips at that as if thinking it over momentarily, then he shakes it off, clearly remembering why he came in.
The ins and outs and go betweens that it took him to get here weren’t what mattered.  The state of the rest of the world, hell, the rest of the
“No, no.  I don’t want that.”  Dean winced and John felt more tears come to his eyes, he wasn’t even sure how he still had any left.  Dean turned to Cas.  “Give us a moment, Dad.”  John nodded and the door upstairs shook a little harder than before.  He pulled the knife from his boot and left it on the table.
“Heya!  Sounded like trouble, need a hand?”  Asked the blonde in a thick Minnesotan accent, Dean almost laughed from how silly it sounded in the middle of the fray.  Charlie did laugh.
“I have an idea.”  She told him, bouncing from foot to foot, her nose barely wrinkled once she got close to him.  “Bobby and Ellen think it’s a good idea, but they wanted me to ask you what you think.”  Charlie told him as she followed behind Dean who wasn’t stopping on his mission to rinse the day off of him.
“Our bracelets…” Cas said, a curious look on his face.  Dean glanced down and smirked a bit.  In some unknowable way, the two friendship bracelets had caught on eachother and fallen off without either of them noticing.
“Why ask me?”  Dean asked.  He wasn’t the leader of their group.They didn’t operate in a dictatorship fashion by any means, it was more Bobby and Ellen called the shots, and anyone could voice their opinion, but if you still disagreed with the final move then you could find a highway to start walking down.
Cas words echoed to him across the months and straight into the gaping hole in his chest where he belonged.  His ‘no commiserating’ rule was a complete sham.  He told stories about Sam and Cas to anyone who would listen, he had these sessions with Charlie, and Cassie… Garth even.  Maybe he wasn’t always sharing the sad bits, but he was still spreading out the weight of pain that even the happy memories caused.
“Yeah, but it took me like 10 tries to get it just right.  Even when I had something passable it was never as neat as Cas’ were.”  Dean shook his head remembering how many times his dumb fingers kept getting in the way, how many times he’d pinched them when tying a knot.  “So Cas, of course, didn’t ask why I’d summoned him to our old hang out.  I mean, we were 20 at that point.  We didn’t go up there super often anymore.  But like I said, he didn’t press it.  We just hung out and talked and argued and what not till it was well past midnight.  The lanterns were burning low, both of us were getting sleepy when  he finally asked if there was a reason why I’d left him a note instead of just texting him, or even just telling him.  I nearly clammed up, but I was determined if I was gonna tell someone it
Face up, stance ready, kill these fucking bozos.  He can feel the strain of his arms, all the repeated motions of stabbing, slicing, yanking, kicking, are starting to take a toll on his muscles.  The adrenaline is starting to ebb the longer this goes, his limbs going shaky.  He isn’t surprised when his next swing goes wide and cuts into the bozos shoulder, just disappointed.  Especially when the thing’s shoulder gushes, the skin and muscle slides in a gross wet sound as the thing frees itself and topples Dean to the ground.  He cries out as his leg hits bad and he knows at the least he’s just sprained it.  He’s got his hands pressed into the things chest as its teeth in a lipless mouth snap in his face.  Disgusting smells and textures all around him, the bozo’s entire weight pressing him down and not allowing him to get leverage.  He has no idea where his blade is but he can hear Charlie calling out to him, he turns his face to the side still holding back the disgusting thing as he tries to spot his weapon.
“Will you be okay for a moment?”  Mary asked with her hand on the door.  John nodded and smiled, a gesture which she returned.  “God, I missed you.”
“Dean, where are Sam and Charlie?”  Cas turns to him alarmed, grabbing his arm and cutting off the rant mid procession.  Dean looks utterly baffled for a moment, several moments making Cas worry. Coy coughs slightly and Dean is hit with a sudden realization.
“They had a talk with me earlier, and it wasn’t pleasant.  I want you all to know that no matter what I’m going to fight this-”
“She’s very much present.  However you will be dealing directly with me for the rest of this game.  Watching gives her inspiration and I live to inspire her.” He clears his throat glancing around the room.  Dean puffs up in frustration.
Meanwhile, Cas quickly walks from war room through the library and down the hall to his bedroom precariously gripping a large clear bag filled with yellow plastic.  The shipping label reads,
