, round and a shiny gold with a large silver gear in the middle. He must have put the plug in while they were at home and John bit his lips to stop himself from burying his face in his bum at the thought of Sherlock making the trip to the studio with it shoved into him. Instead, he lifted his hands to seize his cheeks in his palms, pushing them together to watch the gem shift deeper into him. He heard Sherlock gasp and fumble with John’s holster and huffed out a small laugh of satisfaction.
“You take the women tonight and I’ll handle the men, as long as Michael will tear himself away from you. He looked particularly keen on you yesterday.”
Any lingering tension seeped out of Sherlock and his face broke out into an enormous smile. John couldn’t help but kiss it, falling forward until he was draped across Sherlock’s prone body. When they finally broke apart to gasp in breaths, John shifted them both around so that they were side by side, their bodies touching from feet to chests. Sherlock ran a finger along John’s bare clavicles, his expression thoughtful.
Hoping to further avoid meeting Sherlock before he was ready, John went down to Speedy’s as soon as he was clean for an early breakfast. He could only delay himself there for so long, however, and once his coffee was gone and his food nothing but crumbs, he headed to Regents for a walk. With any luck, the time alone and fresh air would help him figure out what to do next.
Grinning back, John fell back into silence for the rest of the ride. Niall sent them right up to their dressing room when they arrived, his face agitated and distracted. John didn’t let his sudden worry over his old friend distract him from the more pressing matter of the evening ahead, but tucked it away to ask Niall about later. When they entered the dressing room, it was to find a wide array of clothing and accessories beyond just the items from before that John brought along with them. John approached one of the racks of clothes and ran his hand along them thoughtfully.
John finished stacking the logs in the fireplace of their flat later that night and cast a quick spell, settling it into a softly crackling blaze.  When he stood and turned, he found Sherlock padding out of the kitchen in his pyjamas, two glasses of wine in his hands.  He passed one over to John before folding himself up on one end of the sofa.  Before John could even settle himself on the other end, Sherlock had drained half of his glass in one swallow.  Raising an eyebrow, John sat sideways on the sofa to watch Sherlock finish his wine and set the glass aside, staring blankly ahead as he did.
“Keeper.  When I first tried out in my second year, they tried to get me to be a seeker because of my size, but I was bored out of my skull.  Sure, when you spot the snitch it’s thrilling as hell, but most of the game you spend sitting around watching.  When I was a keeper, I could keep track of all the action still but actually got involved too.  Keeper’s basically a goalie in football but more exciting since it’s in the air and with three hoops instead of one goal.”
She shrugged and shuffled her feet, refusing to meet his eyes.  “Just around.  Sometimes he comes to the hospital when Da’s busy and keeps me company.  He took me to the library once so I could get a book.”
“I’m a wizard,” Sherlock stated without preamble.  Violet lifted a hand to her mouth, her eyes widening.  “We’ve discovered that I have enough magical ability, despite the quill’s question mark, to allow me to get my own wand.  I’ve only just started to work with it, but – “
Sherlock hummed and leaned back into John’s touch.  “At least that meant she wasn’t surprised when you told her.  I did say you had nothing to worry about.”
“Not exactly what I had in mind, but sure,” John said with a chuckle.  As she began to meticulously roll the bandage back up, John grabbed a second one along with his wand, sanitizing it with a quick spell before tucking it away in an individual plastic package Cecelia held out for him.  They worked in relative silence, broken occasionally by Cecelia humming to herself, and soon had a box of freshly cleaned and packaged bandages.  As John set the last one back in the box, he crossed his arms over his chest and studied her.
Shaking his head, Niall replied, “Every time I think you two can’t surprise me more, you prove me wrong. So we’re going with gears tonight?”
“Shh, love, you will, of course darling.”  His hand shifted from Sherlock’s scalp to the back of his neck, bringing his head down to rub their cheeks together reassuringly.  “God, I remember living without you and it was awful; I plan on making sure that never happens again.”  He waited until Sherlock had calmed down again before guiding him back to make eye contact once more.  “Let’s clean up and get dressed, yeah?  I can write Poppy a response and we’ll figure out a way to tell everyone while we make a stop down to Diagon Alley to send it.”
Instantly the table filled with platters of food, at least double the amount than either Sherlock or Cecelia had seen during previous meals.  Both of them gasped in shock, simply staring at the now filled tables at first.  John’s quiet laughter seemed to break them out of their stupors.  He pulled a platter of pasta towards him and scooped a spoonful onto Cecelia’s plate.  She stared between it and him, her forehead wrinkled in an uncertain frown she must have learned from Sherlock.
Shrugging, Sherlock set his mobile back down and laced his fingers together on his lap. “Not much, but I have done it before. I’ve always been the one tied up, so I would prefer to do the same this time.”
Mycroft shook his head.  “I am afraid not.  I merely exemplify the Muggle half of Muggle/wizard relations.  Though our bloodline does have a spotting of magical background, I’ve been told.”
“It’s not that,” he said, clutching the phone in a tighter grip.  “Just something from Sherlock.  He sent me a text last night at bloody two in the morning.  Shouldn’t be surprised, but it got me thoughtful.  We can still go.  I want to.”
Rosmerta arrived seconds later, two pints of butterbeer in her hands.  “On the house, gentlemen,” she said, grinning widely at Sherlock.  “Just let me know if you need anything else.”
A month passed and still Harry and his Aurors hadn’t discovered Doyle’s whereabouts.  John seemed fairly certain that he was long gone, escaped to the mainland or perhaps farther.  Though he was grateful that John was no longer worrying about the matter, Sherlock still expected that Doyle wasn’t far and would show himself soon.  Without inside knowledge or direct interaction, however, there was little he could do.
like I did with John's in FI.  These woods were all possible options I wrote down when selecting a wood, but as soon as I read sycamore's description, I KNEW it had to be Sherlock's.
“Hey, don’t think like that.  You’ve got it in you and you’ll make it work.  We’ll work on it together, just like we do everything.”  When Sherlock raised an eyebrow at him, he shrugged a shoulder in acknowledgement.  “Most everything.  Everything from now on, at the very least.”
Sherlock consented to a piece of toast and a cup of tea, John refreshing his own to join him.  They made idle conversation over the table as Sherlock ate and John fiddled with his phone, swiping it on to check the screen every few minutes.  Finally, the last crumb of bread was eaten and the final drop of tea was swallowed and Sherlock pulled John to his feet.  John’s eyebrows rose in question as Sherlock shoved him out into the sitting room.  Sherlock’s reply came in an eye roll as he twirled himself into his coat, gesturing with a raised chin for John to do the same.  John chuckled and did as instructed, following Sherlock down the stairs and onto the street.  Before he could raise a hand to hail a cab, one pulled up to a halt before Sherlock.
With a huff, Sherlock replied, “Irrelevant.  Send your friend back off on his merry way; he’s of no use to us.  He can hardly see a foot before his eyes, you can tell from the state of his trousers.”  He spun about to begin studying the bodies once more, vaguely hearing John apologize to the barkeep.  By the time John’s attention had properly returned to Sherlock, Tom was back in his inn and Sherlock was spouting out a string of deductions.  “This first one lived in the neighbourhood, single bedroom flat, modest for his otherwise impressive occupation of business owner. The woman and the other man were an item, friends of the first, all together for a small celebration between the three of them over the couple’s recent engagement.  None of their personal items were removed from the bodies, unless our murderer has a doubtful inclination towards OCD tendencies and ensured the bodies were returned to their former state of dress before they were disposed of.  If you ask Lestrade, you’ll discover this isn’t the case, as his imbecile people pawed at the bodies in search of their wallets, which are in custody.  Though the term etched into their foreheads is one I’m not familiar with, it was certainly meant to insult, a warning to others of similar dispositions to beware.”
“You’ve told me before that the owls for Harry Potter refused to give up until their owner received them.”  Sherlock shook his head, his eyes clenched shut.  “Shouldn’t the same have happened for me?”
Sherlock glared at the floor, his arms tight at his sides visibly shaking.  “Leave, Mycroft.  Before we both do something we regret.”  His head snapped up to narrow his eyes at him.  “More than the hell you’ve already created.”  Nodding a final time, Mycroft descended the stairs.  The click of the front door closing resounded like a gunshot in the flat.
“That’s closer!  It’s certainly something.  You’ve got the magic, Mrs. Holmes, that’s obvious, it’s simply finding a combination that has the right temperament for your
“Here, pass her back,” Sherlock managed to say once they both had calmed down some.  John creaked to his feet to snatch up the cloth from the back of the chair and draped it over Sherlock’s shoulder.  He watched Sherlock pat Cecelia’s back, the motion familiar, and affection swelled in his chest for both of them.  He moved around to lean against the back of the chair and settled his arm across the top so he could play with Sherlock’s hair once more.
“That’s not part of the deal,” Kit muttered down at his nails, making his boredom with the entire situation clear. Michael laughed again, with a hint of sheepishness, and shifted just enough to block Kit from John’s view.
John let out a choked gasp as Sherlock sucked lightly at the junction of neck and shoulder, applying just enough pressure for John to feel like his skin was on fire from sensation but not enough to leave a mark. Sherlock moved his lips up higher, coaxing John into letting his head fall back. Once he had done so, Sherlock moved to his Adam’s apple, running his tongue around the edges before latching his lips around it. John’s hands snapped up to grasp desperately at Sherlock’s elbows as he gasped for breath, his knees already turning wobbly.
When they met Niall in the meeting room, he was pacing across part of the open floor, one hand rubbing at the back of his neck. He seemed to be muttering to himself and didn’t even notice Sherlock and John until John managed to tap his shoulder. He jumped and spun around, shooting them a sheepish smile.
Grinning broadly, Sherlock pulled John down by the arm so that they were lying on the floor side by side on the plush circular rug that was the same shade as the grass trim.  He situated Cecelia on her stomach between them, giving her enough room to crawl around and investigate without getting into mischief.  “I researched, John!  Obviously there isn’t enough room here to copy the whole of the Great Hall’s ceiling, but I was investigating in
“Mum, can I go over to Rose and Hugo’s today?  Hugo says they’ve got some bowtruckles living in the trees in their backyard and Aunt Hermione is going to teach us about them!  I won’t be out late, I swear!”
John grabbed the food and used his free hand to shake Stephen’s.  Violet circled the table and hugged them both at the same time, barely stifling a sniffle.
“Da, I’m so EXCITED!” she squealed as she nearly dragged him back into the hospital wing.  “When are you gonna ask him?  Do you think he’ll say yes?”  She pulled him to a stop and gaped dramatically, fluttering her free hand against her chest in an almost identical copy of an excited Mrs. Hudson.  “Does this mean I’ll get to be a flower girl AGAIN?!”
“Didn’t that one bloke out in the woods say something about a Holmes getting involved in the case?  Maybe it’s something you need to bring up with Mycroft.  He’s only, what, a few years older than me, yeah?  And you said he went off to boarding school as a kid…”
Unsurprisingly, Michael was one of the first to approach John. “I knew from the start you’d be one of us, John,” he said, shooting him an exaggerated wink and openly leering at Sherlock. “A posh thing like that, he needs a bit of disciplining to get him in line, eh?”
“Da’s got a new job and we’re going to Hogwarts,” Cecelia interrupted matter-of-factly.  She didn’t even look up from the pages in front of her as she spoke.  Everyone glanced from her back to John, who shrugged.
John led them down a side street to their left, pointing at a moderate sized house a few doors down.  “I think that’s them – check the number, we’re looking for 183.”  They confirmed their search with the neatly printed mailbox, three shining gold numbers spelling out the correct location from two houses away.  It took them a bit to hobble down the pavement, but Sherlock was surprisingly patient with John as he set himself a rhythm of movement and kept himself to it.  Sherlock pushed the blue gate at the front of the house open for John at the same moment a fiery haired woman burst from the home to run out and meet them.
John receives a letter one morning from Hogwarts, offering him an opportunity he didn't expect.  Together, he and Sherlock come to terms with what this will mean for their lives and begin the task of revealing their magical abilities to those closest to them.
John shifted slightly in his seat, pulling his leg up to rest across his knee while he considered.  “You didn’t really have to
John heard a deep chuckle and shuffling before someone pulled the door open the rest of the way.  He hadn’t had many expectations about the teacher Olivia bragged about on a daily basis, but the tall, attractive man who greeted him certainly didn’t fall into any of them.  There was a splotch of green paint streaked across one of his cheekbones and the occasionally glimpse of sparkling glitter shimmered in his otherwise dark curls.  For a moment, John could do little more than gape up at him.  The man cricked an eyebrow up at him, the faintest hint of a smile at the corner of his lips.
Sherlock shot him a tiny smile and took a moment to study John as well.  The design of his robes may have been the same, but because of his shape, they emphasized him differently.  His broad shoulders and chest were brought to attention by the black material encasing them.  Its length seemed to make him taller, elongating his legs and straightening his back.  He also wore black trousers, but a bright flash of yellow at his waist revealed his jumper below it.
“Not to worry, John, you don’t have to concern yourself with my blushing virginity,” Sherlock cut in, rolling his eyes. “Contrary to Mycroft’s belief, I do have some experience, small though it may be. Just because I don’t have as strong of an interest now doesn’t mean I didn’t in the past.”
Sherlock sighed and nodded.  “Perhaps.  I can always just avoid him; it shouldn’t be too hard in a place this size.”  He glanced out the window, studying the dark night setting in over the forest.  “Shall we get ready for bed?”
“It’s got the Hufflepuff crest on it, see?” John said, rubbing his thumb along one of the tiny shapes.  “They decorated the room after my house.”
When he felt Sherlock gasping for breath, John pulled away and started to kiss down his chin and along his jaw.  Licking against the skin right where jaw met neck, he let out a breath and nibbled at the goose bumps that formed in its wake.  Sherlock shuddered and a high pitched whine rumbled up his throat.  John felt the movement through his lips and groaned in reply.  He nudged his nose against Sherlock’s Adam’s apple, causing him to dip his head back and reveal more of his neck for better access.  John ran his teeth on the bump while the hand not supporting his head moved downward.  He let his fingers skim over each dip in Sherlock’s spine, eventually allowing his hand to settle on the top part of the swell of Sherlock’s arse.
John and Sherlock found themselves alone at the table for the first time since they arrived.  John moved their hands to the top of the table, twisting Sherlock’s hand around so that he could trace the veins with a finger.  Sherlock watched him in silence for a moment before finally deciding to pose the question he’d been wondering about for weeks.
“All right?” John asked once the final audience member headed upstairs. Sherlock frowned down at him.
John ghosted a trio of kisses over Sherlock’s lips, barely letting their skin brush against each other, before ducking under his arm and snatching up Sherlock’s bag.  He tossed it on the bed and started to rummage through it, soon uncovering a familiar brown bag.  Chuckling, he turned back to face Sherlock and dangled the bag in front of him.
He had no idea when he fell asleep, but when he blinked his eyes open the Muggle alarm clock on Harry’s desk was flashing half eight in the morning.  John stretched his neck to each side, attempting to work out the kinks caused by sleeping in an armchair all evening, and gave his shoulder a few careful rolls.  Despite his time out in the misty night and sleeping in the chair, it was surprisingly limber.  He felt around the back of the chair and pulled out a small, plainly patterned fabric bag.  It was a rich blue in colour and shifted easily in John’s fingers, small objects shifting around inside it that reminded him of rice.  He hefted the bag in his hand and felt the warmth of it settle pleasantly over his palm.
who is the cause of all of this.”  He changed direction and took a step toward John, nearly bringing Cecelia fully back on solid ground and positioning her almost in front of Sherlock.  “If not for you and your interference, we would have managed to continue our plan to further the cause of the Dark Lord and destroy as many dirty blooded wizards as we could.  We had it so sorted…with the three of us, we could spread out in more directions, choosing them at random and mixing them with random Muggles to keep the Aurors on their toes.  They knew the other two, but me…my name wasn’t even in their files, they had no idea I was one of them…it was so
Sherlock fingered his wand and frowned.  “No, it’s not your fault, Mummy.  How could you have known?  But why on Earth didn’t I get that letter?  There has to be an explanation for all of this.”  Suddenly he remembered Mycroft’s texts and his head shot up.  “Mycroft.  Did you ever get anything about Mycroft?”
Harry led the way to the entrance with Mycroft close behind, John and Sherlock in the rear.  As soon as they pushed the doors open, they were met by a man in Auror robes who instantly stiffened at the sight of Harry.  Harry waved off the man’s formality and introduced them all.  “Edwards, I want you to tell Sherlock and John exactly what you told me when I Flooed over here a few minutes ago.”
“I’m getting to that.  Even if I am drugged, this is all rather much to take in.”  Sherlock returned his attention to John’s wand, which he had placed on the couch between them.  It was a fairly common looking wood, smooth until the last few inches where a crisscrossing design had been etched into it, and was as well taken care of as John’s gun.  Sherlock shifted just enough so that he could look directly over at John through his fringe, their eyes instantly meeting and holding.  “What’s it made of?”
“Make sure you turn off your phone,” Sherlock mumbled in a low voice that caused John to jerk in surprise at the sudden noise.  He frowned and raised an eyebrow.
“Guess that answers that,” John said with a sigh. From his limited knowledge, the handwriting looked similar to the handwritten note from the day before. “You said he – what makes you think that?”
Feeling lighter than he had when he left the flat, he sent Sherlock back a confirmation and turned to go back to the flat.
John's niece is named Jane because I like the headcanon of Harry's Clara being Clara Oswald from Doctor Who and there's the one ep where she basically said she had a fling with Jane Austen.  Naturally Clara would name her and Harry's child after her first lady love.  Fun fact, all that info about the real Saint Nicolas is true.  I've done presentations on him because his birthday and celebration day are on my birthday, so Nick and I are bros.  Also librarian!Sherlock is the ideal opportunity to get my "I fucking love people in glasses" fix in so you're welcome.
Sherlock took a deep breath and narrowed his eyes at the spoon.  Waving his arm, he declared, “Scourgify,” pointing his wand at it.  The spoon shot up into the air and let out a sputtering noise before dropping back to the counter.  Rather than simply cleaning off the remaining dough, his spell scoured the top layer off the wood, leaving it looking raw and new with its lightened and overly smooth wood.  Sherlock grimaced and tucked his wand back into its sheath while Molly went to inspect it closer.
“What?!”  John took the offering and began scanning the page.  At the top was a single paragraph, describing what they already knew about the question mark the quill occasionally added to potential students’ names.  Below it, however, was a short list of names.  John scanned them quickly until he found what was important – Violet Bele (Holmes), 1946, was listed with the others H’s in the group.  “Holy shit.”
“You’re probably right about that.” John picked up the pile of papers on their remaining suspects. “So who’s got who tonight?”
,” John let out with a huff of breath as he attempted to catch him and lower him to the ground.  “Can’t even bloody faint without a damn speech about it first.”  He gave Sherlock a quick once over to make sure it was only shock that had knocked him out.  Other than a few cuts from being shoved about in the dark by John and a light gash on his arm where the spell grazed him, he appeared to be fine.  Nodding his satisfaction, John let him be for the moment and returned his attention to the pair of stunned men.  Upon further inspection, it appeared that he had hit the leader and the younger man, letting the final male who never spoke escape.  Given the number of years it had been since he used his wand, let alone duel, it could have been worse.  He pulled out his phone and dialed Harry’s number, shooting some ropes from the tip of his wand to bind his suspects at their wrists as it rang.  Luckily he’d added Harry’s number to his cell permanently, and he answered barely after the third ring.
“I’m well aware of your skills, as is Harry, but he knows you have a life outside of our world now, one with friends and a family.  He simply doesn’t wish for you to become a victim to these individuals a second time if he can help it.”
Sherlock had approached the barrier around the car as John spoke, his head darting between looking at it and attempting to see further into the exhibit.  As John came to stand at his side, he whipped around to grasp his face in his massive hands, placing a fierce kiss on his lips.  When he finally pulled away, John was staring up at him, a slightly glazed expression on his face.  Sherlock’s head fell forward to rest their foreheads together, his smile wide enough that John felt it against his mouth.  He responded with a series of small kisses of his own before forcing himself to pull away and guide Sherlock into the exhibit.
“Take me, then,” John countered.  “Let Sherlock take Cecelia and you can do whatever you want with me.  I’ll leave my wand with them and go without a fight if you just let them leave safely first.”
They had roughly six minutes until their train was due out of King’s Cross, heading for Peterborough for a final stop.  John’s was a few before that, in Hitchin and only about an hour out of London.  From there, he needed to grab a bus and take it another hour to finally reach Bedford and Harry.  Before Harry’s call a few weeks before, John’s plan for the holidays didn’t extend beyond a lot of takeaway and telly alone in his flat.  She insisted he come down to see her flat and meet her new girlfriend, however, and without any reasonable excuses, John was forced to agree.  At least with Christmas being a Sunday this year, he could plead only a long weekend visit on the condition of needing to get back to London and the clinic by the Tuesday shift he insisted he take.
The Three Broomsticks looked fairly empty from where John Apparated outside of it.  He glanced through the window as he headed toward the entrance and spotted Sherlock speaking with McGonagall as Cecelia held his hand.  She watched the room with enormous, interested eyes and John could tell she wanted to explore the pub further.
“Your concerns, while understandable given your history, have proven to be irrelevant.  Though you may think your trip here took longer than it ought, I very often find myself trying just as many wands with the first years who come to me fresh from receiving their Hogwarts letters.  The ability or strength of the individual magic has nothing to do with the process of discovering one’s wand, Mr. Holmes – if the magic exists, the wand can tap into it.  Oftentimes it’s more a problem of the confidence of the caster that stands in their way.  Once they realize they are capable and worthy, the wand finds them as it should.”
The room turned silent when they made their way downstairs, everyone stopping their conversations to turn and stare. Most of their attention was on Sherlock in particular, and John could tell he was blushing from the heat radiating off him. He squeezed his hand and Sherlock lifted his head enough to meet John’s eyes. He echoed the grin John shot at him and readily followed as John guided him back into the centre of the room.
Sherlock gave him his chance to shout, staying back to simply observe for once. While John quietly huffed out breaths like the silently raging bull he was, Mary continued to sit along the edge and stare out into nothing.
John shifted in his seat to hide the sniff he made to fight down his tears, clearing his throat as he moved to sit directly beside Sherlock.  Their linked hands sat in the small space between them beside John’s wand.  “To cut an already long story short, a few years after that there was a battle.  Harry destroyed Voldemort completely and we retook the Ministry of Magic to rebuild it.  After the job was done, I decided to join the Muggle army in order to get the proper training to become a doctor.”
“John Watson,” she greeted, the suggestion of a smile twitching at the corner of her mouth.  “You’re looking well.”
Reading John’s demands on his face silently, Sherlock reached down for the hem of his camisole. Slower than John thought possible, he dragged it up his body, the fabric just caressing his skin as it lifted up and over his head. Without his consent, John felt his hands following the fabric’s path up to Sherlock’s nipples. Gripping his pecs gently, John rubbed rough circles around both of his nipples, causing Sherlock’s head to fall back on a gasp.
“Jesus,” John muttered, throwing down the rose as though it burned and letting it lay flattened on the stone floor.  His shoulders slumped downward slightly in defeat.  “So she did in the others who were behind their deaths.  Now where would she go?  Does she even have anyplace left?”
I pass out.”  Having barely gotten his long winded warning out, he fell completely limp into John’s arms.
“You adorable sod, of course we’re moving back.”  His expression turned briefly uncertain.  “As long as you’ll have us, of course.”
John sighed and rose to his feet.  “Right, yeah, okay.  Anyway, I’ve been offered a temp job at my old wizarding school and I’m going to take it.  We’ll make arrangements for Mycroft to make sure the rent’s taken care of while we’re gone.  I’m due there in a little less than a month, but we’re planning on having a small do before we leave as a farewell and to explain to the others.  Sherlock and I both thought you ought to be told first.”
“Might I interest you in a cup of tea, Professor?” he asked, a mockery of courtesy turning his deep voice almost friendly.  The woman smiled stiffly back, hands folding together on her lap.
“Not at all, John dear,” she replied, not even attempting to hide her smile.  “The others are out in the garden setting up the table if you’re looking for them.  Get the lot in the sitting room out there, things are almost ready in here!”
“I wouldn’t expect that to be what you really want to know.”  Mycroft turned and the brothers’ eyes finally met.  “What did you learn?”
“Makes sense.” John finished his last sip of tea and considered his next words, fiddling with the handle of his mug. “I…hope you were okay tonight? That everything was…fine?”
Sherlock looked up from his work, his face scrunching up in thought. “I…a bit different. From usual. That’s why I came out here. Usually I want to be alone, but I felt…itchy. I still do, if I’m being perfectly honest.”
Sherlock nearly flew down the stairs, he was so fast, darting out into the street before John could even close the upstairs door behind him.  He nearly missed the cab Sherlock already summoned and could only let out a huff of agitation and subtle excitement as they took off.  “So what is it, then?  Found yourself another case?”
“We wanna learn!” Cecelia declared, spinning around from the row of ingredients she had been inspecting to beam up at him.
As Doyle inched closer, Sherlock pressed back against the shelves.  “You are aware that when someone calls John and I partners, it means romantically, don’t you?  Surely you aren’t dense enough to think otherwise.”  Sherlock felt Doyle’s hand settle on his hip once more and snatched at it, squeezing the fingers in an iron grip.  “Since you’re obviously as much of an idiot as the rest of the population, let me explain it to you in simpler terms: John is my boyfriend and I am more than happy to be in that position.  We’ve been together for over six years now and I have no intentions to leave him, particularly for someone as oblivious and moronic as you.”
The vague path they had been following narrowed ahead of them, continuing in a solid upward trajectory as they clearly made their way up along one of the many small mountains that surrounded Hogwarts.  One section tapered outward, a small, natural lookout that hung out over the edge above the forest before continuing on closer against the tree line they had been following.  Standing at the outcropping, the toes of one of his shoes dangling over the edge and Cecelia clutching at his side from where she half hung in midair, Doyle shot them a cocky wink and grin.
John abruptly broke off all physical contact with Sherlock, moving slightly away without warning. Sherlock swayed from the unexpected movement, his eyes blinking open to stare at John with a dazed expression. Grinning, John watched Sherlock steady himself, his hands falling to rest on the tops of his thighs as he waited for John’s next move. Just as he seemed to rediscover his equilibrium, John reached out and grabbed the opposing sides of the diamond at his waist and yanked him forward in a single harsh tug, tightening all of the other lines of rope in the process. Sherlock yelped from the sharp jabs of pain as he crashed into John’s front, the noise melting into a mewl as John attacked the opposite side of his neck from before.
"I never had you anyway, John Watson," Mary said with a sad shake of her head. "I was never yours and you were never mine, despite how hard we tried. You found your second half long before I ever came around." When she pointedly stared at Sherlock, John reached out his free hand to grasp on to Sherlock's hand. The motion caused Sherlock to jolt, eyes shooting between John's fierce face and their clasped hands. When he gave it a tentative squeeze, John replied with one back with double the force. Though they could see the tears in her eyes, Mary smiled slightly at the motion.
“No, I suspect I’m the only one,” Sherlock said as he pulled away and took John’s hand.  “Something about the personal aspects of what is said makes me think the students are safe from his irritable wrath.”  As they walked into the flat proper, he considered John’s question carefully.  “I think I’d rather keep the matter to ourselves for the time being.  It sounds ridiculous, but I’m slightly ashamed of the fact that some young idiot is bothering me so much.”
To John’s surprise, it took Sherlock nearly a week to realise the helmet was missing.  John sat in his chair, back to the hallway, when he heard Sherlock shuffling around.  The noises gradually grew louder and more discordant as he dug deeper into the cupboard.  When they abruptly stopped, John could feel Sherlock staring across the kitchen at him.
Sherlock returned to his subtly submissive position right behind John, his head lowering slightly but his eyes gazing up through his lashes at anyone who approached him. John couldn’t help the swelling of pride he felt at Sherlock’s proper behaviour, his approval clear in the broad grin that sat on his face. Several members of the group openly gaped in surprise at their positions, obviously expecting Sherlock to be the dom to John’s sub. It wasn’t the first time John had encountered that expectation, usually by a new partner who underestimated him because of his size. Most either didn’t know or forgot that he was a captain and primed for leading, particularly for those like Sherlock who promised to be obstinate simply for the sake of it.
“Not at all, which is what makes it feel so peculiar.”  Sherlock’s head zipped around to stare over at John so fast that a curl at the base of his scull just brushed along John’s finger.  “I’ve been drugged countless times, by countless means and substances, but beyond your claims, this is the least impressive feeling of being drugged I’ve ever experienced, if I am in fact drugged.  It’s a rather dull sensation, if truth be told.”
“I meant as more than friends, John,” Sherlock said with a sigh. When he tried to pull his hand away, John held on tighter.
“I leave you alone for two minutes and you’re trying to start trouble,” John sighed, but a smile crossed his face as he said it.  “What sort of example are you setting for
“Did my letters have any influence on it?” Mycroft asked.  A hint of childhood uncertainly lay under his question, although he attempted to remain unaffected.  McGonagall snapped the book closed and tucked it under her arm.
“I suppose so.”  Sherlock wasn’t sure why he didn’t want to tell John about what happened with Doyle.  Part of it may have been pride; he had dealt with far worse on his own before he had John and was more than capable of fighting off yet another heart eyed admirer.  He also knew he didn’t want to worry John and expected that it would only get worse if he said anything.  Instead, he burrowed his face deeper into John’s chest and sighed.  “How was Cecelia today?  She doesn’t bother you when I leave her in the hospital with you, does she?”
“John, I need you to listen to me carefully,” Teddy whispered, his eyes currently blue and blown huge.  “That woman…I don’t know who she is, but if she hasn’t told you already…John, she’s like me.  She’s a metamorphmagus.”
Snatching up a tissue from the box in front of the mirror, Sherlock wrapped it around the handle and yanked it out of the wood. After folding it closed and covering it entirely with the tissue, Sherlock snatched up the letter and read it over. “Not particularly threatening, given the means of delivery,” he said before passing the note to John. He leaned down over the table to stare at the mark left by the knife and John buried his face into the paper to avoid staring at his arse.
If not for the spilled drinks in the doorway, Sherlock might have thought the sight of John staring at him open mouthed and red faced was only a part of the fantasy he created in his head. His eyes darted from the door to his camera, the blinking red RECORD light reassuring him that it was all too real. He caught his breath and let out a shaky sigh, gingerly climbing off his dildo. He went through his usual process of cleaning up in numb silence, stopping his camera and wiping down the toy before storing it all in the locked box under his bed. As he wrapped a dressing gown around his still nude body, he glanced at the mess on the floor. His mouth twisted in disappointment as he grabbed a towel to clean it up.
“Very nice, Jane.  What else?  There’s got to be some other things Mum hasn’t let have before now that you’d like.”
John grinned against his skin and moved to nip lightly at his Adam’s apple.  At the breathless gasp he received in response, his grin widened.  “Nope, think that covered it.  But we technically haven’t had the chance to really make
They stood in awkward silence for a moment, Sherlock peering around the room and John trying not to watch him too closely. With a huff, John physically tried to shake off his nervousness, making his way around the room and grabbing a few pillows and blankets and tossing them onto the mattress. Once he was satisfied, he moved back to Sherlock’s side and scrounged around in the box, choosing two different bottles of lubes he’d used himself and enjoyed before considering the assortment of condoms.
The instant he stood outside of the shop, John knew it would be a nightmare.  Normally if he stopped outside the windows, he could see at least halfway this particular Tesco’s without any problem.  Today, however, the customers looked like they were nearly on top of each other with how crowded it was.    John groaned and squared his shoulders, giving himself a mental pep talk before joining the fray.
“Yes, but only for a year.  Not even that, really, more like ten months, just for the length of a school year.  It’s at a school, you see…the one I went to when I was young, actually.”
“She was with us every minute, Sherlock, I swear!” he cried, wringing his hands hard enough to be painful.  “We were on our way to the library…Albus and I have a Charms paper coming up and we thought she might like to see the books we needed for it…one second she was there and she was just gone the next!  We looked everywhere, Albus is nearly hysterical, no one’s seen her, we don’t know what happened!  Please, I’m sorry, I know you said not to bother you, but we can’t find her!”  As he continued to speak, his pitch grew higher and more desperate, tears forming at the corners of his eyes.
“You didn’t know because I didn’t want you to,” Sherlock said.  He squeezed John’s hand, which he still held through their argument.  “I’m sorry as well.  I should have known that you wouldn’t think less of me for asking for help, but I truly did think I could take care of it on my own.”
There was a decent sized Tesco’s about a block down from the clinic, so John figured it was as good a place to start as any.  Sarah didn’t mention whether she wanted anything in particular and the last time John purposefully bought anything holiday-themed was when Harry asked him to bring along a bottle of red to make mulled wine at the single Christmas party of hers he willingly attended.  His own flat, better now that he could afford something more than the bedsit where he originally lived on his return to London, remained indifferent to the holiday, John not finding it worthwhile to decorate if he was going to be the only one to see any of it.  He mostly focused on finding anything still available at such a late date, rather than concerning himself over the quality or the contents.
Footsteps sounded and Mrs. Hudson’s door swung open, John’s shape forming in the entrance.  “Sherlock?  You two back already?”
McGonagall’s face turned sympathetic as she nodded.  “I thought as much.  If nothing else, I hope this has given you the closure you desired.”  At John’s smile of appreciation, she turned to Sherlock.  “Professor Dumbledore’s portrait and I have been investigating what you discovered about the quill.  Apparently the Holmes family occasionally comes up on our list of possible future students, though the inclusion is intermittent and the exact reason why remains a mystery.  There seemed to be a bit of question in regard to you specifically, Mr. Holmes.  Obviously you hold a certain amount of magical ability, but the quill wasn’t entirely certain whether it was enough for you to succeed at Hogwarts.  Given what I know of you personally, I believe that, if you so wish, you’ll almost certainly be able to gain a wand of your own and learn the magical arts, though I’m afraid it would most likely be far more difficult to learn than it would be normally.”
John could only grin and flush slightly in reply before Sherlock seemed to realize what he was doing.  He snatched his hand away as though John’s skin sent a bolt of shock through his palm, his own cheeks turning a dusty pink as he avoided John’s eyes by staring down at the page.  Cecelia reached down between them to pat at the parchment, breaking the suddenly awkward silence.
Meanwhile, John stood from his chair and pulled off his gloves, tossing them on the side table next to the bed.  The sixth year Ravenclaw who sat on the bed flexed his hand, studying the bandages wrapped around his fingers.
Adjusting the visitor’s badge on his collar, John squinted at the plaques next to the classroom doors as he passed them.  The main office told him that Olivia’s classroom was number 221, located out with a few other classrooms in the b section.  He remembered hearing her mention a few times that their windows looked out to the playground, so he set out in that direction to begin his search.
“What do the runes mean?” he eventually asked, but John felt smug at the breathless quality to his voice.  He suspected the question was half genuine and half a way to divert John away from his mission to distract him, so for the moment he played along.  The hand at Sherlock’s nape moved to take the wand and he brought it closer to inspect it.
“Sounds like that’s our cue to head out,” he said with a smirk.  John shrugged and grinned, leading them down and out into the evening.  Just as he was locking the door, he faintly heard Sherlock crying out and bolted up to them.
Sherlock’s bed sat directly under their window against the wall, John’s along the wall to the right. At the moment, Sherlock knelt on his bed, the soft afternoon light of early winter peering in through their semi-transparent curtains. Rather than slouching over his desk studying or sprawled out on his bed with his laptop as John expected, however, Sherlock was completely nude, the sunlight making his pale skin glow. His knees were spread wide and John spotted a thick black dildo between them that disappeared in time with Sherlock’s thrusts down onto it. His head was thrown back as one of his hands ran down his neck, his long fingers dancing along his own skin. Most surprising was the tripod set up on the floor with an expensive looking camera pointed directly at him, recording everything Sherlock did.
Sherlock pouted briefly but followed John’s command, heading in the direction he led.  Harry and Mycroft popped up behind them and immediately began to follow.  The pathway to Hogwarts was dark, not used to having travelers to or from the school so late at night, but the glow of Harry and John’s wands lit it well enough for their small group.  They remained silent the entire way, Sherlock attempting to stare through the gloom of their surroundings and John hardly awake enough to move.  Soon the castle’s dully outlined form loomed over them as they approached the pair of giant front doors.
“Try the next one,” Sherlock called, noticing a flash of robe in greenhouse two.  Cecelia skipped down the row and pulled the door open before Sherlock could reach her.  He hurried his pace and just managed to follow her inside as she rushed up to Neville at the front of the room.
John leaned down to steal another kiss, unable to help himself.  “You gorgeous dick,” he said as he pulled away, leaning over the side of the bed with a groan to search for his wand.  Sherlock’s legs fell from his waist to allow him to move, but as soon as he straightened again he tucked his thighs up close to John’s.  One of his knees bent to give him a sprawled position that was accentuated by his outstretched arms and completely disheveled hair.  He cricked his head to the side in a purposefully seductive move and John grinned and shook his head.  “Don’t you look at me in that besotted way, you and your beautiful arse wore me out.  Not to mention you made me do most of the work like the lazy creature you are.  You’re a wizard too, you know; I don’t have to be the only one to clean us up.”
“What’s that? It’s not your dirty clothes from yesterday – you conveniently left them on the bathroom floor for me to collect.”
The sun was setting outside by the time Sherlock did anything more than flip a page.  John stood in the kitchen at the time, Cecelia in her high chair while he started dinner.  He heard a gasp from the sitting room and turned at the noise, eyebrows raised.  “Sherlock?”
Sighing, he shoved his hands into his pockets and wandered over to glance into the Great Hall.  Finding it as empty as he expected, he pondered a trip down to the kitchens.  While the house elves could be exceptionally energetic when visited by anyone, he knew he’d at least be able to finally find something to eat.  His shoulders slumping in resignation, he marched down towards the kitchens’ corridor and the satisfaction he would find there.
“You’re both Muggleborns, then?”  Sherlock lifted his head to stare across at Doyle, who watched him over the rim of his glass.  His voice was light and airy, a soft Irish accent instantly reminding Sherlock of a dead man’s gleeful giggle and making him shiver.  John obviously noticed it as well, his grip on Sherlock’s thigh tightening in response.
John’s eyes clenched shut as he shook his head.  “Fucking hell, you have to be kidding me.  You can’t actually be saying Mary is a metamorphmagus, that’s she a fucking…a fucking
“Hello Minerva.”  He grinned up at her.  “We were wondering if now would be a good time to stop over and discuss that thing I’ve been owling you about?”
John usually tried to avoid Charing Cross Road, having no immediate reason to travel down there with its inevitable excess of unwanted memories.  In fact, the last time he’d been on the street, and this pub in particular, was over twenty years ago, back when he still needed to visit Diagon Alley for the proper school supplies.  Sherlock ignored it as he marched down the alley to the pub’s left, his more astute than normal eyes darting across the Leady Cauldron’s magically protected exterior without a second glance.  John attempted to remain unphased, but he couldn’t help the chill at the coincidence as he followed close behind.
Finding a car to rent at half five on a Sunday proved to be more difficult than expected, but they managed it.  Once they made it out onto the M4, they finally started to make progress towards actually reaching the Holmes residence.  Sherlock’s fingers were white from clutching the steering wheel so tightly.  John moved a hand to his thigh, rubbing his thumb on the outside of his leg in soothing circles.
Doyle just laughed harder as Sherlock tossed him aside and strode out of the pub.  His eyes glittered as he looked over his shoulder to watch Sherlock retreat.  Rather than follow, he let Sherlock run away as he straightened and adjusted his robes.  Sherlock made the mistake of glancing into the window as he rushed past and his eyes locked with Doyle.  Doyle’s smile grew once again when he spotted the fear at the back of Sherlock’s defiant gaze.  Pleased with himself, he wiped invisible dust from his front and returned to the bar.
He had the deep burgundy one on today, the one whose material appeared both silky smooth and soft as down, that fit a touch tighter than any of the others, framing his shape even when the belt lay loose to trail across the floor.  The colour was what really caught John’s attention, light enough that when the sun caught it just right it gave off dazzling golden undertones but dark enough to make Sherlock’s already pale skin have an even stronger ethereal glow than normal.  The dressing gown alone was usually enough to settle John’s brain into focused, aroused static.  But then –
John savoured the few minutes of privacy he had before they’d be forced to go join the audience. He supposed he should have expected Sherlock to wear revealing and arousing clothes due to the context of the case, but nothing could have prepared him for actually seeing it. He hoped Sherlock hadn’t noticed his half hard cock when he first spotted Sherlock’s outfit, but with how form fitting his trousers were, he doubted it. At least he wouldn’t have any problems during their performance later.
“It’s ridiculous, like I said.  It’s new for both of us, as I’m well aware, but it feels as though there’s more at stake here.  Ruining this is not an option.”
“Alright back there?” the driver asked, his voice shockingly perky given the screaming they both had endured in such small quarters.  Cecelia whimpered and John reached out a hand so she could grasp at his finger, holding it in a vice grip more akin to Sherlock’s than a baby’s.  He curled his thumb around her wrist while taking up his mobile once more.
“John?” He looked behind him, expecting to see Sherlock and growing even more surprised when he didn’t see him there. “Where’s Sherlock?”
“Now hold on,” John said sharply, glancing between Sherlock and Jones glaring at one another.  “What the hell are you on about?  That was fucking
“Everyone always assumes you’re some great rugby champion when really you were off at your magical school playing Quidditch.”  Sherlock grinned and turned the page of the album.  “There’s always something.”
out there!”  Greg started scrounging around in the pile of clothes at the bottom of his closet, whipping off his pants and throwing them across the room.  John snickered at him and tossed a pillow at his head, missing him by an inch to slam into the wall.
“I was captain my last two years and we won four cups while I was on the team,” John replied with a wide grin.  “I suppose you could say I was pretty decent.”
She next turned to John, who was already halfway to his feet.  “Our nurse, Madam Pomfrey, has decided to take a year’s break in order to rest.  Taking over for her will be Master Watson.”  As John waved at the room, a louder and more enthusiastic cheer went up amongst the students as many of the extended Weasley and Potter family members recognized him.  He flushed somewhat in embarrassment and quickly returned to his seat.  “Master Watson was both a Hogwarts student, Healer, and a member of the Order of the Phoenix.  His partner Mr. Holmes and their daughter Cecelia will be joining us here as well.”  A low rustle of conversation followed her final statement, but was quickly quieted by others.  “I hope that you will all be sure to make them feel welcome during their time with us.  In the meantime, let the feast begin.”
“Oh, how ridiculous of me!” Sherlock proclaimed with a roll of his eyes.  “I ought to have realized it when you came to visit after McGonagall.  What are you, then, official cake tester to wizardkind?”
He soon found himself standing before the front doors leading out towards the grounds themselves.  A trip into Hogsmeade might have been a possibility, had he not struck it down almost as soon as he had the thought.  On a practical level, he would need to return to the flat to retrieve his coat and a handful of coins.  At the back of his mind, whispering to him from a part of himself that he tried to ignore, he knew that the real reason why he didn’t want to go into Hogsmeade alone was the memory of what happened during his last trip there.  He attempted to remind himself that his worries were ridiculous, even if they were founded; it was during the day, not to mention the middle of a school week, and Doyle would be forced to remain in the castle until after classes ended.  Still, Sherlock couldn’t convince himself that the Three Broomsticks was an option, no matter how hard he attempted to delete the experience entirely.
John felt the concern etched in the set of McGonagall’s body as she watched the pair of them across the room.  “It is completely expected and more than understandable.  I do not believe Harry doubts your skill here, John, but you must remember what it is you are protecting.  You have gone through the feeling of loss a thousand times over; those who consider you to be a friend would like to help you avoid more.”
“I should hope so,” the man replied as he grabbed John’s hand, his enormous one practically encompassing John’s.  “I’m Sherlock Holmes, her teacher.”
“I’m not sure yet.”  Sherlock’s gaze fell to the ground and suddenly he was crawling across the grass on his hands and knees.  He let out a cry of success and sat up on his haunches, holding something out to John.  Holding his palm out, John watched as Sherlock dropped a single osiria rose petal into his hand.  “He’s left us a trail.  He wants us to follow.”
John shot her a weak smile and covered his eyes with a hand.  “I’d never neglect the opportunity to show someone how amazing he is, and he’s naturally exaggerated enough just being himself for me to change anything.  I need to get back to 221b to make sure it’s going all right.”
“Well, whatever it is, he was made to be with kids.”  The two continued to watch as Sherlock spoke quietly to Cecelia, lifting papers to gesture at something on them and add commentary.  Although there was no way for her to understand the scientific gibberish he spoke, she watched intently as though completely riveted, occasionally murmuring back and attempting to grab at the sheets.  Sherlock always managed to keep them just out of reach, shooting her a warm smile at every attempt.  John felt himself echoing the smile without intending to, enjoying the sight as though she actually were Sherlock’s own.  Though unrelated biologically, John had considered Sherlock as a secondary parent to her since they discovered she existed, holding just as important a role in Cecelia’s life as Mary or him.  He wasn’t entirely sure how healthy such an idea was, but it was true all the same.
Cecelia let out a shout when she spotted Harry, letting go of Sherlock’s hand to rush over to him.  Harry knelt to pick her up and settle her on his hip, giving her a hug and a kiss on the cheek.  John, meanwhile, held a hand out to Sherlock for him to take and brought him in tight to his side.
The sky had just started to turn cloudy as they left, so John headed back towards home, stopping briefly at Tesco again to pick up necessities.  By the time they’d finished, the sky had opened up to release an enormous fall rainstorm, the water so thick it was nearly impossible to see through it.  John glanced down at Cecelia in her normal jacket without a proper hood and made a quick decision.  Pulling the pram’s short covering over her to protect her as much as he could, he pulled up the collar on his jacket and made a run for the alley right next to the shop.
“Let’s solve the case first, then we’ll see how things go,” John replied with a wink. Niall fanned himself as he passed through into the dressing room and John laughed before turning back to address Sherlock properly. “Anyone in particular I should talk to tonight? You have permission to speak at any time; I won’t put that condition in this time since we can’t talk to each other during the mingling anyway.”
“I’m sorry I could not do more,” Snape replied, watching the pair with a thoughtful expression.  “If I can think of anything that might be of use, I will of course contact you immediately.”
“And you love my cock,” he replied with a mischievous grin.  John pulled him into a quick kiss and started to walk them backwards to their room.
Christmas morning began with a far too early wakeup as John was roused from their bed by a Gryffindor who had been tricked into taking a particularly bad Weasley product from a mischievous James Potter.  After telling him off with a threat to expose him to both his mother and grandmother, he sent the boys back to their dormitory and returned to Sherlock warm and asleep in bed.
to, it’s more…it sounds ridiculous now, after all we’ve already done this week, but I didn’t want to do
A week later, John hadn’t managed to convince Sherlock to talk to Mycroft.  By the time they got home the night they visited the Holmes parents, it was after midnight and they both were exhausted.  After being reassured by Mrs. Hudson that all was well and checking in on a sleeping Cecelia, John dragged Sherlock to their bedroom.  Sherlock briefly hesitated, shifting from foot to foot in the doorway, but his tiredness finally won out.  With hardly enough energy to check that the baby monitor was close by and to slip out of their shoes, they both flopped into bed and were asleep instantly.
“Normal is boring,” Sherlock murmured into John’s hair.  “You’d never be able to settle for normal.”
“Mary’s a metamorphmagus; Teddy spotted her instantly.  We need to get the both of you out of here, Mrs. Hudson too if we can.”  John reached into his sleeve to pull out his wand.  “I don’t know how much you’ve read on it, but I’m making you a Portkey.  I’ll set it for five minutes from now to take you to Harry’s.  That’s going to be our best option for the moment.”
“Where’d you find this?” John asked, waving the flower slightly.  “And what’s all this about anyway?”
He eventually found the classroom, the all black door stark against the cream of the corridor walls.  Before knocking, he peered in through the window to search for Olivia.  Her tawny head popped up in the far corner, waving a book in her hand and talking avidly with three of her classmates.  John smiled to himself and rapped his knuckles on the door, quickly ducking out of view in case Olivia looked his way.
“Sorry, just…yeah, sorry,” he said as he pushed himself heavily to his feet. Some of his usual enthusiasm returned as he looked them over and he cracked a small grin. “Damn, boys. Subtle but nicely done. Is that – “
“That would be lovely,” she replied, staring at Sherlock over the top rims of her spectacles.  The two continued to stare one another down, neither moving in a silent showdown.  Surprisingly, Sherlock found his eyelids fluttering downward towards the floor, an expression of reluctant submission falling over his face.  He let out a loud huff of annoyance and jumped to his feet, tossing down his violin in his recently vacated chair and storming into the kitchen.  He spent a moment fussing with the tea tray, organizing everything with an unnecessary loudness that carried nearly downstairs.  Moments later, the readied tea tray sat between them, the woman with a slightly cooled cup in her frail hands and Sherlock returned to his seat, violin once more in hand.  He glared over the tray at the woman as she took a sip, gaze eventually drawing back to his.
“All right?” John asked Sherlock once he was gone, staring down at where his hand clenched his glass with concern.  Sherlock nodded tersely before draining it and reaching for the other.
“Well, can’t have you cold, can we?  Would you let me buy you a coffee to warm up you up and tell you how sorry I am for pelting you with a snowball?”
Before he could actually touch him, Sherlock jolted awake, knocking the book in his lap to the floor.  The heavy tome thudded loudly and in seconds Cecelia was awake and screeching her displeasure.  When Sherlock made to stand, John put a hand on his knee and shook his head to stop him.
“Not a problem,” John replied.  He looked over at Sherlock, meeting his eyes in a moment.  Sherlock nodded short enough for it to be barely noticeable and adjusted Cecelia on his hip.
“Does this mean we’re dating?” he asked, trying to hide his fear and failing. John wrapped his arms around Sherlock’s waist to pull him in even closer.
“No time like the present, then, I guess,” Teddy replied, the half grin on his face morphing into a beaming smile.  “You don’t think we’re too young?”
Somehow he was always aware of Sherlock, however.  Whether he was simply sitting silently in the seat beside him or attempting to get him to swallow down countless cups of tea, John could always sense when Sherlock was in the room.  The sensation tinged beneath his skin as though he had a homing device directly connected to the man, alerting him of his every move to reassure him that this time it was Sherlock attempting to comfort him, Sherlock urging him to open up and talk, to eat and sleep and care for himself in one of the many ways John always attempted to care for him.  Though currently unable to express it, the mere fact that he was not mourning Sherlock this time around, let alone that the man was watching over him with anxious devotion, was enough to comfort him completely.
"Agreed, though your concerns are groundless. I've already tried a handful of spells using your wand and mastered them with a bit of work. I highly doubt I am capable of 'blowing us all up to hell.'"
“Well, there aren’t many of them – it’s a rare gift to have, and I’ve personally only known two of them, and even then they were related.  So it theoretically should be easy to narrow down which one it is, but because of the skills they have, if they want to hide…well, it’s pretty easy for them to do.”
“Mycroft has done things that I thought were awful before, but this…”  Sherlock’s voice, when it finally came from the area of John’s shoulder, was muffled by the fabric he nearly had stuffed into his mouth.  “It’s too much.  John, I – “
“But she had her wand.  That means she couldn’t possibly be the metamorphmagus we’re looking for, unless the wand we have isn’t hers or she managed to get a new one.”
John sat back down beside Sherlock who pouted “That case was a 10 an I missed out on it, yet Greg solved it” he quietly bemoaned John just giggled.
“I am going to have so much fun when all this comes to a head. But first I still have so much to do and a wedding to prepare for. The Government is marrying the Inspector” With that Eurus exited and headed downstairs to plan.
Sebastian leaned his head back as the truck pulled onto Warwick Lane. The streets were a little hard to navigate. Panic as it was due to four explosions in the city, each site barricaded and guarded. Of course the police network was down; Mycroft’s little government operation too. Sebastian used the same hacker that got into the networks to broadcast Jim’s message to tie up their systems garages that wouldn’t open to let vehicles out, fake reports. It was all very splendid and so smart.
“Please let them know my well wishes for a speedy recovery,” Lestrade said. Anthea nodded and headed back to the room.
“I thought they were dead. I woke up in the hospital a scared little girl and a man tells me my family is dead but he had a new family for me.” Willa worked her arms against the roped holding her. “I didn’t have the reaction Eurus wanted. How could I hate Mycroft and Sherlock, when it was her actions that caused everything. Yes Mycroft kept it a secret. He had to. But she, Eurus, she tried to kill me.”
The guest cheered as Greg took Mycroft’s hand in his and they pulled each other close to walk back down the aisle towards the house.
“If it is at all possible please allow him to stay in this bed with me. It is of no discomfort to me. Of course if it’s is a detriment to him then of course he should be moved to his own bed.” Sherlock said
But He would be able to do what he did, to see the things he could see if he let emotion get in the way. Mycroft had always said that caring was not an advantage. Sherlock struggled with that. He could see Mycroft’s point but at the same time. Caring for Willa had always brought him good things. But others. He let Victor close, but he didn’t care for him. Not really. He only really cared about the drugs.
The door opened and Sherlock entered, he looked like hell. He was sober, and freshly showered but he was a mess, a large bruise marred the left side of his face, and more covered his arms and shoulders when he pulled off his shirt to start getting dressed his torso was also covered in bruises.
“Yes, Sir!” Sholto replied saluting. He took another look at the mess the explosive left and headed to round up the rest of the private security firm.
“You are no intrusion, you are a friend of Sherlock and John’s and of Greg, and you are a very valuable part of their lives” Daddy Holmes said with a smile. “I know they feel horrible that you were injured as well” Daddy Holmes continued as he helped Molly settle.
John looked up at the building; if you didn’t know better you would think that nothing had ever happened there. Even Speedy’s was fully rebuilt. It had taken the owners a while to reopen though. John couldn’t blame them.
Greg leaned down and kissed Rosie’s forehead and gave Sherlock another hug before he and Mycroft left.
“I want you to officially adopt Rosie. I want you and I listed as her fathers. I want her name to be Rosamund Alice Martha Watson-Holmes” John said moving and resting his head on Sherlock’s shoulder. “ And I would like to be John Hamish Watson-Holmes.”
“Thanks” He replied giving her a squeeze back. “This is awful, but, I’m relieved. You must think that is horrible of me.”
The special guests left and Greg and Mycroft each shared a dance with Mummy Holmes, Anthea and John dance as Sherlock and Molly joined in. Soon the dance floor was full and the guests were happily dancing away to some 70’s pop tune. Brodie was really showing his moves in his chair as he dance away with Molly.
“He’s not fully back in the swing of things.” Molly replied. Brodie nodded “There are a few blood samples from Mr. Underwood, may have some tissue samples later”
“She hid an injury from the blast, a piece of shrapnel that pierced her side, her only thoughts were giving birth to a healthy baby” Mummy said
I post links on Instagram and Tumblr to my stories and someone asked me about my descriptions of stuff and what’s around the area. I go off of Google maps and for what’s around 221B Baker Street I go off of what is on the real Baker Street even though the one on screen is on North Gower.  For the MET I am using the old location on Victoria and Broadway even though they have moved into their new headquarters on Victoria Embankment back in November of 2016, but I am going off the thought that S4 is not set in 2017 as it starts right after Abominable Bride. So yeah, that’s how I come up with places and things around Baker Street, The MET and the Diogenes. Thank you to my friend Rhodey-Loves-Tony (not her URL she won’t let me link) for the question
“This is fun, you’re like one of those blow up weighted punching balloons people buy for kids” Sebastian laughed as he pushed John again sending the shorter man swaying.
Brodie Wellington-McTavish had come to St. Bart’s pathology department from Kinlochleven via the British Royal Navy, where he was a marine. He had joined the navy to get out of his small city and due to his test results had been placed in the Marines. He figured the military was a good way to have his education paid for. What he didn’t expect was for a war to break out in Afghanistan. So he had been sent over Kabul, Kandahar, Helmand, and had even been posted over to Iraq twice.
“But James won’t fight unless provoked.” John spoke up. “even with Williamson was drunk and taking shots. It’s what makes him a great commander. He’s cool under pressure.”
The bone saw, still rotating as the explosion rocked the morgue, came to rest on her chest. The blade now embedded in her sternum, the pain that radiated trough her body with every breath was stabbing. The body she had been working on was now laying on her, the blood running down and mingling with her own.
“Don’t worry Moriarty and I had a plan in motion already, but now it will have to wait, they need to heal for it for to be really fun” Eurus smiled
Another truck went to opposite way filled with concrete tank stoppers. Not the normal traffic to travel down Baker Street. The again if any other the other streets were blocked due to an accident this would be the logical reroute.
“By the power invested in me by the British Government, So basically Mycroft, I now pronounce you, Husband and Husband. You may now kiss.”
Sherlock struggled to remain calm. What was wrong. He was getting betting, he hadn’t been sick he had been nervous about the group session but not sick.
“You know, usually when I get this agitated tone Lestrade and the others know to shut up, what makes you so special.” Sherlock said turning on his heel and coming within inches of Dimmock’s face.
She looked out at the garden below, the grave yard they played in as kids, all the wrong dates, a joke of the architects. They should all be waking soon. Then the fun could begin.
One might ask why he stayed in it. What else was he to do? He had started university but didn’t finish. His mouth got in him trouble, but it wasn’t his fault most of the world was stupid and limited.
Rosie reached up and wiped one away from his cheek and giggled as she laid her head on Sherlock’s shoulder.
“Stop it!” John spoke up harshly. “You think you childhood was so bad Eurus because your family loved you, but didn’t play the way you wanted to play. That’s nothing. Try being beaten when your father is drunk, or when he’s sober and couldn’t afford alcohol, or when he was in withdrawal. Being kicked out of your house because you kissed a boy. Living on the streets, till joining the army so you can afford medical school because all you want to be in life is a doctor, to help people. To be a kind doctor like you ones you met at the hospital as a child being cared for after a beating. You just sound like an entitled spoiled brat who mopped because she didn’t get her way.”
There was an eerie giggle and then the far TV sprang to life. There was a forest, an oddly familiar forest.
“Elijah darling we will be making a small trip soon. John has his final group therapy on Monday. We need to go see Sherlock. John will need Sherlock after that session.” Eurus said as she neared the glass.
“John. I don’t know if I can protect you and I don’t want you getting into the middle of any of this. I almost lost you once and I can’t do that again. I, I think you should go with Rosie and Mrs. Hudson.” Sherlock said taking John’s hands.
John bounded down the last two steps to the landing and helped Mrs. Hudson to the ground as the wall in front of them blew inwards.
He looked over at Mycroft he had just exited the changing area. Gone were the polos, tee-shirts and jeans, and kakis he’d worn on vacation, back into the three piece fine pressed suits. Not that Greg would complain, he loved how tailored the suits were to Mycroft’s body, how they showed every curve and contour.
Sebastian blinked his eyes against the lights. Slowly his surroundings came into focus. He wasn’t dead, he was in a hospital, an institutional one, no windows a guard at the foot of the bed.
“Not the answer I want Gregory” Sebastian said. A shot ran out, a small gasp of pain escaped Donovan’s mouth. “That was in her leg, she can survive a bullet in the leg, with enough help. Next one is in her head.”
John eased himself onto the bed, every muscle ached, twenty-two and a half hours straight of surgery. All base medic personnel was on duty, the doctors fueled by nothing but coffee and quick bites of snacks that the mess tent officers had brought. An encampment of refugees looking to leave Afghanistan were attacked, the encampment was not too far from the base, and so all victims were transported here. There we almost 95 patients that went through their doors even at Camp Bastion the busiest military hospital in Afghanistan it was too much and pushed the doctors to their limits. The victims ranged from newborn to elderly, and it was not just refugees, soldiers and aid workers that had been helping out and private security that had been hired to help as well. Injuries went from DOA to minor burns and cuts. Everyone was triaged and sorted, and just when they thought they were done more would flood in. There was nowhere else they could go, this base was the only one that could take them.
“No Sherlock, you’re still playing favorites” the corners of Eurus’s lips curled up as she starred in to camera.
Ashton stood and cheered loudly as one of the venue assistance brought a bouquet of flowers out to present to Marisol.
Mrs. and Mr. Holmes were so sweet and caring, and very nurturing. Molly almost giggled at how both must have the patience of a saint to handle Mycroft and Sherlock as they grew. And she didn’t even know their names. Everyone just called them Mum or Dad, even Anthea. It was just that parental instinct and quality. Molly was sure she had heard Mrs. Hudson call them Beth and Thomas but she wasn’t entirely too sure. Even when she tried calling them Mr. and Mrs. Holmes Molly had been corrected that Mum and Dad were just fine to use.
"Medical personnel is on its way. Can she be moved, would it be better to lay her on the catwalk?" The man asked
The night moved on and they headed home. No Honeymoon for the two, they didn’t want to leave London. Just a promise from Mycroft and the Met that no cases would come their way for at least a week. Plus Rosie’s first Birthday was tomorrow, another big party was planned, this time at the zoo. Mycroft had arranged a special VIP event for them to feed the pygmy hippos, one of her favorite animals, the hippo.
So Sebastian and Jim aka Dublin692 set to meet in Dubai. Jim said he would be there on business. Sebastian had his flights from the Military, Jim would send someone to meet him at the airport and bring him to the hotel.
“A shot in the arm” Eurus spoke again “He can keep going, but he’ll lose blood and get weaker easier for the hound to catch him. One more missed riddle and it’s his leg”
Sebastian landed at the Dubai International Airport at noon. Waiting was a large well-dressed body guard looking guy with a sign that read Sebby.
Riley shuffled into the barracks. He smiled there was John fast asleep, his hands were going to be overly tanned from the sun beating in on them. Riley reached up and closed the window flap before sitting on his own bed. A shower would have been ideal but the men who were on duty today had already taken them over. Riley would have waited, but sleep was more important right now.
The shock to Mrs. Hudson had been when they were told that John had a fractured skull. She asked how he could have been moving around and doing everything he had been.
There was a pop then static. The phone line disconnected then started to ring again. Sherlock again put it on speaker phone.
“Sebastian was a mentally disturbed man to begin with. He joined the military specifically to blow stuff up and to shoot people. He was recruited by Moriarty and became his top man. And his lover. They killed a lot of people and they destroyed a lot of property and stole a lot of money. Sherlock put an end to that. And Sebastian retaliated. We never saw it coming. I wish there was a way to go back to prevent this all.”
“I, I can’t. I’ve never even held a gun before.” She said tears building in her eyes. “I can’t kill Irene; she’s a friend and a mother. Her child needs her.”
John stood up that was his stop. Back home to Baker Street. Mycroft’s men had done a wonderful job. The modifications they had suggested were perfect. The stairs were now on the opposite side to where they had been and Rosie’s room while still a floor up was close to Sherlock and John’s room. They also now had a small sitting area just inside their door for clients to wait, the rest of the flat… it looked exactly the same, even had the bullet hole in the wall with the smiley face. There was one difference though. The bison skull did not make the return; neither Sherlock nor John ever wanted to look at anything similar again. Instead Greg had found a wonderful stuffed stag head and neck on a traditional mount. It had been at one of the antique stores he and Mycroft had gone to on a Sunday afternoon. It was mounted between the windows proudly wearing the headphones. Sherlock had named it Bambi; John had just laughed and shook his head.
Greg had been moved into the house as well, his healing was taking a bit longer, he had developed an infection in his stomach and that set back his recovery by a few weeks.
Mycroft’s eyes were fixed on the other half of the spilt screen, the little boy playing without a care in the world, unaware of his mother’s death not too far away.
“I was actually sort of hoping you would be here. It’s always nice to see a friendly face.” Judy smiled as she sat “Are you still waiting for your friend this week”
“Everything is in there. I suspect you have drawn some hypotheses as to why you are looking into this case. But this will clarify things.” Anthea said as the car started making its way back into the city. “Have there been any more calls from Mr. Stamford?”
John watched as Sherlock and the Dimmock walked through the crime scene for the fifth time. There were no origami Black Lotus anywhere.
Sherlock was heading to the bluff, rescuing a child first how quaint. Eurus exited the shed and headed towards the house. A few more matches added to the other side would speed up the process.
Well Greg had always pictured a few kids running around as well, but with him in his 50’s it wouldn’t be fair of to have a child now. Constantly being mistaken for a grandparent, no it was too late for them to have any of their own, but Greg vowed and so did Mycroft, to be the best uncles they could for Rosie. And Mycroft had certainly vowed that she would want for nothing as she grew older.
As they neared Greg and Mycroft saw that is was just John, Sherlock, Anthea and two guards. Sherlock had a look of anger on his face that sent shivers through Greg.
Sebastian glared at Dalton before looking at the carnage in front of him. The front of 221 Baker Street no longer existed, in its place was a gaping hole giving those outside a glimpse into what was remaining of the sitting area and kitchen.
“The Kobayashi Maru was designed as a no win scenario to test and develop character” Mycroft spoke up.
“Perhaps” Sherlock smiled as Judy got up and headed off the little one squirming the entire way out of the park.
Greg had attended over 20 sometimes doing up to four funerals a day all for various officers and support personnel of the MET who he had known. Today there had only been one and this morning’s had been the hardest, the one for Sally Donovan. Her father had met Greg at the church doors, he wanted Greg to be an honorary pallbearer and walk alongside the casket. Greg had agreed. Dimmock and Anderson were the only pallbearers Sherlock had recognized; the other DI and the forensics tech had been out on a case and had not been injured. There were many faces in the congregation that they recognized as well, people who had worked cases with Greg, or had been at crime scenes Sherlock had visited.
“You know what. I don’t want to hear it.” Greg said shoving the file at Mycroft. “You don’t keep information like this from you future husband.”
Mycroft, Sherlock, Greg, John and Willa watched in horror as Henry fell to the ground. They shook as the low howl got closer.
John could hear the sounds of Sherlock pacing and muttering. He was agitated, more so than John had ever known him to be. The solitary confinement and the object covering his head and face we most certainly causing the most agitation.
“My Dearest Gregory. We had a rough start, I can be closed off. But you have stuck with me though think and thin. Through dangers untold and hardships unnumbered you have won your way here into my heart beyond the ice wall I had built to win my love to reactivate my emotions that had been locked away, for you will is as strong as mine and our love is great. You have a wonderful enchanting power over me! I vow that I will Comfort you when Arsenal loses I be there after long nights of hard cases. You are the love of my life and you make me happier than I could ever imagine and more loved than I ever thought possible... You have made me a better person. I take you to be my partner for life, I promise above all else to live in truth with you, And to communicate fully and fearlessly, I give you my hand and my heart. As a sanctuary of warmth and peace, and pledge my love, devotion, faith and honor as I join my life to yours.”
Mrs. Hudson passed him up the phone, which was good he didn’t know if he could bend down again right now.
After a three almost four week stay in the hospital John and Sherlock were released. Mycroft had a room set up for them at his house, Sherlock while grateful for the extension of caring had a first been weary of moving in with big brother.
Sebastian had asked to be the one trained on John; He wanted to be the one to kill the meddling doctor if it came down to that. He already had the pleasure of aiming at him before at the pool. Oh how he wanted to pull that trigger and send John sprawling backwards with his blood staining the tiles.
“He is well” Mycroft replied stiffly, he did not like Eurus knowing that he was engaged. He had given Mummy and Daddy permission to post the announcement but never even thought about Eurus seeing it.
Sherlock gently poured the water over John’s head rinsing the suds from his hair. John had been released from the hospital in the morning. He was quiet and still so weak. He trembled when he stood and would lean on Sherlock for support while walking. Sherlock had drawn a bath for John and now sat behind him in the tub gently washing his hair.
"Ah, you needed the money. Army doctor, high action, not a lot of pay really. Plus it's a good free ride home after a whirlwind trip to Paris… with your fellow soldier and companion… who is not a redhead, Willa will be disappointed." Sherlock smiled "What's your name?"
“You like puzzles Sherlock. Let’s have some puzzles” She gave an eldritch smile almost equally ghostly music started to play. “How about some riddles. You solve my riddles and Henry lives. You fail and he dies.”
John reached up and guided Sherlock’s lips to his. He pressed his lips against Sherlock as had as his body would allow him. Sherlock wrapped his arms around John and hugged him in tight, sliding his hand down John’s chest and in between his legs. John moaned at Sherlock’s gentle touch, it sent shivers through his body. Sherlock smiled and continued as John bit down gently onto Sherlock’s lip.
Sherlock had offered to come in with him but John said he would be alright on his own. Sherlock and Rosie could go enjoy the beautiful evening in the park.
Wheels squeaked in the doorway. Sherlock looked to see Willa being pushed into the room by her boyfriend Aston. Both her wrists were casted, and she was in a wheelchair because her tuck and roll technique was not foolproof and she had injured some muscles in her hip.
“Much of Kenneth Branagh's 2006 film As You Like It, was filmed on location at Wakehurst.” Flora said with a smile
Mycroft looked at the monitor. Greg and John were talking to Willa. They had no volume, but from the lip reading he could do they had volume.
“We’re keeping our names, at least for now, we’re in this army life for the long hull, and with the ways, things are there are going to be a lot more tours. So best keep things simple.” John smiled.
A few nights a week she would come over with the ingredients and walk Sherlock though the recipes. Sherlock had remarked that it was just like chemistry making sure everything went in in the right measurements.
“Ah Everett that guy who did up the Valentines dinner invites for parliament, he’s got a great eye for design” Greg smiled “He said his door is always open, we’ll stop by on our way home. And then you are mine and all mine for the rest of the day. We’re going to lie in bed and do nothing but maybe watch the match tonight on the big telly.”
Mary and Mycroft were still in the sitting area, Mycroft had stood and was getting ready to head out.
“I, I need to go home Sherlock” John said quietly. He looked up as Judy stood and Elijah waved. “Oh you’re busy”
I had a few people on Tumblr ask and message me. Asked me if I was ok lol. I do these horrible things to characters as my writing is my therapy. I write when, angry, sad, frustrated, you name it. Been doing it since I was a teenager when I decided that I was going to hurt a fictional character instead of myself. Even into my adulthood I do this. I work a job that can produce very high stress levels sometimes and instead of internalizing it or taking the frustration, stress and anger out on myself or others I write. This story is not the only one I am currently working on but it is the one I am working on the most as I write it after work. It’s is my decompression and stress release. Thank you
The crowd clapped as Jimmy and Robert wished them a happy marriage. Greg and Mycroft went over and pictures were taken and hands shaken.
Sherlock held Rosie tight with one arm and raced forward scooping up the little guy before he reached the water. He fussed but Sherlock held him close as he walked back to the woman who was carefully standing, as he neared Sherlock noticed a brace on one of the women’s legs.
“She left.” Roo sobbed out. “Packed a bunch of stuff and left. Said we have to be out of the house by the end of the week as she’s listing it.”
“I’m telling you all I know!” Greg replied trying to not let the fear overshadow the anger in his voice. He looked into the elevator Donovan’s blood now running along the tilted floor and pooling in the far left corner.
Sebastian turned and moved Jim onto the bed. He slowly worked his way down Jim’s chest stopping to suck on his nipple.
“First photo she ever asked for was of Sherlock, the Willa, and then you, Greg, Molly, and Mrs. Hudson. Then Rosie.” Anthea said still looking down.
“I am glad you feel that way. I would love to be William Sherlock Scott Watson-Holmes” Sherlock smiled.
“Just like John believed that he was pouring out his heart to a widowed cancer survivor you thought you were bonding with a boy and his disabled mother. You told me lots about your relationship. Without having to say many words at all.” Eurus said
John examined him more, lots of cuts, and bruises but nothing else major was presenting itself. So John went to the bedroom and got the blanket to cover Sherlock. When he returned Mrs. Hudson was kneeling next to Mary.
“Very good Sherlock, you’ve escaped and the child is saved. But in turn the water is falling harder on dear doctor Watson and Wilhelmina is burning.” Eurus said into the earpiece.
“Thank you again Sherlock” Judy said standing. “Perhaps I will see you and Rosie again here another day”
John kissed his forehead as he laid down beside him. Rosie yawned. Sherlock started to hum her song. John closed his eyes and was soon asleep.
“I thought I would try being a bit more human” Mycroft said looking at Greg “My wise husband let me know that caring and sentiment is not always a bad thing when dealing with life”
John nodded and moved in closer to Sherlock. He wrapped his arms around him and held him close, head resting on Sherlock’s chest. He was trembling. Sherlock wrapped his arms around him and kissed to top of his head. Hopefully eventually, they would both be alright.
Sherlock hung his coat up and went to sit in his chair. John sat in his own as Mary, Lestrade and Mycroft found seats.
“He’s finally letting people get close; I’m just saying if he’s letting you in, you should let him in as well.” Diane spoke
She would be unconscious for a while when she did wake, how would he tell her, Ashton was dead, Multiple gunshot wounds at a close range. Victor had really been out for blood. Mycroft had already fired the entire team that had botched the mission to arrest Victor when Sherlock had first called.
Well, John and Riley would be supportive. Sholto had pulled a lot of strings to keep them together on deployments. They worked well together and what they got up to alone played no part in the medical work. He’d recruited D’Helley to help. That’s how Riley and John found out about the two men.
The slightly shorter man was lying on his stomach arm draped over the other’s chest. They could relax here, their security was good. Their own private villa with their own pool with view of the sea and beach access, in a non-extradition country, life was good.
John stepped closer to Riley, he wanted to be close, but he knew that while the commanding officers really didn’t care what their soldiers got up to in their personal lives, they had to respect the locals and that meant same-sex couples couldn’t show affection in public.
“We could shift the stairs to the other side putting Rosie’s room closer to yours and use the extra space to create a waiting room, for your consulting detective cases, if you are still going to continue those” Mycroft inquired.
“I picked up my gun and contemplated using on myself for the first time on March 12; I met you on January 29
Then Sherlock jumped Mycroft became distant, at first Greg could understand Mycroft had just lost his little brother but after a while it was different Mycroft wasn’t mourning Sherlock actually he hardly mentioned him it was weird. When Greg tried to help him Mycroft distanced himself more. Then Sherlock miraculously returned the bastard faked his own death, and Mycroft knew about it kept it from everyone kept it from John. Greg couldn’t deal with it he was so mad but when he finally went to Mycroft to try and work things out Mycroft would not even talk to him Greg didn’t know what he did wrong, he had had every right to be mad at Mycroft. They didn’t speak except for after Sherlock was shot, when Greg went to Mycroft to try and help find out where Sherlock had went.
The meeting continued with the others talking about their own progression. Joey finally donated all his father’s clothes and cleaned out his father’s flat. Patricia had started talking to her sister again. And Karen, Karen was starting to go out more. Not just for doctors or therapy but to go for walks in the park, she went and saw a movie. She went to her husband and son’s graves. She said that was the biggest step for her. She hadn’t been back since the funeral and she wasn’t sure if she would ever return.
The first dance was beautiful, there was no space left between them as they danced. Half way though they picked up Rosie and held her close as they danced.
He kept up his pre-injury gym routine to the best of his ability, he went and finished his school focusing on more of the lab assistant/lab tech aspect then the actual coroner.
“No you’re losing blood and have that heavy thing on you, best to recline and not stress yourself out.” The Medic said as they started moving him over to the other helicopter.
Molly, Brodie and little Charles Alexander were now practically family to them. All they had been though, it brought them all closer.
“The doctors said Willa would never wake up. So we went along with Sherlock’s rewritten memories. Mum and Dad would visit her while we were in school.” Mycroft said looking down at his hands. “Then she woke. Against all odds she woke up, just before her 4
“Well richer men then you don’t really want this war going in favor of the Americans, and since you’re on their side, you’re on the losing side.” Moriarty smiled.
“Shock collars” Eurus explained “Set to a high voltage, it won’t kill you, but it will make you wish it did. One false move and I will set them off.”
“Dimmock said the victims were known drug users and dealers. But they are not the main distribution; he’s looking to see where they get it from” Sherlock said as John nodded. “The blood is fascinating. The luminol was starting to cause some clotting but not enough to be detrimental to their health. That and it looks like it was injected close to their death.”
Mycroft balled up his fists. When he got his hand on them, he didn’t know what he would do but it would be painful.
Agent Keinfeld’s body rolled onto her legs she shifted her weight to roll him onto the ground which allowed her to stand, the area was still smoky and the smell of the explosives lingered. The entrance way was blocked by debris and she could see the unmistakable arm of Agent Weatherson sticking out from the rubble. She gingerly moved her bleeding arm, the pain was not too bad, and she could move her wrist and all her fingers, she could move all her fingers on her other arm too just didn’t want to because of the pain.
“33 degrees and not a cloud in Floridian sky according to this weather app.” John said looking at his mobile phone as he exited the bed room. He had the day off he and Sherlock were working on a case Dimmock brought them while Rosie napped.
Sherlock's grip tightened as he gave John one last final stroke sending John into a blissful orgasmic state.
But all that was gone now. Jim was taken away from him. By Molly Hopper and Mycroft Holmes who helped Sherlock fake his death. By Detective Inspector Gregory Lestrade who never waned from believing in Sherlock Holmes, and by Doctor John Watson, the one who never gave up on Sherlock, the same John Watson who reported Sebastian’s first under the table deal with the Afghan forces. The same John Watson who got Sebastian discharged from the royal marines.
“Please find out if everyone is ok” Molly said as the Paramedics came to kneel by her and began working.
“No behave Sherlock. The bridles of the past have been known to have a rope on them to be pulled. My bridle was specially designed for my use on you. It has a chain. And I have enlisted two of my men to take turns yanking it when I give them a signal” Eurus said as she walked around the small shed by the house. She could see everything from here.
Anthea helped Daddy Holmes get him settled again, her side was not as sore as it had been and she was glad to be a bit more independent and mobile.
“Wrong answer!” Sebastian said pulling the trigger. There was no sound from Sally Donovan as the bullet entered her head just above her eye.
“She is not that innocent. She played quite the part in your little fake death leap off of St. Bart’s. She’s aided you in most of your cases and therefore, really I wasn’t thinking I should have brought her here.” Eurus gave an eerie chuckle. “We will call her; you will try to convince her, break her heart. If you do not, I will kill her. She’ll experience another big blast. But don’t let on that you are under any duress or that you are lying. I want to see her cry, I want to see her hate you for ruining her life again. Brodie’s phone and the phone at the hospital have all be set to go directly to voicemail should she try and contact him to say anything. Brodie himself has been swamped with samples so he will not even have time to call and check on her till after his shift.”
The voices were speaking again, still in German. She heard her name, Sherlock’s and something about the MET.
“Let’s forget lunch and see if some of those moves you talked about in the chatroom are as pleasurable in person” Jim said pulling him towards the bedroom.
“OK” Greg replied, knowing he would take the tray back to the kitchen when he was done. Even after all this time living with Mycroft, Greg still wasn’t used to be waited on.
“That dress, the one we put her in for her 6 month photos. Mycroft said… That man really does have a hard time with the truth doesn’t he?” John said as he began to pace again.
John, Greg and Willa’s hands were untied and they were pulled to a standing position. They were led out of their room and down a hall, the door opened and they were shoved into Irene’s room.
“Evening Mr. Lestrade” Tabitha said setting down the tray “Mr. Holmes is sorry but he will not be able to join you for dinner again tonight, he has to take some more phone calls”
“You put him on trial for stealing the crown jewels. He didn’t steal them, he merely wanted to see them up close” Sebastian smiled.
John knelt to check on Sherlock again. He was still unconscious. He moved to the mantle again and reached into the small crevice between books. It was empty, Sherlock’s gun was gone. That is where he had last placed it, before they left for Christmas. It was John’s gun they had at Appledore, John’s gun which now set in a lock up somewhere in an office of the government.
Mycroft had introduced him to her way back when they first started dating. She was sweet. She was around 6 feet tall, her waist length hair was almost entirely black except for a wide white streak on the right side. Over a scar from the accident that killed her birth family, she had said.  She played the cello like no one Greg had heard before, so flawlessly and the melodies she played were so hauntingly beautiful.
“I can talk now” John said. He looked down at his hands and took a deep breath before starting to talk. He didn’t tell them details like that Mary was an assassin or who Sherlock was. In fact he didn’t use names at all. He didn’t give exact details about why they were in the explosions, just that they were near there.
“I hope your mom makes the cake, that chocolate cherry one she makes is divine,” John said taking Riley’s hand as they entered one of the private skyping booths the American USO had set up there.
“Very good Mycroft. You know all about fish don’t you. You compared people to fish. Called them Goldfish. I heard you that day. My contacts had been listening that day. And you took Sherlock’s advice. You got yourself a gold fish.”
Major James Sholto, their commanding officer, had stopped Riley on his way back to their bunk. John, Riley and the other main doctor Davidson were being given the next two days off. Kandahar had sent three relief doctors. Their allied doctors were being given the same treatment. They were arriving soon. The primary concern for military doctors right now was fatigue, and this pushed the team to its limits.
“It was your idea for Moriarty to stand trial and not disappear like you could have made him do. It was your idea to continue to game, to have Sherlock fake his death and try to dismantle the network.” Greg said standing in front of the desk. “If you are not going to place all the blame on those two evil whack jobs Moran and Moriarty, then you have to take some of the blame on yourself as well.”
“No” John replied as Sherlock read “I thought we would get a deadline. Moriarty gave us a deadline. 12 hours, 8 hours. This person hasn’t.”
“No.” Greg replied taking Mycroft’s hand in his. “I want you to come to bed, I want you there when I fall asleep and when I wake, I want to feel you next to me to know that you are alright.”
He turned as the door behind him opened. Marisol entered with Robbie who was being pushed in a wheelchair by a nurse.
The perfect wedding verse if I do say so myself. So Greg and Mycroft if you could please take to the dance floor”
The pink phone started to vibrate again. Sherlock put on his gloves and reached down for it. The name on the call display read M. Stamford. Sherlock furrowed his brow and answered, putting the phone on speaker.
“And now the rings” The officiant said taking them from Andrew “The Wedding ring. The circle was the symbol of eternity, with no beginning or end, to many ancient cultures. The hole in the center of the ring also had significance. It wasn’t just considered a space, but rather a gateway, or door; leading to things and events both known and unknown. To give a ring signifies never-ending and immortal love. As Gregory and Mycroft exchange rings they are in a way bonding themselves together with the symbolism of the rings.”
W? That was the name Sherlock had Irene Adler under in his phone, came from her professional persona as The Woman, Sherlock just shortened it to W.
“So if you let Sherlock live, do I have to give John back? I rather think I will like having him as a pet more than I would have Willa.” Victor said with a smirk.
Victor climbed up on the runway and surveyed the scene around him, those who could flee had already fled and those who were injured lay scattered about the venue. He looked down at the bleeding body of Ashton Everett he wasn't moving, and blood pooled around him. Victor smirked as he made his way down the catwalk.
Greg grabbed a brownie and a beer from the fridge and headed into the study. He and Mycroft had been going over some of the taskforces files when Sherlock had called about John. Greg sat at the desk and opened one up. It was on Irene and what the taskforce could find.
Molly shut her eyes. How could she be so stupid, she told herself there was no more getting scared, not everyone was someone looking to get to Sherlock though her. Brodie came highly recommended to the lab; he socialized well with others and he was perfect. He made her feel good, she was relaxed around him and if she misspoke he didn’t make her feel super awkward. She could run off at the mouth and say the wrong thing and he would just smile and add his own little jokes that made everything better.
"Like he took care of you before?" Willa said carefully watching as Brody moved on the tarmac overseeing the unloading of luggage. "How many times can we say you fell in the shower."
He traveled trying to recruit, using Greece and Bawnboy as home bases. Then last May he got a call. Someone wanted to help him in his endeavor to undo Sherlock and company.
John nodded as he looked down at Rosie who was sleeping comfortably in her baby sling head resting on John’s chest.
“My god, if Willa was three Eurus was four” Greg said. “A four year old trying to kill a three year old.”
“Dada!” She proudly exclaimed. John smiled. Rosie turned and booped Sherlock the same as she had John “Papa” She giggled. Sherlock allowed himself a small smile.
“Exactly Mycroft is the best thing that has happened to you since Margret showed her true colours.” Albert said motioning for Andrew to go inside “Connie, Andrew and Myself are going to go for a walk up to the park for a bit”
"Yes, we do. It's only polite." Willa smiled as the four buckled in take-off. Body dozed in his own seat already buckled in.
Greg smiled as he stretched. He’d never flown first class before and really he could make a habit out of it. The seat that fully reclined to a bed (fully flat bed with a quilted mattress, cotton duvet and pillow they even provided a pair of soft cotton pyjamas), the gourmet food (a menu to rival the wedding menu), Champagne to toast their wedding and a little toiletries kit he could keep. He felt like a rock star.
“I will be alright my love” Mycroft said as he eased himself up on the bed next to Greg. “There was irreparable damage to my lower leg so, it was removed. I have started some physio therapy but will not be fitted for a prosthesis until the stitches have fully healed.”
A loud clanging noise sounded down the end of the parking garage as the light when out and the emergency power came on. The intercom crackled to life.
“Not really much stock in that though is there?” The woman said running her hand up his arm, she was cold “That just paves the way for Sherlock and John to become a happy little family with the baby”
“Stop!” John said from the doorway between the kitchen and the sitting area. “Slippers, there’s glass everywhere.”
Greg opened a new file and started to read. He clenched his fist and slammed it down on the table. He closed the file and took it upstairs with him to get dressed.
The looks on Mycroft and Sherlock’s faces as they stood outside watching their lives go up in flames. Daddy wasn’t home that night he was at the hospital reading to Willa. Uncle Rudy was though; he’s the one who saw Eurus, saw her with the rest of the matches in her pocket, the fuel smell still on her hands.
Sherlock and John ran for the stairway doors only to find them locked and unmoving. The voice began to sing.
John looked down the hall at the bedroom. This could be a trick. Someone from Moriarty’s network could have somehow got the phone from Irene either before or after her execution. It would be the perfect addition to the network, black mail on some of the British elite.
Greg opened his eyes and looked at the engagement ring on his finger. Was Mycroft really ready for this step?
Mummy cried that night, and hugged Eurus, and she didn’t like it. Hugs always felt weird and uncomfortable.
Sherlock looked over at Willa if he had walked away, would she have still had her career? She loved it. Wasn’t it every little girl's dream to be famous a model or an actress, singer, maybe even all three. He wouldn’t ruin it for her. She was his world really. His first best friend, his only friend. Sure they fought sometimes but what siblings don’t.
He looked down at the little one her shoulders and head in his hands. All his focus had been on his little one that he had ignored Mary for the most part. Once he recognized that she was in labor he had stopped checking her, all his focus on the baby.
There was something hard around his neck, he tried to move it to turn his head but he could not, he tried to raise his left hand to see what was preventing this but it wouldn’t move either, it was held against him. His right hand was just as bad, it would move but not as fast as he would have liked it.
“I understand” Brodie said coming around the table and taking Molly’s hand “I wanted to ask you out the first day I met you but I didn’t want seem, creepy or needy”
It turned out everyone in there had lost someone in those attacks. John just looked down at his hands, so many lives lost because of Moran coming after him and Sherlock.
John held Rosie and Sherlock close as they made their way to the car that would take them back to the little bed and breakfast for the night.
“Ok” Greg whispered as he kissed Mycroft’s head just above his ear. “I won’t go. I’m sorry I yelled”
Mycroft let go of Greg’s hand and took hold of the side of the bed and carefully eased himself into a semi-balanced standing position. Greg looked at the compression bandage that stuck out from the cut off leg of the hospital pajamas.
"You'll be Major in no time." Willa smiled. "You hungry? Once we're in the air We can raid the galley, they keep it well stocked."
Sherlock was not himself, he was talking about concocting a case in his head to try and solve the mystery of the returning Moriarty.
“When Moriarty learned about me. He told Eurus, and of course she had to spring me. My skills were needed. Now second riddle. I need food to live. But if you give me water, I will die.” Victor asked
Riley stretched and curled up on his bed, soon he was in the blissful sleep that only exhaustion could bring.
Jim Moriarty sat at the desk looking out the window, the bright blue waters of the νοτιο στενο κερκυρας (notio steno kerkyras) the small gap in the Ionian Sea that separated Corfu from mainland Greece.
“Oh if you solve it, you can use your phone to text me. It will only text me, all others are blocked. It’s a neat little phone I picked up, supposed to be so kids. Perhaps if she survives we can give it to Willa.” Eurus smirked.
He’d heard a few stories from others about how he ended up at University College London – he only got in because his family was rich and paid off the council to let him attend, he got kicked out of his last uni for cooking drugs in the chem lab, he was on the run from someone in the government who was following him, among other more outlandish ideas. By the time he actually met the man, he didn’t expect the elegantly tall, cheek boned figure in a tight fit suit that frowned down at him.
“That’s fantastic!”  John had thought Lestrade looked as though he had been itching to share something with him the last time both he and Sherlock were at a crime scene together.  He assumed that Lestrade had wanted to wait until John’s own life settled down more before sharing the news, but he was thrilled to find out that they were getting on so well.  The two of them danced around each other almost as long as he and Sherlock, and they finally got themselves sorted out not long after Cecelia was born.  Since then, both of them were the happiest John had ever seen them.  He wouldn’t be surprised if they ended up engaged by the end of the year at the rate they were going.
They had set up a highchair in the kitchen for Cecelia the night before, so John placed her there and planted a kiss on her head.  She giggled and grabbed at his face, too slow to do any damage, before starting to pound on the plastic tray as he attached it.  He popped into the bedroom to snag the second monitor and put it between them on the table as he started to make his tea.
“No, this isn’t your fault,” John interrupted firmly.  “If he’s the one saying it unprovoked, then he’s to blame, not you.  You are never at fault for how cruelty done to you makes you feel.”  He calmed when Sherlock nodded his agreement and pulled him back into a hug.  “Do you want to talk to Minerva about this?  If he says these things to you in private, it’s possible he’s doing the same with others, including students, and that’s definitely not on.”
“I think I understand what you mean,” he eventually replied, John chuckling in response.  Once Cecelia finished covering the last section of the tree, John called her over to join them on the sofa again.  She climbed up to sit between them, reaching out for the smaller mug decorated with penguins ice skating on a pond.  Sherlock held it by the bottom for her as she blew across the frothy surface and took a sip.  She hummed happily and took a bigger drink, resting the mug in her cross legged lap.  Making sure she wouldn’t spill it first, Sherlock grabbed the other two mugs and passed one over to John with a small smile.
Sherlock gets involved in things he ought to have left well enough alone and...well...learns some...things.  About a certain former army doctor turned blogger.
“John?”  Sarah had peeked her head around the edge of the door, her face enthusiastic and hopeful.  John was just about to open up his sack lunch and his head shot around at the sound of her voice.  Internally, he groaned but he made sure to show nothing but pleasant welcome when he smiled back at her.  “I hate to do this to you on your lunch break, but could I ask you to do something for me?”
“That’s strange.  Didn’t Mycroft mention something about your family having magical connections?  This might be what he meant.”
"Then what’s the problem?” John exploded, rising to his feet.  “Jesus, Sherlock, would you just tell me?”
John took a long moment to consider before he replied.  “It was less difficult, coming back to the Muggle world rather than the wizarding one.  I felt useless after I got shot – I knew it was too late after my injury to do anything magically to fix my shoulder and obviously the army didn’t have Healers on hand to mend it when it happened.  It was my dominant arm, both for practicing surgery and magic, so I felt like I had little purpose left in either world.  And to be perfectly honest, it had been so long since I’d done any magic at that point…I wasn’t even sure if I could anymore.  What you saw earlier was the first time I’ve done magic since I joined the army.”
“Of course. Have a good evening, John, Sherlock.” With a wave, the two of them headed out into the night.
John kept one eye on them as he broke the seal on the parchment, noting the Hogwarts crest stamped into the wax.  He absentmindedly patted the bump that was Sherlock still below the blankets as he read.  A low purring of approval made its way out from under the covers and John grinned, shifting to reach his hand under to properly grab at him.  Just as he did, Cecelia appeared at their bedside.
After she thanked him, she rushed back to her room to grab her battered and well loved bee.  John and Sherlock met her at the front door and, after a final check of everyone’s clothes, they set off for the Great Hall.
“So were you planning on sneaking off alone while I slept or giving it a few days to properly plan?”  Sherlock’s voice was sharp and cutting when it broke through the quiet.  John’s head jolted up at his question, finding himself surprised despite all of the times he’d seen Sherlock do the same to countless others, not to mention himself.  He sighed and rubbed a hand down his face, the bristles of a beard tickling his palm.
The rest of the event passed in a blur for John. He felt even more in tune to Sherlock than usual, as though he sensed his vulnerability through the connection they created during the scene. They really didn’t need to speak, John feeling the slight trembles in Sherlock’s hands and arm when he needed him to be closer and Sherlock immediately coming back to John’s side when he noticed the uneasy turn of John’s mouth if he stepped too far away. They both let out a sigh of relief as the audience left for the evening and John immediately started to guide Sherlock to their dressing room.
.”  John’s voice was deadly quiet and stern, having instantly reverted into the memory of being a captain at the threat.  Sherlock flinched slightly at the sharpness but didn’t move.  The tall man slowly inched forward, wand pointed directly at Sherlock, and squinted into the darkness.
