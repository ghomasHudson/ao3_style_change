“How do you know about that?” Claire asked. “If you’re from the same time as he is, you shouldn’t even know angels exist.”
“But do you think he feels that way?” Dean asked. “I mean, think about it. Some stranger turns up in his life, says, ‘We need you for a job in the future. Come with me. You won’t remember it and have literally nothing to gain.’ And we put him at risk because there’s no way to do it without him, just to shed him like an old coat when he’s not useful anymore.”
Sam ran forward first, enwrapping Young Dean in a hug. Young Dean shivered, as much from relief as the cold. “You’re alright,” said Sam. “God, you had us worried.”
“I don’t mind. Anything,” said Dean. It was true that he was a young hunter, that there weren’t many things he alone could do. He was a grunt, some muscle at best, but anyone else close by could be that and better. “Tell him I’m bait. Something that’s picking off firstborns under twenty-one.”
Jack gave Dean a half-smile. “I’ll be there as soon as I can,” he said. He looked at Amara. “We’ve got work to do.”
“Like I couldn’t breathe,” said Dean. He didn’t look at the hills as the figures slowly disappeared, only knew their departure by the lessening pressure in his head. “Like everything in the world wanted me dead. Me included.”
“You are granting me my freedom,” said Eliza as Dean worked through the final lock. “I would help you with anything you asked.”
“You keep doing that,” Young Dean said, freeing his hand from Past-Cas’ and looking around himself. He gave an approving huff. “Nice spot,” he said. “You know, you guys could try this at the bunker. The windows, I mean.”
that if Dean thought about it for too long, if he thought beyond the corporeal vessel Cas inhabited, any reciprocated connection with him seemed an impossibility.
“Alright,” said Dean. “Well, I don’t think we can put life off much longer. Let’s open this door again.”
“I’m gonna do the same,” said Dean. “Come on.” He clapped a hand on Young Dean’s shoulder. “Let’s get you this brave new world.”
“Everyone’s fine,” said Dean. “The Thralls broke out of the spell the second you ended him. Eileen’s good. Cut wasn’t that bad, but Cas patched her up. Saved a few stitches.” Dean lowered himself to one knee beside Young Dean, searching his face. “Back inside,” he said. “Cas says you were asking about a Grail.”
“I made it back,” said Cas, defiant and cranky. “Rich of you to act like you wouldn’t do the same thing in my place.”
Cas heaved a sigh and went to the vehicle. He neatly ripped the tags off a new pair of winter gloves that Dean had bought in town that day and put them on. He adjusted the lay of the leather at his wrists and said, with a fondly scathing tone, “Satisfied?”
“We did it,” Dean said, a smile lighting up his face. Implausible, absolutely unreal, yet a part of him always knew that it just
“I’m aware you are a legal adult by contemporary American definitions,” said Castiel. “As a matter of fact, that was a pivotal point in our discussions. But to come of age means different things in different cultures. Sometimes it’s a number on a legal form, sometimes it’s after a religious rite. For some it’s puberty, or loss of virginity—”
Dean came back into earshot, bidding a brusque goodbye over the phone, then ending the call. “Claire finally reached Jody on her cell,” he said. “So I called her up and she says she’s out in Carmel with no idea how she got there. Staying with some hunter who found her knocked-out in Yosemite. Kooky little place warded to the gills against demons, angels, spirits, anything you could name.”
“I don’t think that’s the same to him,” said Young Dean. Neither of them said anything further, and Dean was about to leave. Young Dean spoke up again. “I approve of him. For the record. If that matters to you at all.”
“I don’t tell you to clean up your act,” said Cas. He sounded uncertain rather than defensive. Looked it too, gaze searching into Dean. As if he wondered whether he’d done the right thing, the thing Dean wanted, in having neglected this.
“Not alone,” said Zachariah. “An old garrison-pal of yours couldn’t wait to join me. He’s picky about his vessels, but he’ll be here any minute.”
“Cas, hey,” said Sam. “Hold up. Your clothes are soaked from being caught in the avalanche. That can’t be comfortable.”
He didn’t leave alone. He told as many humans as he could find of how to get out, how to return to the place they came from. He left the last of his instructions sealed in a bottle, half-buried at the base of a tree for any who came after, then he took his own road home.
But Heaven wasn’t anything like Westworld. None of the stakes, none of the drama. Westworld came with shoot-outs and bank robberies and bad guys. Heaven, by definition, wasn’t intended for bad guys. Dean could dress himself up in what attire he chose, sure, but what he liked about Westerns wasn’t only the clothes, but complicated men fighting for survival, for honour, for love. There wasn’t anything to fight for in Heaven. Nothing to fight against. Except maybe Heaven itself.
.” He was lucky Cas never unleashed the full power of his charm before Dean was prepared to understand it.
“Right,” said Dean. “But y’know, there’s three of you…” He was thinking too much of his Spaghetti Westerns again. It probably wasn’t the time for it. And yet... “But two of you want the same thing— We do want the same thing, right? Even though he’s your brother?”
Past-Cas tightened his hand around the angel blade, waiting for an opening to strike. “I don’t need a second chance,” he said. “Or to be talked to about blasphemy by a scheming traitor like you.”
, as if he wouldn’t stop of his own volition, as if Dean held the same intrigue as a puzzle or a work of art.
her bed—which Dean suspected meant she couldn’t be all bad and evidently knew a thing or two about self-protection. She didn’t fire. She now
“You know, this place you went,” Dean said, hesitating over his words. “I get it. There was a place I got pulled into, Purgatory, that was just constant fighting for your life against monsters. And in Hell, you know, time passed different there, too.”
Cas studied Dean instead of the waterfall. Dean leaned against the side of the bridge, forearm resting flat across the railing. His fingertips were just an inch from Cas’. He slowly curled them in only to resist reaching out to touch. He didn’t expect that to hit his heart like a severance.
“We should hide you from angel sight,” said Cas. “I don’t think anyone here wants them to find us out. They aren’t what you’d call sympathetic.”
“You can change your mind once you’re there,” said Cas, already reaching forward, two fingers extended towards Dean’s temple. “It’s always up to you. But don’t tell Dean I said that.”
“I don’t have much,” said Dean. “I could tell you who the President is in 2020—you’re not going to like it—but you got no way of fact-checking me on it till it happens.”
“You show up in Clint Eastwood’s poncho and I got the right to open fire.” John cracked the line with a laugh, turning away to pull out a couple of beers from the fridge. Fifteen years ago, it would’ve been enough for Dean to lose the thing on purpose, leave it behind in a motel room and tell himself he hadn’t cared for it anyhow. In the inconsequential nonchalance of death, Dean didn’t say anything. Because if he did it would turn nasty, and John would have to be right in the end, and then Dean wouldn’t want the bandana anymore. You got further with John if you didn’t defend yourself.
drink blood or grow talons get strange during the Santa Ana. Every hunter roundabout these parts is arming up with silver, salt, and holy water. Mark my words, there will be trouble tonight.”
Young Dean’s face altered with wonder, finally understanding what Past-Cas spent this whole time trying to say. “Is that what you long for, Cas?”
by now. Some kind of hint. Any. But he hasn’t, and he won’t, because he doesn’t. End of story. Run credits. Go home.”
“We don’t even know if Lawry will survive this,” Dean said. “Hosting an angel ain’t easy, even if the bloodline’s right.”
“No, no, you do not go there,” said Dean. He heaved a sigh, leaning over the table and rubbing his forehead. Young Dean was just so damn persistent. He would never let this go. “Look, there’s not a lot to say,” said Dean.
The idea that he wouldn’t want to leave, that something outside himself would interfere with his will to be back with Dad and Sam, had been repellent to Dean. It was another reason he stopped asking Pastor Jim so many questions.
Young Dean checked over a couple guns, ready to pop off rogue Arimaspians if it came to that kind of fight. Cas leaned against the car next to him, watching the entrance.
“Cas?” said Dean. He crossed to him in a couple of long steps, his eyes never leaving Cas’ face, and reached out a hand to his arm. “Cas, what’s happening? You okay?”
Cas made it back from Heaven late the next morning. Angels, he already knew, weren’t the kind to respond with enthusiasm to the concept of free will. He’d covered some ground, mostly through the gravity of his future knowledge, hopefully enough to hold off an Apocalypse. With all Heaven’s bureaucracy and corporate climbing, though, it would never truly be over. Once back at the apartment, Cas conferred with Past-Cas, standing by the window and strategizing with each other about Heaven. Meanwhile, the Deans returned to the corner of the room where the portal had been made. Young Dean took out the jar containing the last of his so-called ‘pot-pourri,’ angling it to the side to examine it.
“It is fitting,” said Past-Cas. In a natural movement lacking his usual angelic restraint, his fingers threaded through Young Dean’s hair. “Neither would I.”
“Probably right,” said Dean. He wrapped his hands around the cup. He hadn’t realised they were cold. He hadn’t realised how bare and vulnerable he felt right now. Everything was suddenly close to the surface.
“I’m glad you two are getting along,” said Cas. That trace of a smile appeared at the corner of his mouth. “You have a lot in common.”
“We also visited a bookstore,” Cas said, eyes flicking to Dean as he closed the trunk of the Impala. “He finds the car confining and strange, which it is. I told him he’d one day find the creative endeavours of humans quite inspiring.
Young Dean kept his chin high, his gaze level, but a troubled look took over his features. He knew himself too well, and knew how much pain existed beneath those strained words and tightly guarded expressions. He knew that the effort Dean put into hiding that pain only spoke to its sheer gravity. “That’s what’s happened here, isn’t it?” Young Dean asked at last. “A family. With Claire and Jack and Jody and Eileen. And
“Dean,” said Cas. He came closer, crouching in front of him. “We could go somewhere else.” He reached a hand towards Dean’s shoulder.
“I mean, Dad, that while you were gone, I saw things you can’t even imagine. I changed the world.” He took in a breath. This was the moment. He could play his cards cautiously, keeping John on his side, denying his sexuality in order to have John’s help going forward. Or he could light this bridge up and get out before his lungs choked up with smoke.
“I have another question,” said Dean. “Am I changing the future by talking to you? By remembering the things I wasn’t supposed to?”
“What about Sam, how’s he doing? I guess that’s what I really called to ask about. How things are with you guys, and whether the whole plan worked.”
Dean rolled his lower lip beneath his tongue, tasting the blood on it. He consciously relaxed his hands on the wheel before Sam noticed his whitening knuckles. “Pretty messed up, isn’t it?” he said.
“Touchy touchy,” Reid murmured again. He sighed and moved to take off the knit satchel he wore across his body. He pulled out a bronze bowl as well as a few additional jars and sachets. He took out a black candle engraved with sigils as well and set it in the middle of the table, giving his cheap gas-station lighter a few flicks to fire up.
“Is it related to this evil thing in the woods?” Dean asked, following as Eli turned to lead the way.
“If I could pass you over to him without losing my hold, I would,” said Amara. “He wants me to tell you he won’t fail you, Dean.”
“We weren’t supposed to meet yet,” said Cas, and he looked up at Dean beside him. He looked more than concerned. Wary, scared. Afraid, perhaps, of all that this might alter when something had only just begun. He looked back down at the phone. “Dean, you’re playing with fire.”
“I just keep pulling up dead ends,” said Sam. “I don’t know that there’s enough of his kind out there for people to have any real pointers on icing him.”
Sam’s face went drawn, glancing over to his charging phone. “She’s answering texts again,” he said. “She says she’s fine. Told me in no uncertain terms to keep my nose out of it.”
The words were working. Peter’s posture slackened. Minutely at first, then the barrel of the gun pointed towards the ground.
have something to send you off. But you’ve gotta take a minute, pull yourself together, and tell me what’s going on.”
He dreamt of a saloon-meets-sports bar, hazily sitting at a table littered with beer bottles and whiskey glasses. Across from him a man laughed, the corners of his eyes crinkled. Dean couldn’t fully see his face, but he thought
Young Dean looked as if he’d been dunked in cold water. He couldn’t look directly at Past-Cas. “Uh. Yep.”
“You know I’m right,” said Young Dean. “It’s what you said from the start. If I kill the world because I overstay my welcome in the future, well, that would cut the party short anyways.”
“I don’t think you need to worry about that, with Teen-Dean around.” Cas looked at ease, content with this soft back-and-forth. “I like your freckles. You’re handsome. I think I’m allowed to say that now.”
“So, what is this situation?” Eileen asked, signing and pointing to Young Dean. In all the business of settling, they never considered the fact that Young Dean’s presence was completely unprecedented to Eileen. An uncanny double of Dean with a wildly diverging history and the result of numerous time-travelling adventures, but they’d become sort of used to him.
His cowboy boots slid easily into the stirrups and he rode Baby for miles, idly searching for the edge of Heaven. Searching for the place Cas might be hidden. The problem was that Heaven could stretch out forever, offering him vistas of purple canyons and desert mountains and more, but if he decided he was ready to go home, the path back would take him to his door in all of five minutes. The landscape didn’t mean anything here.
“I mean, he didn’t take it easy on the beers either, when he got here,” said Sam. “Including, I noticed, a bona fide shower beer. But that’s also something you did all the time in your twenties.”
how Southern hospitality works.” She held up her next finger. “Two, I want to take a peek beneath the hood of that car before anyone leaves, and the polite thing to do is to at least get you a drink first.”
“That’s my line,” said Crowley. “Dean,” he greeted with a nod, his cunning eyes moving over the group. “And Dean.” A more appraising study before moving on. “And you must be Castiel.” Like the angels, he could see past Castiel’s human form to the true face underneath. He didn’t step out from behind Sam and Holden, but he donned a lordly smile. “What an honour.”
“I’m not, but that’s okay,” said Dean. He didn’t know why he kept saying it was alright. Perhaps it was only that he knew it had been hopeless from the beginning. He had no desire to distress Cas or make him feel poorly. It wasn’t Castiel’s fault he didn’t know any better. “You’re saying there’s no way to take me there? Just to let Cas know I know? Future you, I mean.”
“That was you, Dean,” said Sam. “Need I remind you. Not some other person, or alternate-reality-Dean. Straight up, you.”
“Yeah,” said Dean, nose wrinkling and mouth twisting in a moue of displeasure. “Yeah, you can likely guess.”
“We’ll try the strawberries later,” Dean told Cas. “We’re just grabbing some beers. Teen-Dean’s got a lead on that sword, thinks we might be able to help Eileen. You want a beer?”
“We gave you a reputable job,” said Zachariah. “The chance to reform. It was more than some thought we should offer such a badly broken angel. One on a dangerous path towards blasphemy.”
“I guess,” Dean said quietly. “I guess there are some things I haven’t been so sorry to leave behind.”
He settled in at one of the seats along the counter to wait for the food, most of his attention absorbed by a display case full of pie. He wondered how much he could get away with ordering. Cas, Sam, and Dean weren’t going to let him overstay his welcome here. Once they had the griffin egg, they’d send Young Dean back to his own time, where a square meal didn’t come so easy. He drummed his fingers against the counter as he thought over the relative risks and benefits of eating his weight in pie immediately before fighting a deadly mythical creature.
“Don’t think I didn’t clock you on that go-to witch who’s Queen of Hell,” said Essie. “Don’t ask me about Reid Jenkins and I won’t call you a hypocrite.”
The six of them researched, though it was different, with having Past-Cas around. Anytime there was the suggestion of a lead, a place to check out, he zapped there with Dean to investigate. Most were cold trails, but at one spot they came across a dead Arimaspian and traces of sulphur, and another location showed signs of being rapidly abandoned. It didn’t bring them closer to Sam, but as Jody helpfully pointed out, the fact that they hadn’t found a trace of him pointed increasingly towards him being alive and unharmed. Whether he was out-strategizing his enemies or being held captive, though, they had no way of knowing yet.
“I have a good one,” said the second hag, raising a finger in the air. Her shoulders canted with a sealike sway, as if the liquor had begun to take hold. The other sisters cackled again. Oh god, they were all drunk, and Young Dean’s head was swimming too. His tolerance was nothing against the high proof of the hooch.
“Well I’m not trading you,” said Young Dean. “Hey, I’ll meet you guys at a motel. I’m not being sneaky. I didn’t want to lay all my shit on you.”
“I was kinda worked up,” said Dean. “I fell in love with Cas from this time. I brought him with me when I made this new world. We were supposed to be in this together.”
naughty boy, Dean Winchester,” Zachariah said. “You know things you shouldn’t know. It isn’t time for angels to walk the Earth, yet.” He paced closer. “This will be over quickly,” he said, raising a hand. “You’ll forget we were ever here.”
Though why the hell should anyone think a Winchester would go to college? It was almost a laugh that Dean’s mind even summoned it up, except for the part where it wasn’t a very good joke.
“Where he’s supposed to be meeting the Arimaspoi is pretty remote. He warned us he might run out of signal.”
“Oh? And what doctor told you that?” She looked back to the men. “She won’t even go to the hospital and get it looked at.”
“I already explained,” said Castiel, shaking his head. “The card deck. The order of the universe. I can’t travel into the future.”
“Dean, I know,” said Sam. “I believe you. What I thought at the start— I didn’t know then what I know now.”
After giving sufficient blood to the bowl, she took up a cloth to catch the trail down her arm, trying to staunch the cut.
That didn’t mean he wasn’t part of artifice of it all. Part of the torture. A final turn of the screw.
Tonight wouldn’t give them that, though. Tonight Past-Cas was unconscious and under a dangerous spell, a witch with a questionable storeroom was driving his way up the coast, and Sam was still missing. Still, it didn’t stop Dean from catching Cas when they stood, closing him in against the island, and necking like teenagers.
“You guys never should’ve been in the middle of it,” said Dean. “We knew something might come up, but we thought we were keeping you out of the sightlines. We figured he’d only show up wherever Teen-Dean was.”
“It should have been very insignificant. The place I guard is not beautiful. There are many superficial faults in the walls and foundation. I do not believe they want the prisoner to see what is beautiful.”
“Right,” said Sam. “You get him out there, Cas. Teen-Dean?” Sam got up, carefully moving around the broken angle of the griffin’s wing. “You alright? Let’s grab that egg.”
Sam laughed, pushing hair behind his ear and obliviously streaking blue paint through it. “The jackass I’m looking at, I guess,” he said. Young Dean laughed and went back to his work, while Sam still surveyed the mandala.
“Sammy!” Young Dean called out, spreading his arms wide. “Hey, Dean,” he said, eyes lighting up. “I never been to a bar with Sammy before.”
Dean kicked back his Thrall, and Young Dean used the split moment in time to cut Dean’s hands free. “Go to Eileen,” Dean ordered, but Young Dean was already on it.
Young Dean stepped forward slowly from his place by the bookshelves. “It can create another world without destroying this one?”
It was only five or six pages, but the text was dense and printed in an archaic-looking Gothic script. There were so many references beyond Young Dean’s familiarity, and by the end he felt like his vision was swimming. But reading it for himself was different than hearing about it second-hand, and he now had a few clearer images in his head of what to expect. He wasn’t done with research, but he slumped back against the seat to give his brain a brief break.
Cas had been gone for almost ten months, and there was still barely a day that went by without Dean thinking of him.
“I don’t know,” said Scott. “I called for help. And I begged him. I begged him not to kill me. And he said we could make an exchange.”
“I didn’t think we had a choice,” Dean said. “I didn’t like it, after the first time you came here. I knew I was sending you back to some real shitty circumstances, but our hands were tied. My life could only happen one way. I had to make all the choices I made, just like I always made them. But I couldn’t shake the feeling it was somehow unfair to you.”
“Did he say anything?” Dean asked. He didn’t grip Elijah’s arms like he wanted to. Didn’t shake him and beg for every detail. “Did he do anything?”
“We were scrappy,” said Dean, almost fond, getting his knee out of Young Dean’s back and standing straight again. He stepped back a few paces as Young Dean scrambled to his feet. He got right back into his boxing stance, back heel raised from the ground, as ready to dodge as attack.
Young Dean stepped down towards the three sea hags, who had risen to squat on their haunches, watching him curiously. The others shadowed after him, a few steps behind, circled around the other side of the luminous summoning sigil. Dean kept a hand on his gun, although he didn’t draw it.
Dean gave a thoughtful nod. When they went griffin-hunting, when they knew they could run into some demons on the mountain, Dean had drawn a symbol onto Young Dean’s arm to keep him from being possessed. “We’ll get you set up while we’re here,” said Dean after a moment. “Still. Seems a little paranoid.”
They were in hearing now, and Holden turned on the heel of a boot. “You asking about Ronnie?” he said, the smile on his face growing wider than it had been yet.
Young Dean he seemed to trust more than anyone, relaxing a shade. His fingers squeezed once against Young Dean’s hand, but didn’t let go.
“Like… Like hunters,” said Scott. He didn’t say the word like deer hunter, duck hunter. He said the word like it was half-new to him, like he’d only ever read it before. A mix of boldness and uncertainty.
“It’s okay, Cas,” said Sam through a mouthful of popcorn. “I don’t even think Dean knows what he means.”
“They’re helping us,” said Dean. “Besides, we got no idea how to gank them, and at this point? I don’t want to get them mad.”
Most tables in the small joint were full. In the back two, a bunch of old farmers who’d never tip gossiped in half-intelligible mumbles, a clear fixture of the place in the way they swapped out seats in a well-worn routine. The waitress put off the heavy-handed flirtation of a couple construction labourers picking up the coffee order for a crew. Near the window, an overwrought mother tried to manage her two restless kids and the baby while asking her hard-jawed mother-in-law for a private loan, just to make it to the end of the year. It could’ve been any diner in America. This anonymity gave it a whiff of safety. Dean would take what scraps he could get.
Dean wanted to give Cas a better answer than the simple one. Cas deserved better than that. He said, “I’m trying not to.”
“Don’t you understand what I’m saying? I have already seen your light, Dean Winchester. It’s too late for me to do anything but love you.”
“You were part of a wider plan,” said Castiel, carefully watching Young Dean. “It’s a complicated story. It was just about the last time I followed one of Heaven’s orders.”
“He was supposed to be a prophet,” said Dean. “Which you don’t have here, which is just as well. But you’ll see for yourself. Friends, enemies. Zachariah is in there, so’s Crowley.”
And so they descended on the kitchen again, making food and exchanging banter, theories about Abrasax rising up despite their supposed commitment not to think about research. When the doorbell rang, Dean went to answer it. Young Dean and Cas, both temporarily free of a kitchen task, followed as Dean opened the door to Claire.
She pulled out the subject drawer under ‘G’, flipping through the cards expertly. “Griffins are Greek, I believe?” she said. “You might look under ‘chimera’ as well, or even ‘manticore.’ Here’s one that might do…” She stopped at one of the index cards, then took a scrap of paper from the top of the catalogue and jotted down a call number and the brief title of a book in very tidy writing. She followed this with some additional numbers set to neat bullet points. “Greek fiction and epics are under 883, but look around that section. Some of it might be under Greek Mythology in the 290s, too.”
“That’s not true,” said Young Dean. “You can’t listen to him, Jody. The old man gets forgetful sometimes.”
“But the… the ‘calibration’ of the universe,” said Young Dean, voice low and quiet. “Everything that happened to you, to us, it’s all part of the timeline. Even the terrible parts.” He didn’t sound much like he believed himself.
“Dean, I know you’re kind of all-or-nothing with relationships, but you don’t have to do this as a speed-run. I mean, I don’t think Cas is going anywhere.”
The day after Zachariah’s final message, Dean tracked down Lawry Novak’s phone number. He tried a dozen different “L. Novak” numbers across different states before the last one, a distant cousin named Laura, supplied Dean with the correct number saying it happened all the time.
“They want the Arimaspoi removed,” said Young Dean. “They’ve encroached on their land. It says we cannot trust the Arimaspoi.”
“Just say you’ll give me a call one day when you need the help,” said Essie. “That’s all I’m asking.”
There were others he wished he had the chance to tell. His mother. Bobby and Charlie—the originals, the ones he knew the first time around and had a past with. They topped the list of dead friends and family, the list that never stopped growing. Maybe in Young Dean’s world, some of them would be spared. Or maybe there was just more loss ahead. What didn’t Young Dean want to talk about?
“I hope his visit to your unconscious didn’t attract notice,” said Cas. “If he’s wise, he’ll have kept his mouth shut.”
“Rachel, I’m Dean,” he said. “Look, you got a long way to go before you might be able to strike out on your own. I don’t know how to make an Asshole Dad any
“I’m very old and harder to kill,” said Cas. “But the choices I’ve made? I justify them as rational at the time, but they often arise out of panic or desperation or misguided judgment. All that to say we’re evenly matched in terms of recklessness.”
Young Dean reached for his hand, stopping him. “Please don’t take me too seriously, Cas,” he said. “I’m not always good at saying what I mean.”
, Sam said to him once. But it wasn’t until he met Dean. It wasn’t until he raised him from Hell. This Cas wasn’t a rule-breaker. Dean looked down at the dirt between their feet. He stood close, but Cas didn’t seem to mind. Maybe didn’t know better, where personal space was concerned. Or maybe didn’t care, acting out of the persistent, humming draw Dean felt towards him.
Dean tossed away another fallen branch. “You really thought this through? I mean, you sure about this?”
Waylon sighed and leaned to look in the kitchen door. The clock said he still had ten minutes of his break left. He looked between Jack and Dean once more. His eyes flicked over Jack, then away.
“King,” Scott corrected. “The Oak Tree King. He ordered me to come with him. Cornered me back against a tree. Said he’d make me a prince. His son. Said he’d kill me if I didn’t go willingly.”
Young Dean’s hands were free of their loose bonds from the moment he bent down. He got his knife in hand, pulled the Thrall off of Cas, nearest him, and quickly cut his bonds.
They left the restaurant behind, but Young Dean noticed the thoughtful look Cas directed back toward it. He heaved a sigh. He felt like an idiot for being so corny and soft with the girl back there, but he knew where she was coming from. He knew how many times just one stranger being nice to him would’ve made all the difference. “Whatever it is you want to say,” he said. “Just go ahead and get it over with.”
“I haven’t seen them,” said Cas. “I stand guard at the door. They must have done something very terrible. In the years I’ve served this duty, no one has come to visit them.”
“I told him it had to be yours,” said Sam. “I mean, it was a Jesse James tin case. He said he gave you enough money over the years you wouldn’t begrudge him.”
Young Dean laughed, teeth still bared. “You think I can’t see your little crush on Cas? The one you’re too much of a pussy to do anything about?”
Jack had that look in his eye like he wanted to change that, like he wanted to pull Eli from the Veil and give him a second chance at life. If he still had his powers, he might’ve been able to do it, to break his own code, but now it wasn’t even an option.
“Jimmy believed it was a car accident, but if I—” Cas paced away, rubbing at his temple. “If I destroyed the
Young Dean hadn’t forgotten his brief meeting with Claire. This time she wore a leather jacket and heavier makeup. She still carried herself like she had the world’s biggest chip on her shoulder, but Young Dean saw the way a smile softened her face as she hugged Dean, then Cas.
Maybe it was the drive or maybe it was the curious nostalgia of the past gripping him, but Dean had the sense of time stopping altogether. Present and past converged here. Time didn’t hold him accountable. He existed outside the parameters of fate and consequence, free of narrative, free of destiny. He hadn’t had this kind of liberty in ages.
Part of the problem was that motels didn’t leave you with many options for storing food. Frozen meals or fresh dairy were rarely an option. Saving a few cents by buying something in bulk was out of the offering too. Not to mention dishes, cookware, and the fact there was almost never more than a microwave or a hotplate for cooking on.
“You’ve always had more of a knack for this kid stuff,” said Dean, shaking his head. “Like with Jack. You always know the right things to say.”
“What does?” Castiel asked, glancing out the front window, looking to the right of where the Watcher stood. “Is it
“It’s true that I have no way of recalling what I don’t remember,” he said. “But I can say with some confidence that I have only overthrown their attempts at brainwashing once. That strikes me as being rather… indicative.”
No answer. Cas shifted next to him, turning onto his side. His nose pressed against Dean’s shoulder and an arm crossed over Dean’s chest. The familiar weight of Cas’ body, normally welcome, seemed doubled in the midnight heat. Sweat trapped on skin at every point their bodies touched and no escape.
“No, it…” Dean had never had a ghost ask him this question. “It would dematerialize you for a bit. Not long.”
“I know it will work,” said Bobby. Dean caught the implicit condemnation. He couldn’t dwell on that, though. John and Bobby could be at odds about the strangest things, and Bobby just didn’t understand that sometimes Dean was best put to use drawing fire. He was an idealist in that regard, where John was a realist. Dean couldn’t give it too much credence.
“Doesn’t seem fair that you don’t know who you’re guarding or what they did. What if they never did anything wrong at all?”
Dean still didn’t quite look at Sam, but a mild smile took to his face, alongside a hint of a familiar, playful light in his eyes. “I don’t think there’s any world where I’d call this ‘settling.’”
Dean carefully readjusted his grip on the steering wheel, letting out a breath. A passing car’s headlights lit up his face again, casting his features into sharp definition, making the blood look black on his skin.
“What he said,” said Dean, leaving off with a grin because Cas looked sufficiently tormented. He paced by the Mazda, gaze sweeping over it once more. “Where’s Holden, anyway?”

“Teen-Dean was asking for us,” said Past-Cas. His blue eyes were perfectly steady and dispassionate as he looked between them, coloured, perhaps, with a shade of innocence. Dean remembered that look. As if he were checking to see if he’d done the right thing, because humans could be confusing, and their actions counterintuitive. Sometimes what they wanted wasn’t what they asked for and vice-versa. Angel logic was simpler than that.
Dean’s hip bumped against a chair, the sharp scrape of its legs against the floor startling him more than it should’ve. He corrected it with both hands, taking another step back. The sound drew him out of his head enough to make him aware of his racing heart.
“Thought it was something to get Cas back?” said Dean. It took some conjecture, he didn’t know the how or why, but Young Dean’s motives weren’t exactly hard to pick apart.
Dean pulled up a reference picture of Young Dean and Past-Cas on his phone, a candid photo sent to him by Claire when they’d turned up in her bedroom.
“He made a promise.” Cas’ voice came even lower than usual, tired and heavy. Nearly a subsonic rumble. Dean smiled. He liked that rumble.
Cas’ eyes glanced tellingly in the direction of the kitchen once more, where Dean was. Dean, who had gone even longer.
“Where’d you find this old thing anyway?” Dean asked Young Dean, taking the ID from Roger and flashing a look at the outdated card, forcing a jocular tone. “Kids, am I right?” he said, trying to get Roger back on his side.
Cas crossed to his side. Young Dean shared one final look with his older self, giving a nod of his head. Cas touched his temple and they disappeared.
Otherwise, he was just as Young Dean remembered. Each dark eyelash delicately fanned against Cas’ high cheekbones. The twin peaks of his pink mouth and the almost pouty downturn at its corners. He reached a hand up, wanting to trace his fingers through the wave of his dark hair, but he pulled back. Aware of being watched or afraid that he would find the touch of cold clay instead of the softness he remembered.
“I know I wasn’t exactly easy on you when I got here,” said Young Dean, like he was the one obliged to make amends. “I might’ve said some things I shouldn’t have said. I might’ve made you think I didn’t like you.”
Young Dean looked at Dean for confirmation of this. Dean answered with the barest shrug of one shoulder. Matched with the sincere look in his eyes, though, it said
The next day they made real progress. Dean called Sam once to check in on him, making sure everything was okay and John wasn’t making motions about moving. Apparently he was deep into research about an annual haunting near Tuscaloosa that would come due within the month, and that would keep him busy. That was good. It eased some of Dean’s guilt about leaving Sam alone with their dad.
“Yeah yeah,” said Dean. “Didn’t count on the angel brigade to come in and fuck with that.” He looked between Young Dean and Sam. “Won’t make the same mistake this time. There’s a lot at risk. But you swear to me, cross your heart, that none of this has anything to do with demons?”
“You gave him sixty-eight dollars,” said Dean. “And he put it in his pocket.” He placed a hand over his chest, the same shirt-pocket that Young Dean used. “And he gets back to Schaffer’s bar that night and he doesn’t know any time passed at all, but he’s got sixty-eight dollars he didn’t have before and doesn’t even know where it came from. And it was you.”
(who I heartily recommend if you like being charmed and occasionally upset about general relativity or How Time Happens), and "There is no time, there is only change: in fact, change is everything we measure!" must be imagined in the cheerful voice of Francesca Vidotto, as presented at that one spacetime conference I attended
Sam didn’t say anything at first, although Dean’s mangled attempt at communication could be to blame for that. Sam looked like he was trying to solve a complex algebra problem. “So he… You’re… gay?” He said it in an undertone, the word barely familiar on his mouth, but given their setting Dean could appreciate the whisper.
Cas stroked his thumb against Dean’s jaw. Their foreheads touched, noses brushed, then Cas kissed him. The pressure in his chest didn’t go away. His ribs still felt compressed, his lungs and heart tight, but some of the dreck in his head cleared. Cas’ kiss was warm and pacifying, assurance and forgiveness.
“Better,” said Dean. He turned back to Sam, now shouldering the backpack. “Ready? Or are we gonna stand around here all night?”
He said he wouldn’t do it. He said it wouldn’t matter. At the end of that very same day, though, after stealing fresh plates for the car, after spending the last of his money on gas, lying awake in the front seat of the station wagon, Dean found himself praying. Cas never answered. But in the days that came, Dean did it again and again. Telling Cas all that happened to him. Asking for his help. Asking for his forgiveness for what he had to do. Because he couldn’t make Sam sleep the night in a cold car again.
Dean’s hand went to the gear shift, his foot lifting from the brake. Then he looked out the front window and stopped.
“Look, it’s a long story,” said Young Dean. “And I’m not saying it’ll be easy to get. But I got a pretty promising lead. Hey, can we do this over a beer? Interdimensional travel is thirsty work.”
“When you’re not on this Earth, I don’t see why I’d stay,” said Cas. “You’re the reason I’m here. And the only thing that would make me return to Heaven is you.”
“I’m not certain.” Cas leaned against the counter, looking curiously at his own Dean. “It’s not something I’ve heard of before, but then, we’ve always been good at inventing new ways to break the laws of Heaven and Hell. Beyond that, all I can say is the ways that knowing Dean has transformed me are countless.”
“Everything else in his life’s a mess,” said Dean. “I can read between the lines with him. It hasn’t been good living all the way.”
“At this point? Pretty much everything,” said Sam. “We were careful at first, not wanting to give away too much, but he’s scary smart. And, like, so cool.”
Cas sat at the kitchen island, and Dean sat kitty-corner to him. Their knees brushed by accident and Dean pulled back out of habit. Then, purposefully, let it happen again.
Finally, he said, “There’s one thing… One thing I want to be like him in. See, I fell off the mountain and they thought I might be dead, but when they found me again… Dean, he…” Young Dean rubbed his jaw, where Dean’s hand had clasped. “He reached out like I was a brother or a son and he looked dead at me and I knew he really cared. Not just for his own sake, but because it mattered to him that I was okay. And the way I felt like I belonged right then… I want to be able to make someone else feel like that. I want to remember the difference it made. To be able to do something so simple that can mean the world to someone.”
“Guess I did,” said Dean. He spotted the half-empty bottle of Wild Turkey on the table and thought of his empty money tin. He couldn’t bring that up. He had to choose his battles today.
“I wish you’d been here before,” said Eli. “I wish the man in the trench coat could have saved me like he did Waylon.”
Dean tipped his head to look at Cas again. Cas lay there with his brow furrowed, his jaw set, and Dean’s tense body slackened. “Then don’t argue with me,” he said, simple and low. “Just believe me. You’ve always been important.”
“And whether it’s both guys and girls in general or whether it’s just… just Cas, that’s all… I just want you to be happy, Dean.”
“I didn’t know I was feeling all that,” Young Dean said. “I didn’t know you could, too. I would’ve stopped if I knew.”
“I’m not hitting you back,” said Dean, clapping a hand on Young Dean’s shoulder and setting him on their path back down the trail. “It was an accident.”
Cas opened his wallet. He took out all the cash that was in there, placing it on the table and shoving it across to Dean. Sure, Dean didn’t have his math credit yet, but he’d been broke enough before that he could tally the bills without even consciously looking at the numbers. Sixty-eight dollars.
It was a Thursday night and the place was fairly quiet, with only a few customers settled in at different tables. Dean and Young Dean approached the bar. The owner, a tall and broad man who had no hair on his head but quite an impressive moustache, straightened up from where he’d been leaning against the bar top, watching the game on TV.
“I’m not holding your hand,” said Zachariah, predictably unappreciative of Uriel’s humour. “But I will…” He placed his own hand palm out, power spewing forth. The shadow of Castiel’s wings spread wide, protecting those behind him from the force of Zachariah’s first attack.
He entered the kitchen in the middle of Cas attempting to explicate the differences in his experience of Kona and Molokai coffees.
“They put you up to this?” said Sam. “Do this one thing, and walk free from your contract? They’re using you, Peter.”
Eli turned his head away. “I don’t remember dying,” he said. “I remember running. Running away from something. I tried to get out of the woods. It was dark. Something was hunting me. I remember thinking if the sun just came up, I’d be saved. I thought of everything in my life up until I came into the woods and how much I wanted to go back and wished I’d never come. And then the sun did come up. But it didn’t save me. It was the last thing I saw. After that, I don’t know how long after, I remember realising I was dead and would never go home. But I don’t remember how I died.”
This. This must be what Dean had tried to say. That angels don’t feel at all, therefore a romance with Cas is an impossibility. The thought that Dean might have been right about something was endlessly frustrating to Young Dean.
Young Dean shrugged. “I didn’t know what we’d find here,” he said. “If it would be Evelyn. If it would be empty.” His gaze skipped back to Wallis, taking in Lanie for a moment too. “We’re not going to hurt anybody,” he said. “They’ve worked with witches, I’ve worked with witches, Essie’s worked with witches. I think it’s safe to say none of us has an absolute moral stance on magic.”
“I realise I probably should have asked you more questions before I let you drag me into Future Land,” said Dean.
Dean’s mouth twisted, considering it for a long moment. Taking in what he could see of the ocean, the trees, all gilded by brilliant rays of light. At this time of day the sun was still high, yet it shone onto the Western face of the land, slowly preparing to set over the ocean. It was a rare, golden kind of light that reshaped the world, made it stirring and mythical. Here especially, under the warm, dry winds, it left him with the nebulous feeling of a fever-dream.
“So even the thought,” Young Dean said, filling in the gaps he knew his mind would make. “Even the thought of being with him reminds you of that. That’s… that’s just awesome. Great. Real healthy. I’m so glad we managed to fuck up the one good thing that might happen to us, all because we… yeah.” He swallowed hard. “Yeah. Good.”
“He’d take you over me any day,” said Dean. “Not just now, because I’ve pissed him off, but always. I don’t say that to put you on the spot or anything. I just think maybe you don’t see it so clearly. I wanted him to think I was the perfect son. I wanted you to think it. But I always knew it was a charade.”
“Ah-ah-ah,” said Crowley. Unnoticed in the tumult, amongst the fallen bodies, he’d taken up a weapon of his own. He held a silver-tipped spear, angled just under Cas’ chin. “Not so fast. How about you put that blade down and we proceed as gentlemen, hm?”
“Teen-Dean doesn’t need to meet Jack, Cas,” said Dean. “He’d be a bad influence, anyway. Believe me.”
“Eh, I guess not,” Dean conceded. They both lifted their beers, taking a swig with the same, easy action.

They left the Impala at the back of the abandoned shop and car wash at the edge of the woods. On the faded yellow walls, the list of services was painted in a neat hand sidealong with biblical warnings. Grease Job, Oil Change, Motor Tune-Up; There Is Still Time - Repent Your Sins And Be Forgiven. Following a course behind the shop, a running trail branched off into the forest for a shady, half-mile loop. Dean and Jack left the trail after they crossed the footbridge over Skinner’s Creek, following the directions given by Amybeth and Brayden to seek out the site of the party.
Dean didn’t want to admit he was cold because Sam would take it as a sign he was dying. He’d been cold since they arrived in this godforsaken mountain town, and the negligible heating in this motel room didn’t do anything to help.
“This is,” said Cas, fully between them now, “an extraordinary argument that I’m sure could circle back on itself for decades, but I wouldn’t mind if we saved ourselves the time and carried on. Dean, you need coffee.” It was too early for him to deal with this sans caffeine. “You’ll feel better. Teen-Dean, I imagine that goes for you as well.” Cas gestured his head towards the kitchen, and Young Dean unfolded from his spot at the end of the bed. He passed the other two men to make for the kitchen, seemingly better for being out of Dean’s presence.
He was close. So close to a tipping point. Dean couldn’t push this further without fear of breaking it apart, but he had to trust in Cas’ natural curiosity. He had to believe that even without knowing their past, there was enough between them for Cas to risk disobedience.
In the background, Young Dean laughed, passing a hand over his face. Chiefly because he could relate.
“I didn’t have loads of examples of good homes,” said Dean. “Bobby’s was the only stable place I knew, growing up.”
“Well, that’s up to me, isn’t it?” said Young Dean. He didn’t want Cas passing judgement on him, or, worse, mentioning this to Sam or Dean. Dean especially. He needed to keep this contained.
“I just…” Cas shook his head. “For most of my existence I was just a cog in a machine,” he said. “Coming in to say a line, to start a scene or two. Nothing about me, beyond the demands of my role, ever mattered.” He drew in a careful breath, gaze tracing the dusty trail of stars above them. “The angel delivers a fateful prophecy. He smites a mortal threat moments before it prevails. He raises the hero from the ground. That’s who the story is about.” He turned his head to look at Dean again, face cast in a serious mien. “That’s whose birthday matters.”
. It’s not something I say a lot, but I mean it. I hate that you don’t like me because I’m kind of crazy about you, and
“Just say you disapprove,” said Young Dean. He looked out the window, squinting against the bright sunlight.
“Our problems got a lot bigger,” Dean said. “You don’t even know. We don’t just deal with some lousy vamp nests and a budding rugaru. We’ve stopped the apocalypse half a dozen times.”
Dean accepted the cold bottle of El Sol that John offered to him, John’s face creased with smiling because life had never been so easy.
The end of the thunder-roll presaged the start of the rain, heard bare moments before it was seen and felt. It flecked darkly onto the sandy flat stones of the walkway, pattered against the shingles of the covered porch. On the steps, they were only just out of its path, unmotivated to move.
“Tomorrow,” Cas continued, as if there had been no interruption, “I will request an audience with Heaven. See if I can’t persuade the rest of the angels to call off any and all wars and let this world be.”
Sam didn’t betray the same surprise, though he looked cautious as he approached. “What happened to you?” he asked. “I thought you said the case with Bobby was nothing.”
, he thought. He had no experience with prayer. He didn’t know if he was doing this right, if it would even work. He intertwined his fingers on his chest, closed his eyes.
“I’ll be there in a minute.” Scott ended the call. Dean exchanged a look with Jack, then got him a gun and a knife. He was just checking the clip of his own gun when a knock came on their door. Not even a minute.
“What do you long for?” said Young Dean. He tried to build walls around his own desire. He didn’t wish to unduly influence Past-Cas.
“Hold on, hold on,” said Dean, reaching for his coat pocket. “I’m getting a call.” He pulled out his phone. “It’s Claire.”
his brother leaning back in his chair to turn over a fresh thought. “If he’s anything like an oak, I mean made of wood, you could always try setting him on fire.”
“Cas is Sam’s friend too,” said Young Dean. “Actually, I kinda like it, you know? That they just get along like that. And they both have someone else they can go to when they want to be nerds about research.”
“Yes, Dean said you’d say that. If you decide to come, you’ll return to this bar, this night, before I walked in here.” Cas paused. “Sam— Sam’s in the future. The weapon we’re looking for, that we’re trading the griffin egg for, we’re doing it to help him.”
Scott nodded, as if that direction was what he needed at the moment. He gave the bulk of his attention to Jack. “It was the morning Eli died. It was December, when the sun doesn’t come up till late. I think that’s important, that it was just before dawn.” He rubbed at the bottom of his goatee again. “I stayed late at a friend’s and was trying to get back before morning, so my old man wouldn’t know I’d been out all night. I cut through the woods. It was darker in there than I thought it would be, but I figured I knew where I was going. Then I wandered right into this weird mist. I was set to get myself lost for sure, I couldn’t even make out what was right in front of me. Then I saw something come out of the trees. Like it actually separated itself from them, somehow. It was tall—had this crown on of thistles or antlers or something that made it taller—and a tail, I think. I see it in my nightmares.”
“Huh,” said Scott. His arms crossed over his chest as he spoke, looking over the pair of them. “Who said that?”
“Saw it,” said Scott. He dragged a hand from his brow down to his chin, fingers working around the hair of his dark goatee. “Talked to it.”
“What is that anyway?” Dean asked with a nod at the jar. “I’ve never seen sleep-mode on a portal before.”
“Chuck knows we’re planning something,” said Amara, hands sweeping over the sand to draw out a new sigil, one far more powerful than what Dean has first used. Separating the three of them was no simple lark.
There was a quiet, expectant moment as the dark figure, recognizably taking the shape of Cas, stepped through. He wore a mild expression: the tail-end of a smile from seeing Jack and little in the way of expectation as he crossed between worlds.
Dean accepted this warily, as if he might have a different assessment for himself, but he didn't argue it outright. He looked back over at Young Dean. “The boy isn’t all pure heroics,” he said, returning to the earlier topic. “Isn’t that right? You got anything to share with the class? About, say, a Grail?”
It was two in the morning when Reid Jenkins knocked on the door. Essie was up again, wearing comfy clothes under a patterned robe and a pair of glasses they hadn’t seen her in before. She opened the door to another blast of warm wind and a man in his thirties who smelled more strongly of weed than someone who had recently been driving probably should’ve.
“You’re really good at this,” Dean said. He briefly considered what it would be like to have a librarian as a hunter. He took them for meek and bookish, but they seemed to know
The Dark Watcher’s arm extended out, pointing inland. Dean nodded again. The figure receded, the motion of its departure like that of merging shadows, indistinct and difficult to place.
Bobby looked like he wanted to speak, shifting forward in his chair and opening his mouth to interrupt, but he remembered Dean’s request not to speak in time to stop himself.

“Maybe they should hear me,” said Young Dean, wound into a righteous fury. “It might get their fucking heads out of their asses.”
Dean had to remind himself expressly that this was not Castiel. He found his voice, though it came weak to start: “Hi. Is this Lawry Novak?”
Dean shot Sam a skeptical look, as if that wasn't the turn of phrase he’d use. No matter how objectively correct it was.
“What does he need?” Jody asked, stepping forward from the doorway, passing Essie who looked on with a furrowed brow. “Time to heal? A counter-spell?”
“Save it much longer and it will turn into a science project,” said Sam. “C’mon, Dean. I mean. Proto-Dean. Fuck, what should I call you?”
Stopped that thought before it went further. He eased the Impala away from the rumble strip on the side of the highway, back to the middle of his lane.
He might’ve been playing up the wide-eyed surprise. The time she took to taunt him was enough for him to pull out his gun, force it beneath her chin, and fire off a demon-trap bullet. The demon’s lips parted in a gasp, her mind alert but her body paralyzed. Dean pulled his machete out of her stomach and let her fall to the frozen ground.
“I don’t give a fuck about ‘useful,’” said Dean. The stone at his back pressed into his shoulders, his body taut and his movements abrupt and harsh. “You’re so much more than what you do when it’s the end of the world and we need help. You’re not just a quick fix for a problem. That’s not why I think about you every minute of the day.”
“I’m running out of grace,” said Cas. “You may have noticed I didn’t manage my best healing, today.” Eileen still had a pink scar on her arm from her earlier fight.
“But I could be so much better,” said Young Dean. “If I knew how to do it different. You’d change it if you could, don’t pretend you wouldn’t. And I
Dean traced his thumb and forefinger over the straight line of his nose. “You’ve got a decent life for yourself here, Dean,” he said. He looked away from the road, taking in his younger face in profile, unable to sort out whether he saw himself or someone entirely different. “I’m proud of you.”
Dean turned in one more circle, then collapsed the antenna of his EMF reader and turned it off. “Yeah,” he said. “Twenty-odd years would be enough to break most spirits. Maybe he doesn’t know he’s dead.”
“Dean.” The blue eyes looked oddly hard, cold. Dean didn’t want the guy to get mad. He didn’t think twenty was anything to the type of man who ironed his shirts, but only cheapskates came around to places like this, Dean supposed.
Eileen came back from her shower in one of Sam’s t-shirts and a pair of pyjama shorts found in the master bedroom’s drawers. She settled with a beer in her hand, damp hair over her shoulder, and her legs across Sam’s lap. Young Dean, Cas, and Dean sat on the room’s other couch.
“We are here by divine command,” Past-Cas said. He nodded at his counterpart. “Castiel received revelation that we were to come.” Turning more to Cas he added, “I enacted the blood spell as requested, though it brought us somewhat unexpectedly to Claire Novak.”
“I think maybe something’s gotten into you while I’ve been gone,” said John. His face altered so minutely that it was hard to pinpoint what changed, but every feature made this slight shift to form a mask of disgust. “Maybe even literally.”
“Cas,” said Dean. “Stand down. Put the angel blade away.” He couldn’t watch Cas be struck by that spear again.
“Pay off the bill before Dad gets back, he’ll be none the wiser. There’s…” Dean hesitated. He didn’t want to raise questions. He didn’t want Sam to touch dirty money. But if John was in a mood, like Sam said, then they couldn’t risk waiting around for Dean to arrive.
you. But hell, I’m embarrassed about it now. This is what I have to turn into? Some angry loser who won’t admit he—”
“But think about it, with the griffin and everything,” said Sam. “It was two animals in one form, that’s where the egg’s power comes from. And like, look at this part.” He pointed at ‘eros’ at the top of the mandala. “According to Jung, Eros’ form is flame. It devours. Opposite is the Tree of Life.” He pointed at the word ‘vita’ at the bottom, where Past-Cas worked carefully at painting out the image of a tree. “It’s living matter. The tree grows slowly, creating more leaves every year, always increasing in the life it creates. The flame, Eros, burns bright, but once used up it dies away.”
Dean studied Lanie a moment longer, then followed the direction of her gaze. Young Dean settled on the motorbike and started the engine. He looked over his shoulder once and waved at them before taking off.
Cas looked ready to leave again, but Dean spoke once more, forever reluctant to give him up, even as he protested over and over that he didn’t care to talk, thought they should rest, would give anything not to be accountable to someone. “Cas?” He had his eyes on the edge of the kitchen sink, able to tell Cas had stopped again in the doorway, but unable to look at him. He pulled himself together enough to continue, doing a terrible job of sounding off-hand as he said, “Sorry if he made you uncomfortable. If he suggested something. He didn’t know you’re a friend.”
Dean passed the phone off to Jack after that, taking a shower while Jack gave a few more details about their hunt so far, and asked about Sam and Eileen. Jack was done the call by the time Dean was out, picking up his watch and thinking it was about time to get them some food.
“Dean goes back next,” said Amara. “We’ll check in with Mary. And then we sort out the rest of this place.”
“Right,” said Past-Cas. “The car-baby. It is…” He looked around the parking lot, where the cars were not necessarily sporty, but certainly more recent. “It is not a very young car, comparatively.”
“Yeah,” said Sam. “And I also want you to know… I made plans with Joel and Sharif later to have a zombie movie marathon at Joel’s house. So, you know. I’ll stay over there.”
The cold, high moon painted the edges of the clouds. Dean saddled Baby—she was a horse again tonight—going through the process of securing the tie strap, scratching fingers through her black mane as he slipped the bridle on. Thinking all the while of where they got it wrong in those last, chaotic moments of their final fight with Chuck.
Young Dean looked at Cas with a shade of wonder. Sometimes the more he got to know Dean the more different he felt from him, but then something would happen that snapped it all back into line again. One day, Young Dean would be
Cas appeared on the grassy strip that sloped towards the door of a small, tidy ranch. Wind shifted the feather-soft grass, lush and green. Mountains, tall and ridged and capped with snow, filled out the skyline beyond the trees. The mineral scent of rock and pine and the deep notes of lichen and country earth filled the air. The first words he heard in his head, clear as a bell:
“I can pick up on a longing,” said Past-Cas, his dry expression turning into something more thoughtful as he looked at Young Dean.
“The Winchester brothers,” said Sam, pathetically shaking the last bits of cork from his spoon into the sink. “Defeated by a corkscrew.”
Sam very deliberately took a long sip of his coffee, the cup nearly empty and likely quite cold. He swallowed it down and said, “What’s up in what way?” In an attitude of feigned innocence, his eyebrows climbed higher on his forehead than strictly needed.
“Well then, maybe I’m not too late,” said Young Dean. “This spell was supposed to take me to the time I’m most needed. I guess that’s now.”
On the other side, Scott was fairly innocuous. No aggression, no weapon, not even a scowl. He had both hands on the handlebars of his bike, the helmet dangling off of one side. “Do you mind if I bring this in?” he asked. “There’s nowhere outside to lock it, and the kids around here love to steal a bike and throw it in the river. Not a lot else to do.”
“Nothin’,” said Young Dean. He put his hands in his pockets and looked down at the ground between them. He saw he was wearing his old clothes. He didn’t have blood in his hair. His ribs and shoulders didn’t hurt from the pounding of the avalanche. Damn, Cas was a good multitasker.
“I musta been praying,” said Dean. Or simply longing for him. That ever-present ache was just part of his essential make-up at this point.
“Tell me you’re almost done the job with Bobby,” said Sam. “Dad’s driving me batshit, here. He’s been in a mood all day. He keeps making me help him with his case research but I have
The last of the sun’s golden rays were disappearing, with more light coming from the shining sword than through the dusty windows. Eileen, evading a strike from the butt of the Fisher King’s gun, stumbled hard over a fallen ladder and fell against the rubble. She crashed amongst a stash of chipped and broken flowerpots, one of which made blood bloom on her forearm.
The hazel wood was supposed to be the gateway to another realm. A Men of Letters chapterhouse in Massachusetts—hard to uncover and break into but correspondingly untouched within—had been deep into research on the subject. One confident scholar asserted that this Otherworld, appearing often and under various names in Celtic lore, would grant access to innumerable other planes of existence like some sort of supernatural business lobby or bazaar.
“Yeah, well. This whole Charles Dickens Ghost of Christmas Future bullshit is a bit of an eye-opener, let me tell you that,” said Young Dean. “I’ve never been forced to have an honest-to-god, literal conversation with myself about any of this.”
The first hag waved her webbed hand. “Sit,” she said, speaking with a watery voice. Her voice sounded old, not just in the way that time altered all things, but old like the creaking beams of a tall ship, old like the swaying of heavy oak boughs in an ancient forest.
“Oh don’t take it like that, now,” said Young Dean. “For one, I don’t like you any less. For another, I get so confused when there’s two of you. But you’re the original Cas, to me.”
“Like that,” said Jack. “It happened to him before, too, a long time ago.” Dean pressed his lips harder together, wanting to block out his life story as told by Jack. Jack was trying to be direct and sensitive all at once, but he missed all the nuance. He missed how terrible it was that, unlike the last time, after Purgatory, there was no magic moment where he turned from the mirror and Cas was finally there. How these visions were worse because the way he cared about Cas had only grown since then.
It made Past-Cas look confused and unmoored. Instead of seeking out the answer that Young Dean could provide, he had to assess his own feelings. “I… I have wanted to be close to you,” he said. “I have wanted to kiss you.”
The plan was to get as far as Kentucky today, splitting the twelve-plus hours of driving between them. An early start with a few healthy breaks and they’d be able to check into a motel in decent time. In the kitchen, Cas made coffee. He’d taken over this task in the past few weeks after telling Sam, not gently, that his coffee was ‘untenable’ and ‘an offense to nature.’
Young Dean tipped his head, doubtful and curious. Cas’ voice cut across any further commentary: “That’s not relevant to our current mission. We were discussing the point of coming of age.”
“I can do it,” Rachel insisted. “I’m a hunter. I can save us.” Even her father didn’t look at her, not daring to face the seed of doubt her very words contained.
“I know they’re bullshit,” said Dean. Cas lifted a hand to glide his fingers through Dean’s hair, thumb smoothing against his temple. Dean closed his eyes. It wasn’t just because of hunting that he thought he’d die young. He’d rather that something supernatural took him, some evil outside himself, rather than the ominous, shapeless threat promised to him. That dreadful inheritance with no escape. He wanted to go out swinging before he faced some other judgment.
“Almost like,” said Dean. “Hey, how you been, anyways? We wondered about you. We didn’t know if we’d ever hear from you.”
Behind him, a branch snapped in the woods. Distinct and unlike the rustle of wind, the birdsong, the movement of forest critters. He looked over his left shoulder, scanning the path behind him. He narrowed his eyes and turned slowly on a heel, trying to make sense of the shadows. He couldn’t be sure, but it seemed as if there were more than there should be. Nothing that made for a solid form, though. Nothing connected to a threat. He kept turning, more slowly, to face forward again, eyes peeled for anything out of place. But no, the woods just looked like woods.
Young Dean slowed to a stop, the others spaced out ahead of him in the tall, bowed grass. Dean noticed first, turning to look back.
Dean shook his head. How to begin explaining? He raised his cup of coffee to his mouth, burned his tongue for it, and swallowed hard. He had to stop thinking about all the messy things: the sense of belonging, of acceptance, of
Cas stopped kissing him for long enough to look down at his mouth, thumb tracing against the corner of Dean’s jaw over and over. “Well, I already told you,” said Cas. “A long time ago.”
On the night of November the 12th, 1998, nineteen-year-old Dean left Schaffer’s bar with sixty-eight dollars in his pocket. He didn’t know how it got there, but he knew it wasn’t for nothing. He’d won ten bucks out of a game of pool earlier, and he had four dollars and eighty-two cents as leftover change in his pocket from indulging in a beer and fries at the bar. And then there was this unaccounted-for wad of bills folded in the shape of someone’s wallet.
Young Dean faltered, looking at Cas, at Past-Cas, finding help nowhere. “I thought Past-Cas could find Sam once we got here. Take us to him, or pull him out of danger, but… but he’s hidden from us. The Jody lady too.”
“Sometimes I’m even hungry,” Cas said. His focused gaze came alive with something like pride and excitement. Excited to be more human. Well, thought Young Dean, wasn’t that something.
“You sound like you already have some idea,” said John. He was canny, didn’t underestimate his sons, but the foray into obscurity worked like a kind of doublespeak. Accusing and encouraging Dean to implicate himself in one breath.
“No,” said a voice from across the room. “It really isn’t.” Zachariah stepped out from the shadows. He’d taken the vessel Dean and Cas recognized, a few years younger with a little more colour in his hair.
“I don’t think that’ll work,” said Holden. “First of all, you can’t get in. They only take, ah… ‘handsome youths.’” He placed a hand just under his chin, paired with an apologetic look. It was an attempt at humour that quickly faded. “You’ve aged out. Secondly, it’s been twenty years,” he said. “If my math’s right, that’s over seven thousand years in that place. I guarantee you I’m not still alive there. But hey. There is something you could do for me, in your time. Look up Ronnie? Veronica Valle. Make sure she’s doing good.” He fixed on a smile again. “Hell, maybe I did make it out and the only reason you can’t find me is ‘cause I took her name.”
“It’s the Santa Ana winds south of us. It’s not good for the supernatural,” she said, emptying the scorched contents of her pan into the trash. “People who
“Guess I was,” said Sam, shifting in the back seat to stretch out his long legs. “Hard to remember it, nowadays. I forget what it was like, being so angry all the time.”
Eli shook his head. “You know more about it than I do,” he said. “If it comes around, I run. I can’t stand to look at it. It makes me feel sick.”
“Same as usual,” Dean said. He got the car into a space he could back up, then straightened out to drive forward, the palm of his hand sliding against the wheel through these rotations. “He wasn’t ever here, from the sounds of it. There were about a dozen in the compound, looked like they’d come out the wrong side of a war. We might find a lead in the Sierra Nevada? Another compound like this one. Hell if I know. Had enough of these fucking mountain people, I tell you. Hard to say if their intel’s worth anything. They were some low-level Arimaspians, am I right, Past-Cas?”
Castiel turned his head sharply to squint out at the water in a poor attempt at concealing the way his lips quirked in a smile, guilty in his sense of personal vanity or pride. Dean suspected that Cas had never been anyone’s best anything before.
“I’ve met some of the people you hang around with,” said Dean. “I don’t think you were ever lacking ‘interesting.’”
Dean gave himself a minute of just looking in the fridge, then pulled a few bottles out of a six-pack. He opened the first and took a swallow. Cas came into the kitchen and leaned back against the fridge.
He disappeared from the spot, reappeared over the demon who now had Young Dean pinned to the floor of the hallway. The silver of his angel blade flashed in his hand and he stabbed the demon between the shoulders. No sooner did the light flicker from its eyes than Cas was gone again, appearing at Dean’s side. One demon held Dean’s arms behind his back while another stood before him and reeled back her fist for a punch. Cas caught the demon’s wrist as she swung and brought his other hand to the side of her head. Dean winced against the brightness, seeing red through his eyelids and dots dancing across his vision as the demon’s body collapsed.
“That’d be great,” said Dean, ruthlessly abusing the sarcastic offer to dip his head in and kiss Cas. Cas—every bit as devious and incorrigible because he had learned half his humanity from Dean—had to soften an amused smile just before their lips met.
Holden laughed, winced. “Uh, one time was baseball? When I was eight. The other time was a high school sex accident. I’ll spare you the details.”
Dean lingered back while Jack knocked on the front door, glancing around in the meantime. The house had an open garage-shelter on the side where the car was parked, surrounded by the usual riffraff of lawn-care equipment, a bicycle, a barbeque, and some old cans of paint and stains. Around the garage and the front door, there weren’t many signs of feminine touches. There weren’t signs of any other person’s taste. No second bicycle for company. No partner. No kids.
“I said you wouldn’t believe me,” said Dean. “I know it sounds insane, but I’ve had Bobby’s help on this since and he can back me up. I time travelled two weeks ago, returned the same night I left, and I did it again last week.”
But there was no inexplicable gap in his evening. There was no dirtiness or discomfort about his person. There was just money in his shirt like someone had pick-pocketed him in reverse. Maybe someone took pity on him? But for all he faced monsters and ghosts on the regular, the idea of anything about himself provoking random compassion stretched beyond what he was capable of believing.
“He thought I wanted other things. I just thought you should know that. It doesn’t seem fair to pretend otherwise. It feels like lying.”
He set down his bag on the remaining bed, too familiar with outdated motels to sniff at the green-patterned eye-sore of a comforter. He took out one of his guns and stashed it in the drawer of his bedside table, next to the Gideon Bible. He eyed Jack as he closed the drawer again.
Young Dean awoke in his garret bed, though he didn’t remember leaving the garden. Had he climbed to the attic himself, or had he fallen asleep on the grass, head pillowed against Past-Cas’ stomach? It would mean Past-Cas transported him here. He could do it with a touch, as easy as breathing, but the fact he could do it without Young Dean even noticing was what surprised him.
Dean leaned back a little in the seat, looking out at the road and letting it be his only focus for a long moment.
There was a sound from the hall, someone muttering and fast feet on the floor. “Cas?” A knock on the door, even if the handle was already turning. “Cas, you up? Teen-Dean’s mi—” Dean cut himself off when Young Dean craned to look over his shoulder.
Young Dean shook his head quickly. He risked looking over at Past-Cas again. It was a mistake. He couldn’t look away. “No,” he said. “I was just really worried about you. That’s all. It’s been a long day.”
“Heaven,” said Dean. “They thought I messed with the plan, messed with one of their angels, so they brought him back to Heaven. They’re gonna wipe his memory. They’re gonna
“Oh man,” said Young Dean, falling into step to follow Holden and Sam down the trail back towards the picnic shelter. “You just let him walk all over you, don’t you?”
A low murmur of thunder rolled through the clouds above them, a distended and ambling reverberation. Dean leaned his forehead against Cas’. “And you say I’m smooth,” he said. “Cas, I can’t keep
“Cas fixed all that stuff up,” said Dean. He held up his right hand and wiggled his fingers, which were pretty well-aligned. “Scars and bullet wounds and all that. There’s been new ones since, but if Cas is around at the time he sets it right.”
Young Dean gave a small nod in return, sweeping his gaze over the books on the table. “Which of these has the most on griffins?” he asked.
- “Try to Praise the Mutilated World” by Adam Zagajewski, translated from the Polish by Clare Cavanagh
Young Dean knew his ruse was up. He only hoped that Past-Cas wouldn’t be too disappointed in him. Even if he deserved it.
“Of course,” said Cas, and he shifted, mirroring Dean’s pose. The crossed legs, the loose posture. His grey blanket still covered his lap. His shirt looked soft and wrinkled.
“It’s okay if you aren’t,” said Past-Cas. “It doesn’t matter to… to Castiel.” His brow furrowed over these careful words. “He loves you either way.”
“He isn’t the only one who’s tired. Where's everyone sleeping?” Eileen asked. She’d been in the shower as spots were divvied up. “Do we need to make up the couch?”
“I’d rather not go into it,” said Young Dean, glancing at the others. “They have something we need to save someone we care about, that’s all there is to it.”
“Sure it’s my business. I’m you. And I’m the one who got you together. So it’s double my business. I just wanna know what we have to look forward to. You know what they say: angel in the streets, demon in the—”
“Oh,” said Past-Cas. “You need to sleep. Humans require sleep to execute basic functions and maintain psychological coherence. I am keeping you from this. You should have said.”
Inside the dilapidated farmhouse, Sam managed the four newly released Thralls. They were disoriented and run down, too dazed to work into a panic. They felt for the first time the sores on their bodies and the aches in their muscles. Sam calmly explained that they were safe now, that emergency services had been called and were on their way, but that the hunters had to be long out of sight before any of the teams arrived. Those who had been under the Fisher King’s influence for longer had dimmer memories of their previous lives, but Young Dean said it was nothing food, rest, and decades of therapy wouldn’t cure.
“Listen well,” said the second hag, swaying forward, then leaning one elbow on her knee to stay upright. Young Dean did his best to pay attention, despite the bottle coming around to him again. He took another eye-watering mouthful: the lip of the bottle tasted increasingly of sea brine.
Dean tried to prise at its long fingers, his nails scrabbling against rough bark. Moss-damp to the touch, fleshy and woody at once, with insects crawling in and over gaps. The great, white eyes of the beast stared into Dean.
“We should leave here,” Cas suggested, looking around with narrowed eyes. “We’re causing waves in Heaven.”
Young Dean was in a backwards free-fall. He’d left his heart and breath on the ceiling, his body racing down to the floor, his arm extended up with a reaching hand as if he could still stop what was already happening. There was barely time for it, but he felt water in his wide eyes. He didn’t want to die.
“Dean! Dean, stop.” Sam had to pull him back from the unsound terrain. “We won’t find them that way.”
“And I knew that,” said Young Dean. “But with the griffin…” He lost his words for a moment. He looked up at the popcorn ceiling. He couldn’t look at the expectant faces around him. “You said I was pure enough. And what if I was, but I’m not anymore?”
Sam leaned his hip against the counter, sighing and chewing his tongue. “Look, don’t hold this against him, but Teen-Dean… He told me about it. He, basically, came out to me.”
Dean didn’t understand all the rules perfectly. He and John went hunting sometimes. Mary declined. They didn’t hunt ghosts or vampires, but deer. Fowl. Small game. Apparently there were no ethical concerns about shooting deer in Heaven. Dean often enough saw the deer get up again after a few minutes and carry on. It wasn’t like he and John planned to carve it, skin it. You didn’t need to carve a deer in Heaven. Hell, you didn’t even need to eat.
“Cas,” said Dean. His mouth parted, vexed as he searched out the words, a frown in his brow. He looked pissed-off. “You been thinking that way all this time?” He turned his head towards the sky, giving a scoff that his heart wasn’t fully in. “And you say I’m messed up.”
“You’re such a freaking dad, Cas,” said Dean. He clapped a hand on Cas’ shoulder. “Come on, let’s move out.”
He hadn’t wanted to leave. He remembered that feeling. That Sam and Dean and Cas treated him like a brother or a son, but in the way one should be treated. Dean didn’t remember the last time John hugged him. But Sam and Cas and even Dean, they did it like they knew he needed it, even though it would never occur to him to ask. He would’ve stayed just a little longer if he could.
I’m waiting for you, I’m waiting for the evening calm, I’m waiting for our time, the oblique light, this pause between day and night. Peace will come, surely. But I can imagine no other peace than that of our two bodies bound together, of our gaze given over to each other - I have no other homeland but you.
They did not step or glide. Young Dean couldn’t say by what mechanism they moved, only that they pressed ever closer. He began to scramble backward, never taking his eyes from the Watchers because to give up attention for even a moment would be fatal. He stumbled in the dirt but never stopped moving, unable to look behind him. Dust covered his jeans and shoes and hands.
“Don’t,” said Dean, though his voice sounded weak. “Don’t. It’s different. You can’t let me think of you as someone separate.”
Essie, filling the cistern of the coffee maker for the second time that morning, suddenly stopped pouring. “Abrasax,” she said. “Abraxas.”
“Castiel,” said Holden, playfulness transforming into awe, which shortly gave way to a sharp and keen focus. He offered out his hand. “It’s an honour.”
He intended to get to work on his final Math course when he made it back to the motel, but he felt exhausted in a way he couldn’t account for. John wasn’t here. John wouldn’t know if he took twenty minutes to nap. He fell onto the bed fully-clothed and above the blankets.
“You should finish up here,” said Dean. “We’re making an early start tomorrow. The lead we have on a griffin is up past the Wind River Range in Wyoming. We’ll drive, break at a motel, and go from there. How you feeling, Cas?”
“Oh boy, we’re really doing this,” said Young Dean. He laughed bitterly, resting his hands on his hips and turning out to face the water. He narrowed his eyes against the bright sun and shook his head. “You possessive son-of-a-bitch,” he said. “You think you get to call those shots?”
The liquid surface rippled, then circled around the edges of the bowl, swirling like an ocean eddy. The water rose beyond the brim, still swirling faster, a tempest in a teapot, then crashed on itself into the centre. A simmering steam began to rise from the bowl, the concoction muting into a wine-dark purple.
Young Dean looked at the tall door in front of them. He wasn’t ready. And it was the only thing he could think about. He gave a nod of his head. “Alright,” he said.
In the middle of the loft, working below the light of a few caged bulbs, Eliza moved around from the side of a still figure.
They snuck across the land and made it to the back of the house without being spotted. Broken window screens would have made it easy to get into the mudroom’s side entrance even if it had been locked, but no one here seemed to notice if doors hung off their hinges. The narrow mudroom ran along the length of the house, offering a labyrinthine path to reach a side door at the end. The place was filled up with junk: broken wicker chairs and deteriorated roof shingles, haphazard boxes of smashed picture frames and discarded kitchen novelties, stacks of yellowed magazines, a trash bag overflowing with mouldy plush animals with ripped seams. A row of rubber boots so sunbaked they began to crumble sat on either side of the door at the end, left hanging open.
“I just mean it must be nice to be all-powerful again. And maybe that makes you want to stay here. I guess… I don’t want you to resent it if you go back to fading-grace.”
Dean woke up when Cas made it back around three a.m. He pushed himself up on an arm and rubbed tiredly at one eye. “How’d it go up there?” he asked.
“I haven’t exactly been able to ask,” Eli said over his shoulder. Again with the sarcasm. Dean wanted to roll his eyes, whether or not it made him a hypocrite. “But yeah. I mean, maybe. How many evil things can there be in the woods before you get a turf war?”
Young Dean put a hand over his heart and closed his eyes. “True love’s first kiss.” He broke into a laugh before Sam’s panic could fully settle in. “I’m joking. Sort of. It’s one better. Her lover must bring her little cakes.”
“They seemed like enough of a problem in the future I thought it wouldn’t hurt,” said Young Dean. “Bobby sent Sam and me necklaces to keep from possession.” He drew out a silver chain from underneath his t-shirt. “I couldn’t remember what the tattoos looked like exactly, or I’d have got one already.”
“I cannot help you,” said Cas. Dean looked at his shoes again, not knowing why he’d hoped that this Cas might have a soft spot for him. “Although,” Cas said, as if to merely finish the train of thought, “it has certainly been achieved by humans before and left as a matter of record in their safehouses and bunkers.”
“No.” Dean wet his lips. “I mean. I don’t think so. You just aren’t there yet. You took out the ‘Brokeback Mountain’ book.”
Ever since getting together with Eileen, Sam took to texting more. Habit, really. Dean didn’t mind texting, sure, but he had habits of his own. He pressed the button to dial Sam’s number and brought the phone to his ear.
” and also, who am I kidding, the entire second stanza, here you go, you get a post-script so we can all weep to Leonard Cohen songs together:
“Then you would rather that Teen-Dean and myself go now to Carmel,” said Past-Cas. “Perhaps I can read Jody’s soul and it will remember what her mind doesn’t.”
Sam laughed. “You make it sound like such a trial. You heard the part where I want you to be happy, right?”
“I don’t want him to get upset,” said Dean. “Or try to get involved. And I want him to stay put, here. Sammy likes his new school.”
Sam got up in the night for a glass of water, passing through the living room. He moved quietly in order not to disturb the older Dean stretched out on the couch. He startled to see that Dean wasn’t alone; he’d fallen soundly asleep with his head on Cas’ lap. Cas, perfectly awake, didn’t seem to mind that he had nothing else to occupy him apart from the occasional brush of his fingers through Dean’s short hair. Still, it gave Sam pause, and he opened his mouth to speak, but cut off. Not only would it certainly wake Dean, he didn’t know what he meant to say.
He wanted to talk but he didn’t know how. Teen-Dean would know. Lately, it seemed hard to make the kid shut up. He hadn’t been like that so much in the past, Dean knew that perfectly well, but since coming to the future he’d apparently decided every feeling and every thought was up for discussion. In some ways, it wasn’t a bad way to live. He didn’t get stuck guessing. Didn’t get stuck doubting.
Cas put a hand on Dean’s shoulder. As always, the shape of his grip echoed down from skin to soul. “Dean,” he said.
» this was a blast to write and share and your feedback is & has been everything to me so, like, round of applause to you
Cas tipped his head in answer, a wavering sort of agreement without committing to certainty. “We did our research, and had options between twelve and twenty-one, as far as we can tell in griffin lore. I thought that under eighteen would be unfair to you as a minor—” Dean began to disagree with him, but Cas cut him off. “You, for the record, called me an idiot and threw ‘contemporary American definitions’ back in my face. Which… Perhaps. I know you’ve dealt with terrible monsters at a much younger age, but I don’t want to be the one forcing them on you.”
Cas didn’t look at Dean, but his lips twisted in the faintest smile, like something his mouth wasn’t used to doing.
It was Sam but Sam was older, taller, hair longer. Meeting him in a hug to say how relieved they were to find him alive. Someone else who said,
“What’s wrong with the car?” said Dean. “I know Sam’s gassy—” Sam hit him harder this time “—but we’ve got the windows down and she’s not bad for space. We’re switching out drivers.”
“We can return to the present as we know it,” said Cas. “Listen, Dean.” And he paused, lips parting, as if he were in turn listening to something. “There is no ‘time,’ there is only ‘change.’ In fact, change is everything we measure. I can perceive the past, but I cannot perceive future changes that I have not experienced.”
“I already knew what Dad thought,” Dean said. He prodded at a package of new potatoes wrapped in tinfoil for something to do.
Cas didn’t seem to notice or mind that it wasn’t. He sat down on the edge of the daybed, hip against Dean’s thigh.
“We were trying to reach me and Cas,” said Dean. “I mean in the future. The present, I guess. We’ll get out of your hair, alright?”
Dean dragged a hand over his mouth, shaking his head. “This is so fucked up,” he said. “You’re telling me we only took out that book because we were remembering Wyoming happening.”
Young Dean nodded his head, still unable to look away from the injuries on his older body. Cas looped the bandages once more below Dean’s back, then taped it off. His fingers tested the tightness, slipping just underneath the edge. Cas gave a nod that it would do, chiefly to himself, but Young Dean let go of a piece of his worry. Cas wouldn’t let anything happen to Dean.
“Okay,” said Young Dean. He rubbed his hand against his cheek. That hot wind ruffled through his hair and left him feeling oddly empty. He felt like a piece of himself was missing. “Nothing will happen. I wouldn’t put anyone through that.”
Dean laughed weakly, tipping his head so that he looked back at the roof of the car. “What do you know?” he said. “You were pure enough after all.”
Young Dean angled forward to watch Cas and Dean walk a short stretch down the beach. They came to rest with Dean leaning against the top of a picnic table that had seen better days and shifted with his weight.
“Don’t brush me off with, ‘it’s complicated,’” said Young Dean. “Goddammit, Dean, I know what goes through
“This from the guy who ordered every single item off the Room Service menu when the British Men of Letters brought us to a real hotel,” said Sam, looking over his shoulder to Young Dean and Cas.
Dean shoved away from the counter, opened the fridge, and pulled out a bottle of beer for Young Dean. He crossed to the doorway, offering it out. “Here you go, kid.”
Young Dean knelt on the ground, sword in hand, looking at the wasted body of the Fisher King. Through the screened windows of the mudroom, lights moved. First the blue and white tones of cell phones and flashlights, a deeper blue flare of healing magic, then the yellow glow of hurricane lanterns found and lit.
If he hadn’t gone to the future, if he hadn’t seen what he could have instead, Dean never would have made it here. He wouldn’t even poke his nose out of the closet. Would barely acknowledge to himself, even at forty, the things he felt. But he wasn’t lying when he said he felt free there. He could act without fearing the consequences. He looked at his future self and saw that his buried feelings didn’t make him less of a man, that he was already enough just as he was. The acceptance he found there, the promise of love, made him want to shout from the rooftops. No matter how unwise it would be.
It must have happened when he blinked. The face he looked at had altered. Some lines smoothed out while others sharpened. His hair was a little longer, wavier at that length. His eyes looked positively doe-like.
Young Dean turned his head and chewed his lip, thinking back. “The griffin one?” She’d helped him find the title in the card catalogue. Was he the one who got her onto hunting?
She cast a quick look at him, blushed, then bounced a couple of times on the balls of her feet. “Guess everybody saw that, huh?” she said. All of a sudden shy, like she hadn’t made a surprisingly crude gesture at her dad’s back just moments before.
“What kind of signal?” Dean asked. He was already gesturing for Past-Cas to come closer, to be at the ready.
“Well then what are you here for?” Dean asked. “You don’t look like a cheap beer and cheese puffs kind of guy. No offense.”
“I can believe it,” said Dean, watching Holden now showing Sam how to use his thumb and perspective tricks to measure distances. “More of a camp counsellor, maybe.”
“Oh! Essie’s Lanie!” said Young Dean, putting it together. His bright grin was absolutely sincere. “We know your mom. She helped us with a hunt once.”
“I won’t remember… any of this?” He looked at the device on the table between them, blank again now, where his picture had been. He looked at Castiel, with his sharp blue eyes and unflinching attention. He’d opened up a whole world, made everything seem so big, and now Dean knew how small it would be again after. He wouldn’t remember otherwise, but it still felt like a loss.
His hand found the doorknob that opened onto the parking lot. He stepped back over the threshold and John had no control over him anymore.
John would tell him not to expect anyone else to do the job right or to truly have Dean’s back. Outsiders would only have their own best interests at heart. John said not to count on anyone, himself included, because in the end, Dean only had his own wits and skills to survive another day by.
“None of us ever said the new world would be a cakewalk,” said Dean. “Not having God around will make some things easier, anyway. But listen, one thing at a time. Eliza, we won’t keep you.”
“We checked with the other kid after, just to make sure. Waylon. He thought we’d call him crazy, but he’s pretty sure he saw Cas too.” Another silence. Dean said, “Do you believe me now?”
Betty stopped rocking in her chair as Dean spoke, her small, round eyes focusing in. “I might have a better understanding than you could know,” she said. “Please, don’t think anything is too strange for me to believe.”
“All I know is I’ve seen shit no one else would ever believe,” said Young Dean, though he spoke fast now, a note of panic in his voice. “Who does the Grail serve?” Trying another tack.
“We’re looking at tomorrow night,” Sam answered. “We need Cas at full power to zap you out if it gets hairy.”
Bobby hummed, leaning back in his chair and crossing his arms over his chest. “Well,” he said after a moment’s thought. “How’s about we take a look at these Man of Letters time travel books you got and make sure you haven’t messed up the timeline for good? You’ve heard about the grandfather paradox, right?”
“Wish we could,” said Young Dean. “But it’s in dad’s line of sight so I don’t risk it. When I know dad’s far off, or deep in a hunt, I try to visit. He’s been helping me as much as he can with the Heaven stuff. We ransacked nearly every Men of Letters chapterhouse we could break into.”
Dean returned to the library enough times that week that by Wednesday he no longer needed Essie’s help to sign on to the clunky library computers and connect to the Web. On Thursday, he hotwired a car after seeing Sam off to school and broke into an abandoned Men of Letters chapterhouse halfway across the state. There were many things he could have poached as useful plunder, but he took only the books he thought might help him. He ditched the car at the edge of town, wiping it clean of his prints, and made it to back to the motel before Sam could know he’d been gone.
“I don’t know,” said Dean with a shake of his head. “I don’t know what that world will look like. We’re not gonna pretend like everything will be sunshine and roses just because you had a preview of the future. You have to know you’re taking a risk, here, too.”
Young Dean looked up at Sam with concern. “Can’t he have flown himself out of there? Demons can show up out of nowhere. Can’t angels do the same?”
“I dunno,” said Young Dean, shaking his head. “I just thought I could help. I helped before, didn’t I?”
Cas squinted at Dean, and although Young Dean couldn’t say what made the expression all that different (perhaps it was just the hint of a smile), he swore he saw something softer in it.
“It says it can guide us to the secret houses of this infestation,” said Young Dean. “That’s their words. It also says it can hear me repeating everything it says out loud and that it’s very annoying.”
“Well, we can’t start soon enough,” Cas decided, pacing back a step. Dean couldn’t help grinning at the transition away from his usual heavenly patience.
Dean lifted his chin, wondering if there would be a moment he should bow out, and if this should be it. But he could keep up this strange improv skit for now. “Alright,” he said. “Hey, tell me, do I got a flying car? Jetpack?”
They planned their departure for early afternoon, which inexorably meant the rest of them had to kill time on the beach. Wallis’ doing, of course. By noon they were kitted out in swim trunks and sunglasses. Tossing down towels and treading into the water.
“I suspect he’s refreshing in some ways,” said Cas. “It’s more even. He doesn’t have a history with you the way I do. That always made things lopsided.”
They spotted the first of the Thralls just as the crumbling farmhouse came into sight. A woman and a man, both with long and tangled hair and tattered clothes. The threads had faded to a colourless grey-brown. Dried blood mixed with dirt on their bare feet and hands. The woman lifted a stone from a stacked pile beside an empty wooden water trough. She trudged slowly with the weight of the stone, crossing paths with her male partner. She laid down the stone in an identical pile, just as he placed another rock upon hers. They walked empty-handed back to their respective places, passing each other unseeingly, and did it again.
Young Dean hung up the phone in the kitchen and came out. “It’s true,” he said. “Holden’s cool. In every sense. He doesn’t care about Cas being a guy. Or an angel.”
“I was careful,” said Young Dean. “It was on my terms. The contract doesn’t start till I have Cas again, and once he’s here, well, I figured he could help me get out.”
He crossed to Young Dean as Jody left the room, patting a hand against his shoulder. “It’s your lucky break, kid,” he said. “Jody wants you for a grocery run.”
“I’m better now,” said Cas. He wouldn’t need to sleep. “I’ll stay here, though. I won’t— I won’t leave.”
“Holden sounds a little high-maintenance,” said Dean, finger catching at an ashtray cover to look inside. He opened the glove box next, gave a hum, closed it again. He pulled down the sun visor, flipped up the mirror cover, narrowed his eyes at his reflection.
“I’ll call him,” said Young Dean. “See what he’s got. Give me a minute.” He went into the kitchen, pulling down a phone from the wall and thumbing in a number from a slip of paper stuck to the side of the fridge.
Young Dean avoided Dean’s gaze for the moment, holding back a sigh and pretending like he just wanted to watch the game. He was spared for a brief moment while the bartender, a black-haired woman whose name tag read Lois, approached them with an easy, “What can I get for ya?”
“This is a somewhat more unusual circumstance,” said Cas, eyes narrowing, but a smile playing at his mouth.
“You’ll walk all over me. I get it, I get it,” said Dean. He looked over at Betty one more time. “What are we gonna do about her?” he asked.
The surrounding storm died off just after they arrived, but it did nothing to cut the day’s heat. The night air turned humid in the aftermath of intense rain, and it brought out a chorus of spring peepers filling the night air with their trill. The bungalow didn't have any kind of air conditioning, but they opened up windows and angled a few standing fans around the living room. Squatters couldn’t be choosers.
“Whose ankle?” said Cas, turning back to his groceries. “Do the strawberries go in the fridge, Dean?”
Young Dean rested one elbow on his knee, chin in hand. “Lucky you,” he said. “You get to pick the day.”
“Dean.” Cas rushed over, knelt by the older Dean with Sam. Dean was conscious, holding a shaking arm over his abdomen, trying to make himself sit up.
Cas turned to put away his coffee and salad dressing in the kitchen cupboards. Dean, absently reaching into the fridge with his fingers falling just short of the nearest bottle, appeared thoroughly distracted by Cas’ bare arms beneath the sleeves of his t-shirt.
“I know how to fill time. I’m thinking of how to explain things to Heaven when this is finished. There is a lot to consider.”
. And not just because you’re an angel. That was part of it, sure. That’s what he’d be willing to tell you. But I know it was more than that. He didn’t think anyone
Cas raised an eyebrow, folding his arms. “That I had fallen in every way imaginable,” he recited dully.
Dean slung his arm casually across the back of the cushions. Cas briefly tipped his head back against it in acknowledgement, shooting Dean a warm look from the corner of his eyes and the barest hint of a smile. Somewhere along the line they’d become masters of these subtle and clandestine intimacies. Unconscious disciples of a private language, each small gesture serving as enormous documentation of affection that no one outside themselves could fully interpret. Moment to moment they invented new expressions of love. Some days Dean swore they were the originators of it.
Jack met Dean’s gaze again. This was a second blow, another sense of having screwed up. He didn’t have time to answer as the man spoke again: “This is Scott,” he said. Dean had already figured as much.
“If it weren’t for Sammy back home… I dunno. Maybe I would want to stay around here for a little. See what it’s like.”
Dean was the last person who could talk about death being final, but it wasn’t something he could promise someone else. It wasn’t something he’d asked for himself. His numerous resurrections had been on account of divine puppeteering; not for his own sake, but for the purpose of vicious entertainment.
Dean looked through Amara, thinking of Jack under her skin. Jack holding out hope for Dean when Dean hadn’t always been worth holding out hope for.
“Alright, alright,” said Dean. “I’ll give you that one. Let’s try this place up here. And don’t burn this one on us because a town like this probably won’t have any other options.”
At his back, something shifted through dead leaves. Jack and Dean rounded, their flashlights illuminating the skeleton-grey of surrounding trees. A creeping mist wisped forward from the ground, curling around tree trunks and branches, coming nearer. Dean glanced over his shoulder to check on Eli, but the ghost had vanished.
Young Dean looked as if he knew everything Dean was thinking, even if he hadn’t been through half of what Dean had. “You’re not a bad role model,” said Young Dean. “In the end.”
Castiel didn’t show any understanding, face impassive. “Yes,” he said. “This is Jimmy Novak’s daughter. The blood spell clearly took us to her as a nearby blood relation.” He looked around himself, reading past the limitations of the room and, probably, well into the universe. He gave a nod of his head. “I am, however, confident I took us to the right time.”
“We think he’s out there,” said Jack. “But we don’t know what’s happening to him. If he’s okay, or… He’s the one leading us to our hunts lately. We’re trying to figure out if they have something to do with him. I can… I have a special connection to him. I can feel when he’s here on Earth. I felt him here in Crestwood the night of the party, but then he disappeared again. When we turned up, we found this case. It’s been like that everywhere.”
They entered the shed with the blown-out windows. Cas prepared the spell while Dean studied his shoulders under the billowy shirt, thinking of angel wings and the oil-black feather he’d touched.
“He has no real connection to me. The bond that was established between you and I in Hell doesn’t apply to him. It was nice that he came to talk anyway.”
“Hell, maybe Cas saved his skin,” said Sam. “Maybe they’re back in ‘98, or back at the motel or bunker.”
“He’s always proud of you,” said Dean. “Might be furious with me for not realizing that thing would see you as ripe for the picking. Dragging you right into danger like that.”
He looked up from the phone, found Cas’ intensely blue eyes focused on him. Did the guy always stare with that intensity? Dean felt a pulse of worry, having let his guard down. People here in Schaffer’s, could they see it? This man who looked too hard, this man with a whiff of the future about him, a whiff of something more than what the small world Dean had known till now contained.
“Before anyone else is up,” said Dean. He was used to doing this, now. Stream-of-consciousness rambling, sharing his thought process, describing his ideas with far more detail than he usually bothered to disclose. “You could probably come. He’ll talk to you.”
“I miss him,” he rasped. Trying to keep it all contained. Trying to hug his arms around himself even tighter. He shuddered a few times. “I miss him so much.”
“Christ,” Dean muttered. He lifted his coffee to his mouth, gave a shake of his head before drinking. “Poor son-of-a-bitch.”
Dean tapped his thumb against the wheel a few times. He couldn’t explain the sudden feeling that something had been cut out of him. The longest he’d been without Baby was when they had to lie low and switch out cars back when the Leviathans were at large. Sam and Cas, knowing Dean’s attachment to the car, just looked at him.
“This is part of it,” said Cas, gesturing broadly with a hand as if he could point at everything Young Dean just said. “Zeroing in on anything bad you can find, whether it’s meant that way or not.”
talking to him, when we’re the same damn person.” Another smaller sigh. “I like Cas,” he said. “I barely even know who he is, but it’s like, I trust him. He doesn’t have to give me any proof or reason why or nothing. Just like that. He says something, like he won’t let me die, and I just know I won’t die. And there is
Dean glanced up. You could barely see it. The cream-coloured paint nearly blended in with the white of the ceiling. Most casual guests dropping in wouldn’t notice, but it was enough to work. But before ‘05, there were hardly any demons around.  “What are you doing with a devil’s trap in your apartment?” Dean asked.
“Right,” said Dean. Roger probably meant it. He didn’t look like a man who gave second chances. Dean clapped a hand on Young Dean’s shoulder to guide him along. “C’mon, kiddo.”
“I’d need help,” said Amara. “Jack’s help. You might think being pulled from the afterlife is standard practice, but it’s a cosmic effort. Not to mention sorting out this mess my brother made of Heaven.” She surveyed the landscape surrounding them again, distaste barely contained. “It’s not really my area.”
“Stow it,” said Dean. “You have no idea the shit Cas and I have put each other through. The things we’ve forgiven. You think you need to be forgiven because you did what you had to in the name of getting back to him?”
Dean stood with arms folded, leaning against the counter, waiting for Sam’s door down the hall to close. He looked back at Cas. “I don’t even know what being nice is,” he said. “Was that alright? Am I supposed to go, I dunno, offer him a beer or something? Is that inappropriate?”
Sam looked out one more time. He didn’t say aloud that if that was the case, Dean and Sam would never find them. “The only thing we can do is go back to the car,” Sam said. “That was the plan. We’ll go quiet, we’ll keep a lookout and listen, but that’s where we’d meet if anything went wrong.”
He came downstairs rubbing sleep from his eyes. He took in a deep breath, passing by an open window on the staircase. Outside, the wind was gradually picking up, brushing through the tops of the trees. It moved East-to-West, towards the sea. Warm and dry, ratcheting the temperature up by a few degrees even at this early hour of the day. There was something about the way the wind blew downward through the window, depressing his senses, that made him feel out of sorts. Or perhaps it was only the strange night he’d passed that felt increasingly like a dream.
“Cas, man,” said Young Dean, barely holding himself together. “I regret it, okay? I regret coming here against your orders and pulling Past-Cas in along with me. I’ve learned my lesson. If I could go home now I’d have half a mind to, but I still want to protect Sam. I’m gonna help, okay? I’m gonna be useful to you.”
Past-Cas’ eyes wandered unseeingly along the edge of the coffee table. “Angel possession can have a terrible effect on vessels, and I would not now easily make the decision to take one. But the Novak line seems particularly resilient.” He looked up at Claire. “To see him like this must be a burden to you, Claire. I’m sorry for that.”
“I don’t know what the spell was,” said Castiel. “The best I can do is put him under until we figure out the counter-curse.”
“Didn’t ask for an explanation. Didn’t give me the chance to say I hadn’t known. Not that he’d have believed me. And there I was— I didn’t even understand what he was so mad about, at first. He laid into me like— Not before or since did I ever see him as mad as that.”
» if you need to know when this takes place narratively, let's say it's some pocket-world time in Season 15, because if this fic proves anything it's that time is fake and linearity is for squares
“I've spent most nights looking into it. It was clear as soon as I arrived that Lawrence Novak’s fate meant something to all of you,” said Past-Cas. “I didn’t understand why, but you all immediately decided to bear the guilt for it. I thought it would be some assurance to myself,” he gestured to Castiel, “and the Deans if I were to investigate.”
Dean folded his arms over his chest, bowing his head in thought. In some ways it had been easier to look at Eli, born the same year as Dean but preserved eternally in his youth. As if, but for being dead, he still had all his options ahead of him. Not as easy looking at Scott, the same age Dean was now, feeling like everything had been over for a long time. And that it had never properly started. But that was the wrong way about it, completely back-asswards.
“I don’t think… I don’t think I deserve to go to Hell,” said Young Dean, frowning, discovering the truth even as he spoke it. “But I ain’t pure.
“Because of a lot of reasons,” said Cas. “Mostly through choices I made on my own, but—” Cas’ lips parted faintly. “I never would’ve rebelled against Heaven if I hadn’t met Dean.”
me.” He looked at Mary directly, their eyes meeting properly for the first time in he didn’t know how long. “It was the very last thing he said.”
“You won’t miss it,” said Cas. “It will be harder on Dean, on you in the future, but he knows that already. Or he thinks he does. Now that I’m here, I can’t help thinking…”
Reid Jenkins had a couple hours’ drive before he made it there, and Young Dean couldn’t be convinced to leave Past-Cas’ side, even if he ought to get some shut-eye while he had the chance. Jody and Essie, with enough years of hunting and parenting between them, knew to catch rest where they could get it.
Cas smiled. It made his eyes look warm, breaking apart any pretense of the icy disposition he so often tended towards. Dean knew the truth. For all his stone-faced seriousness, Cas was a soft touch when it came to Dean. A lovestruck angel too romantic for his own good.
“I know,” said Dean. “Most hunters don’t have long lifespans. But you and me… We’re pretty good at it. I mean, I think we’re pretty amazing hunters in the future.”
. And all Dean had put him through, had said to him. Chuck disappeared and it was like these floodgates of affection opened. Feelings that had been stymied because Chuck hadn’t been able to give up his family dramas and needed Dean to act accordingly. Cain and Abel, Abraham and Isaac.
Dad. “books you would find in the back of your dad’s car” is among my favourite of the Forgotten Genres.
Dean was silent for a moment. “He lit the rental car on fire,” he repeated, very quietly. Then, “Alright, Sam, we’re sending someone out there for you. We’ll see you sooner than you think.” He ended the call and looked to Past-Cas. “He’s somewhere in Death Valley. You’re looking for a burning car, and a guy about yea high standing on top of some hill nearby.”
“Gee, thanks Pops,” said Young Dean, the sarcastic response arriving on auto-pilot. He had the grace to look a shade contrite, after. “I mean. Thanks. I’ll let you… get back to it.” He raised the unopened bottle in a feeble salute.
“We don’t know,” Young Dean said uneasily, still unsure of the close timing between this adventure and Lawry’s death.
That’s when he did it. When he went from lazily parrying blows to a full-on affront. It was like he’d flipped a switch, became a machine. Young Dean barely had time to react, couldn’t strike out because he was so busy trying to prevent blows from landing. The moves were familiar, all his own, but harder and smarter and quicker than he’d ever delivered them before. Dean clipped him more than once, kept throwing him off balance so that Young Dean was stumbling just to stay on his feet, let alone find a stance with any power to it. When he tried to get a good punch in, Dean caught him harder than before. In a flash he had Young Dean’s arm twisted up behind his back, his whole body turned, and Dean stood just behind him, his condescending snarl in Young Dean’s ear.
