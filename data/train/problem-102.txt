“You are so bad, Sherlock Holmes. What am I to do with you?” John inquired as he reached down and tugged on the detective’s cock a few times, getting his hand wet and dripping in the process.
If the hitch in his breath was any indication, Sherlock was definitely surprised and not by anything happening on the screen. But wisely, he remained otherwise quiet. His good bitch knew better than to disobey his alpha.
“Of course,” he said sweetly, tipping John’s head back so he could place a chaste kiss on his forehead.
“Un-uh, no you don’t,” John responded as he held firm and gave Sherlock’s succulent arse another slap so hard it made his cheeks jiggle.
“Fucking cock sucking whore.”
“Oh,” John hesitated for a moment before he started working his hand up and down Sherlock’s throbbing shaft. “And here I thought you wouldn’t want to continue.”
“Unnnnghhh,” Sherlock moaned. Quickly followed by an, “Aaaaahhhh!” as John pulled his spit-slicked fingers from his mouth and snuck his hand under one of the detective’s firm and round cheeks so he could stick a finger in his arse.
Exhaustion was putting in mildly. Sherlock Holmes was so tired that it felt like every muscle of his well-formed body was aching simultaneously. It had been a long and strenuous day. So hectic in fact, that he hadn’t even had the time to take a piss. What a relief it was to finally be home. He couldn’t wait to just relax and decompress.
However, his wonderings didn’t stop Sherlock from pushing his ass back on John's delightfully long and thick appendage. He was too greedy for cock to fill his back bitch hole to care about it too much at the moment.
This last slap made Sherlock’s hips buck and his already painfully hard member brushed against the side of John's thigh.
“Damn, well I guess we’ll just have to keep working on this sub/dom thing until we get it right,” John teased. Then leaning in a bit more, he placed a gentle kiss on the top of Sherlock’s head and whispered, “I love you.”
“That depends on whether we are referencing cock or pain.”
With every thrust, John punctuated his actions with words.
“Nice sentiment, but wrong answer, bitch.”
His actions halted and fumbling, John grabbed the shower nozzle down from the wall and started to do his best to rinse away any evidence of suds or bubbles that clung to Sherlock’s skin. Turning down the temperature slightly so as not to cause any more discomfort, John did his best to hose out Sherlock’s ass. Directing the stream of water in and then letting it run back out of the pretty pink gape he had made. He repeated the action until the water ran clear of any trace of soap.
“No,” John scolded, pushing Sherlock off of him with one hand as he reached up and grabbed the detachable showerhead from off the wall with the other. “Still too sensitive. I’m not ready for another round yet.”
The doctor’s frantic motions indicated that, with all the build-up, he wouldn’t last long. The wet rapid sounds of skin on flesh and the groan of some sort of beast preceded John's climax. Eyes rolling back and breathing heavily, he ejaculated onto Sherlock’s upturned face.
Stopping abruptly, he caught sight of his boyfriend, fully clothed, sitting on a straight-backed chair in the sitting room, a look of pure lust on his face.
“Yes, sir,” Sherlock yelped.
It also helped that the twinge of embarrassment he felt at the intimate nature of being internally cleaned sent exquisite shivers up and down his spine and made his cock ache. The damn thing had a mind of its own and had stayed very much erect the entire time despite its owner’s torment.
“Ah, I see that someone is greedy and impatient today.”
“Stop,” John ordered when the detective was less than a foot away from him. “Undo your trousers.”
Raising himself up on his elbow, Sherlock looked into blue eyes. His expression flickered from scepticism to awe. He smiled then, grinning like a boy who’d just won the best prize at the funfair.
“That’s right,” John growled in his ear, pushing into him in one strong soapy thrust. “Fuck yourself on my dick you fucking bitch. I’m going to get that dirty whore hole of yours so clean. Clean enough I might be tempted to stick my tongue in it when I’m done.”
“Tell me,” John demanded, “tell me you’re a dirty boy who wants his whore hole cleaned out.”
“You’d look so sweet all bruised and bleeding for me.”
Adding his other hand to the fray and rubbing John’s cock, Sherlock continued, “You be so filthy, filled with all that cum. And I’d be right there, hardly able to wait to suck it all out of your dripping arse so I could fill you up with my own.”
This action only led to another inevitable leak.
“Oh fuck,” John gasped, “you should see yourself, spread open on my cock and frothing. I’m going to fucking cum in your ass. You want that don’t you? Huh? Don’t you?”
Taking John's hand in his own, Sherlock smoothed his long fingers over the back of his lover’s hand. The two of them sat naked, wet, and entangled in each others’ limbs for a few moments before Sherlock took that hand he was holding and directed it towards his cock.
His forehead pressed against the relative coolness of the glass, Sherlock listened to the lewd sounds of John's fingers prepping him beneath the shower’s pitter-patter. Squirming ever so slightly at the chemical tickled resulting from John's soapy digits.
The pain was getting a bit intense and Sherlock shifted uncomfortably. Clearly,
“But—“
The film was still playing in the background but Sherlock had had the presence of mind to mute it. However, neither he nor John were paying any attention to the telly now.
“Yessir,” Sherlock gasped, too aroused by the prospects of what would be happening next to put any more thought into audible words.
“Mind your manners, bitch. You address me as sir. Do you understand?”
These words went straight to Sherlock’s inner animalistic-self as well as to his cock. Feeling the piss dripping from his dark eyelashes and on his cheeks, he was tempted to lift his hands up and gather up as much of liquid as possible so he could smear it all over his body. Unfortunately, John chose this moment to bring the shower head back up and rinse him off once more.
“You’re just a greedy slut who wants his bitch hole filled; a fucking cum dump. I bet you think of nothing else. You want every orifice fucked and stretched so you’re left gaping.”
“Come stand right here,” John ordered as he pointed a spot next to the chair.
,” the detective groaned, enjoying the attention his ass was getting but desperately wanted more.
“John,” Sherlock called as he pushed open the wooden panelling of their door.
“Sherlock,” John begged, “I’m so sorry. I didn’t realize you were in so much pain. Please don’t be mad at me.”
Sherlock growled but cut this off when it earned him a sharp swat to his tender ass.
Just give me a second. I gotta piss.”
“Holy fucking hell,” John muttered after he caught his breath and reached down to help his boyfriend up. “That did not go as I had planned.”
Just as he should, Sherlock said nothing in response, instead did his best to assist him. In a couple quick moments, his shorts and boxers hit the floor, pooling around his ankles.
“ Sherlock,” John articulated, “come here.” The level of authority and power the doctor carried in his voice alone was impressive.
“Fuck,” John sighed before taking an index finger and swirling it around in the spent seed on Sherlock’s chest before inserting it into his mouth. “We should have sex in the shower more often.”
“Hey,” John replied as he came off Sherlock’s cock with an audible pop. “I said no talking, bitch.”
The hand around his cock had quickened in pace and Sherlock found himself coming all over his own chest and John's hand.
“I’m yours,” John panted.
While neither of them were interested in age-play, there was just a hint of boyishness in John’s voice and it went straight to Sherlock’s heart.
Lighting upon the idea of more cock, John inquired, “I wouldn’t put wanting more cock past you. Can you imagine, getting fucked by more than one cock at a time? One in your mouth and one in your ass. Maybe two if you can handle it. They’d stretch out that puckered hole so wide the skin would be smooth.”
“Breed you like the bitch you are.”
Bobbing up and down, John sucked Sherlock and tugged at his now tightening sack. The finger back in his arse was rubbing just right. John had always been excellent at multitasking. But his lover’s multitasking ability was the farthest thing from Sherlock’s mind at the moment.
"I don't understand you, sometimes," John admitted. "You'll prattle on for hours about types of tobacco smoke or woollen fibres but ask you to communicate during sex and it's like pulling teeth."
Completely helpless beneath the soft caresses, Sherlock groaned and arched his back into the pressured stream of water. John's fingers went lower until a sharp intake of breath between clenched teeth was indication enough to him that it was best to be gentle with the bruised ass.
Not wasting any time, John quickly moved his head over the detective’s crotch and began bathing Sherlocks’s cock with kisses and licks. Knowing what he liked, John pulled the skin of his testicles taut as he encased his lover’s shaft with his mouth.
Despite tightening his muscles in that region, another small spurt occurred. This was beyond humiliating.
“You’d like me to tear you in two, wouldn’t you?”
Sherlock, in particular, was having a hard time keeping his passions at bay. Their spanking session had left him so hot and bothered he’d of liked nothing better than to toss John's lithe and fit body to the floor and ravage his boyfriend’s tight arse right then and there. However, experience had taught him that fucking on hard surfaces was not the most comfortable type of encounter, leaving unwelcome abrasions and bruises on them both.
The man with the umbrella laughed. “Come come now, Doctor. You hardly need to keep Sherlock Holmes’ secrets from me.”
Sally shrugged. “Try the morgue. He likes it there,” she sneered.
Here's what happens next:
“You don’t like thinking about that, do you? Yes, your Johnny-boy will cry to his psychiatrist for a few weeks, perhaps, but he will get over it. He will realize that he’s better off with a normal life anyway, and he will get over you. And then you’ll be alone again.” Moriarty was speaking in sing-song. “Alone with no one to even think about you.”
John shook his head as he shut off the machine and wiped ultrasound jelly off his Sherlock's midsection. He wasn't alone, Sherlock was here. Here, and trapped, and relying on John to keep his body in good working order towards the day that he could use it again. And no matter how far away that day was, it made John's current situation infinitely better than his former one. Last time, the doctor had been waiting to die. This time, he was waiting for both of them to live. John gave Sherlock's wrist a squeeze, letting his steady pulse prove the point to every recess of the doctor's mind.
John sighed. Most people didn’t question such things as hugs. But most people weren’t Sherlock Holmes. So John, as always, attempted to give his unusual friend as honest and complete an answer as he could come up with.
The detective still wasn’t looking at him, which was probably why John didn’t back down. He kept watching his friend, determined.
“Sorry then.” John didn’t speak for a moment. “Text me if he shows up, alright?”
The IP had opened a spreadsheet of Biopharmaceuticals Limited’s expenditures, and was now looking at John expectantly. “Do you see it?”
Sherlock smiled, seemingly pleased with John’s enthusiasm. “Anything. Government secrets, flashdrives of missile codes, small weapons, bombs, illegal drugs, antique jewelry, whatever can be reasonably fit into a human.”
Sherlock was looking at his own damp fingers in confusion, returning them to his cheek as if to determine that the wetness he was seeing was, in fact, tears. He seemed to sense John’s anxiety and dismissed him with a wave.
Sherlock waived aside his concern. “Of course not, John. This place is a front, one factory where they’re doing what they say they’re doing to show the public. The side research they do here is to fit other people as weapons, probably people in other countries. That’s where Elihu comes in, he had loads of accounts and contacts overseas, especially in war-torn countries with little regulation. He probably arranged for some of his friends to run the smuggling components of their organizations with and through Biopharm, with the stipulation that they financially take care of his son’s empire while the stupid boy twiddles his thumbs. You see, there isn’t a shadow leader of Biopharm, it was all set up ahead of time and is just running like an old clock. Take out the gears, and it will stop with no one to repair it.””
“I have an idea,” John whispered.
Pulled out of his anxious reverie, the detective settled back down next to his blogger. They sat like that for a moment, listening to the sirens as first-responders arrived to dig them out, when John broke the silence.
John shook himself out of his reverie and handed his mobile phone over. As the other man sent a lightning-fast text, John asked, “So, the exploding IV bag was because he took your phone away?”
John smiled, but didn’t let it reach his eyes. “Thanks for the advice, then. I suppose I’ll just be going . . .” He left the room more confused than he’d been going in. He’d gotten some confirmation that Sherlock Holmes wasn’t insane, at least, but John wasn’t sure what to do with the other information he’d received. The doctor had met a lot of questionable characters in the army, and Sherlock hadn’t fit the profile of a sadist. If anything, the man seemed, for lack of a better word, misunderstood. John was surprised at how protective he already felt of the strange IP, but his instincts had served him well in the past and he wasn’t about to start ignoring them now.
The recruitment agent sighed. “Anderson, I’m with a new doctor. Someone else can deal with it.”
“Of course not!”
“Don’t you usually call people by their first names?”
Sally raised her eyebrows and looked to Detective Inspector Lestrade. He nodded, and the sergeant rose uncomplainingly to retrieve her coat, all too glad to leave the flat. Anderson, however, was more petulant.
The doctor shook his head, trying not to think about the three children Moriarty had just admitted to killing. “Leave,” spat John. “Now.”
John blinked, noticed that Lestrade was shaking him by one shoulder. Both the Detective Inspector and Sergeant Donovan were hanging back, and the long body on the floor seemed to indicate that Anderson had fainted. Lestrade was still talking, but John interrupted, indicating one of the three now-handcuffed medical students.
“But you can’t keep me safe, not all the time. If you could, Moriarty wouldn’t have captured me in the first place.” There was no presumption in the words; the consulting detective was just stating fact.
“Here you go then,” said John, as he leaned his detective against his own torso, pulling off the soft gray shirt. Pyjama bottoms were divested in the same manner, and soon the detective was leaning naked against the side of the tub while John fiddled with the faucets. It was an old building, and it took the water a while to heat up, but the doctor took the opportunity to collect another set of Sherlock’s pyjamas from upstairs. By the time he got back the water was an acceptable temperature, so John started filling the tub.
The detective wouldn’t allow himself to dwell on Moriarty’s threat in the latter part of the message. If all went according to plan, it would never be carried out. And if all didn’t go according to plan, he didn’t doubt he’d be able to manipulate a message out to John before the criminal invariably ended Sherlock’s life. It would be more damaging than if the detective were to get home and reassure John himself, but it would be better than nothing. Sherlock wondered, not for the first time, what Moriarty had meant yesterday when he’d said he’d be changing the game. The consulting detective hoped it had nothing to do with John. His flatmate was such an emotional person, he’d be highly susceptible to psychological methods of inflicting harm. Another reason John was off limits.
Sherlock was dangerously close to being bored again. True, he was in the middle of an escape attempt, but pulling strings apart was never cerebrally engaging, no matter how much his head was hurting or how dire the consequences of discovery.
“Actually, no I don’t. When I was notified that I was being subcontracted out by the army in lieu of a discharge, I was rather surprised. I don’t see why your company thought I’d be an asset.”
Sherlock gave an approximation of a horizontal shrug, then turned his head away from John. He looked uncomfortable, but seemed to be trying to hide it from the doctor, or at least get John to stop trying to figure out what it was.
“Well, directly after. You’ll operate on me, remove the organ, and I’ll be sent to recovery. The technicians will all but forget about me, and you, as it’s the organ they’ll lose their jobs if they misplace. So you can just pop upstairs with a stolen ID badge and flick the drive into place. Then you leave, I leave, and the government gets its secrets. They get quite cross if anyone has any secrets but them, you know.”
“Sooo nice to see you awake, Sherlock Holmes!”  The hair went up on the back of Sherlock’s neck. He’d known this was a plan of Moriarty’s, but actually hearing the sing-song, horribly sweet voice didn’t bode well for his current situation.  Often, Moriarty acted through third-party agents, agents likely to make mistakes which Sherlock could exploit. If Moriarty was being direct with this one, careless errors were significantly less of a possibility. Of course, Moriarty wasn’t actually in the room with him; the voice was coming from a rather low-quality speaker somewhere behind his chair, although it was difficult to tell through the significant echo as the sound bounced around the now-apparently small, probably concrete-walled room. Still, the consulting criminal hardly ever used his own voice to communicate. If this particular scheme was exciting enough to Moriarty for him to participate in such a personal manner, it would definitely require more than the average brainpower for Sherlock to puzzle his way out of it. Just the thought of it gave him an adrenaline rush.
“Good.”  A beat later, he continued. “You can be very surprising, John Watson.”
She looked even more panicked, but answered, “I think it was, at least mostly, because of how the tissue responded.”
At that, John started laughing. He knew there shouldn’t be anything funny about breaking in to morgues, but somehow there was, and then Sherlock started up too.
Moriarty positively giggled. “No questions, not this early. I’ll leave you to puzzle it around in that brain you’re so proud of.” Then, he paused.  “I doubt you’ll figure it out, but you won’t be able to keep yourself from trying. Don’t worry though—I’ll tell you soon enough!”
John knew that even if Sherlock was awake beneath his eyelids, the detective would be so out of his skull on pain meds that he probably wouldn’t be able to understand the words. And his detective wasn’t the sort to respond to just a calming tone of voice.
Sherlock was getting slightly concerned. He was still in his little cell, but as to how long he’d been there, Sherlock could no longer say. That, he recalled was one of the withdrawal symptoms for nicotine addiction: time seems to stretch. But the thing that was really concerning the detective was the trembling. That, unlike his pounding headache, was not a symptom of withdrawal from nicotine. It was related to hypoglycemia, which was caused by going too long without food. Sherlock cursed internally. Usually he could go days without eating with no affect but hunger, which was easily ignored, but these affects of low blood sugar, trembling, muscular weakness, and sluggish motion, were always more of a distraction. The detective had no patience for physical needs, putting them second to whatever he found more interesting. And, for the most part, he was able to treat his own body however he saw fit without any negative side effects. But sometimes, things like hypoglycemia would happen, which was eminently frustrating. Under normal case circumstances, this was the point where Sherlock would begrudgingly accept John’s offer of toast before returning to work. But toast wasn’t an option here, so what was normally just an annoyance became an outright problem. It would certainly be more difficult to escape a straightjacket without being noticed when one was taken to shaking uncontrollably every time one attempted even the slightest voluntary movement.
The doctor looked dumbstruck. “Thanks.”
“But I’m your doctor first. And to be an effective doctor, I have to make sure you don’t die. And if you don’t tell me what you’re doing, I can’t do that now can I?”
“Anderson!”  Lestrade rebuked his inferior. “This isn’t a drugs bust, so stop poking around or you’ll get us all killed.”
John sighed.
Now, John was sitting in the hospital room holding his best friend’s hand with two fingers absently on the pulsepoint, only half-aware of the outside world. He’d listened to the doctors, of course, but they couldn’t tell him much more than he knew already. Stable, and no indicators of brain damage, but it was a case with no precedent so the outcome was unclear.
They stepped out of the elevator and into another brushed-steel hallway. Wilkes led John to one of the thick metal doors, looked briefly through the reinforced-glass window inset, and walked into the room.
Yes, he thought. Yes, he could. Because it was for Sherlock. There were other doctors who could help everyone else, but his best friend needed him. But John wasn’t even sure he could help Sherlock, and there were people, bleeding people, who he could save for certain. It went against the very fabric of John’s being to leave anyone in need, friend or stranger, and whatever he did, Dr. John Watson knew he would be haunted by it.
John grinned and kissed his detective. “Fine, I suppose we can go to the morgue tomorrow. It will give me time to arrange things with Mycroft and Lestrade, plus it’s unlikely you’d get access today anyway as it’s Molly’s day off.”
John wasn’t entirely sure what had woken him up. The room’s little second-hand bed wasn’t horribly uncomfortable, and the facility wasn’t inordinately noisy. If anything, the room seemed a bit too quiet.
James Moriarty was right in front of him, blind behind the door, and he had his gun.
“What do you know about all of this?” John had zeroed in on a lifeline, a miraculous, deus-ex-machina lifeline, and he was about to use it.
John hiked up the pajama shirt he'd put on his flatmate and spread the ultrasound jelly over the impossibly pale skin. He was careful to avoid the pale pink incision site, even if danger of infection was virtually past.
John couldn’t help but stare as Sherlock explained.
“Alright,” said John, swallowing his surprise at the breadth of information Mycroft had at his disposal. “We’ll be needing more computers if we’re going to sort all of this. Mrs. Hudson, do you have a computer downstairs?” She nodded, and John continued on. “So then you should go turn it on and see if you can track the ambulance. Detective Inspector, you find out who hired the ambulance. I’ll look through the records for anything unusual there.”
Which brought him to the fifth character seated at the table, who John liked very much but severely doubted would prove useful in a fight.
John sighed. “I have a feeling you wouldn’t tell me anyway. So no, I don’t need to know everything. Just tell me the basics, and, I don’t know, leave a note or something if you plan on disappearing?”
Said detective gave an angry moan, and would probably have stayed where he was indefinitely if he hadn’t thought about what it would do to John to see him unmoving on the floor. So with his last vestige of patience, Sherlock wriggled and rolled his way back to the couch, ending by planting his face firmly on a seat cushion. Sitting on the cushion would be better for John’s peace of mind, but that was one step farther than Sherlock was capable of at the moment.
(See the end of the chapter for
“Hurry up, Johnny! You wouldn’t want me to get bored!” came from beyond the door.
With the simple touch of legs to feet, John was leaning against the outside of Sherlock’s box, making a patch of warmth for him to curl around or shun as he saw fit. A little action that spoke of someone waiting, someone who was with him in spirit now, and would be with him in truth when this spell passed. Someone who would be standing there to catch him as he staggered out of this personal hell, possibly with tea. And while Sherlock doubted it would make his stay in the box any shorter, it made it slightly more bearable.
“Lestrade was outside, so the others clearly weren’t his, even if the uniforms had been police. The only other person you know who could summon such a force is Mycroft, but Mycroft would never let you take the lead, he’s far too stubborn. So the clear answer is that Moriarty was correct in asserting that Mycroft was otherwise engaged. But he’s never been one to let alone so, in lieu of taking care of this whole business himself,” Sherlock waved a hand at the general situation, “He sent his most immediate inferior. Who would have hastened back to his side the moment the situation no longer required her attention.” There was a hint of pride in the detective’s eyes as he took in John’s somewhat amazed expression.
John rolled his eyes internally. Well, some more dangerous than others.
Sherlock gave a disgruntled shift, but didn’t pull his hands away. He raised his index finger and touched a letter. John spoke it aloud.
And there was nothing for it, a sulk there was to be. The microscope had been his last chance, his last hope at staving off the black mood that had been looming these past few days. All his life, Sherlock had lived in Schrodinger’s box. And at this moment, as at any moment when true boredom loomed, he knew there was nothing that could keep the vial of poison from spilling its contents. The detective could do nothing now but close his eyes and wait for the swirling gas of malaise to dissipate. With a pained expression, he settled to wait out his personal hell.
He didn’t doubt that he’d be able to undo the cuffs with one hand, even if it was shaking, or that he could completely free the hand in question without drawing attention to himself. The trouble was his ribs.
“No point,” interjected Anthea without looking up. “That ambulance wasn’t hired by any hospital in London. The corporation that hired it out has it down as being used by St. Bartholomew’s, but they don’t know anything about it.” The executive assistant was still typing away on her phone. “Relevant information is on Dr. Watson’s laptop.
“Let me talk to her.”
“As you have seen I know almost everything about you, but there are still questions it would benefit us both if you would answer. First: You do not want to be here. The money is better than what you’re used to, so it can only be a moral obligation. I am already ninety-eight percent sure that this is the case, but your answer will confirm it, and I’ll know if you lie. Are you or are you not morally opposed to Biopharmaceuticals Limited?
“Of course. At four in the morning?”
“Tomorrow I start the most intensive period of drug production,” stated the IP without intonation.
But if Moriarty had a camera trained on him, doubtless he also had a microphone.
The consulting detective was pulled out of his reverie by Moriarty, who had switched personalities again and had put himself nose to nose with the detective, barely contained rage evident in the mastermind’s face. No wonder it was so difficult to analyze this man; every time one got a handle on him, Moriarty became a different person. Like trying to read a kaleidoscope.
The doctor shrugged, resigned. “No idea. Talks through ultrasound machines, carries an umbrella, says he’s worried about you—”
There, John prodded her. “You’re sure it was salt?”
Somewhat dumbstruck, John walked out and made a left, counting the doors as he went.
John turned to Anthea, who shook her head. “Busy,” she responded to his unasked question as she continued to type. He didn’t push the matter, as it was about as useless to argue with her, he’d found, as it was to argue with her employer.
John fought against the repulsion in his gut. “You killed them? The whole cult?”
“Actually, I opened the door so you wouldn’t,” responded the doctor shortly. He checked over Moriarty’s shoulder to make sure no one else was on the street. Luckily, it was deserted.
John, a bit dumbstruck by the room’s dark-haired occupant, didn’t move a muscle. The man, probably the one the nurse had been complaining about, was certainly a striking character. Everything from his height to his skin tone to his hair cut was unusual, and most unusual of all was that he was somehow able to appear in control and impressive while wearing nothing but a hospital gown. Doctor Watson had spent enough time in hospitals to know that no one—absolutely no one—could look dignified wearing that generic cheap polyester. Except for this person, it seemed.
“Take you, for example,” Sherlock continued. “Every time you mention the job I’m on, you look around for cameras and speak in a stage whisper. Now, imagine you were watching yourself on those cameras you don’t see. You would see a man acting very suspiciously. While if you were watching me, you wouldn’t see any behaviors out of place.”
At that, Sherlock had felt himself smile.
So John had been forced to make another last-minute rescue, illegal gun blaring as he raced to save his oft-captured flatmate and more-than-friend.
Not again. Well, of course, again. That was sort of the point, The Great Game and all. Games aren’t over until someone wins. But Moriarty is still masterminding crimes, and Sherlock is still trying to stop him. So, by definition, the Game is still on.
It was nearly unbearable.
“Because Kenneth Stubbingwicke is an idiot!” the detective exploded, leaning way forward over the image on the screen. “I mean, an idiot compared to most people. Just look at his hair! It’s unlikely the man could’ve learned to tie his own shoes without a private tutor.”
“But I haven’t mentioned a figure.”
On the screen, Sherlock was attempting to hail a cab, one hand raised, when one of the passing taxis broke away from the traffic and full-out ploughed into the detective, drawing a little shriek from Mrs. Hudson.
All together, they were making progress. John had managed to black out entire areas of London where they were sure Sherlock wasn’t, as well as tentatively deciding that he was most probably still somewhere in the city. Although he couldn’t be completely certain about this, Anthea assured him that the comings and goings of London were of particular interest to Mycroft. Somehow, this was reassuring. But then another message from Anthea highlighted most likely spots for holding a hostage, and that undoubtedly useful data was information John didn’t want to wonder why Mycroft possessed.
Sherlock felt the concussive force of the blast from the kitchen, and it took him a fraction of a second to get from “Why is my microscope shaking?” to “JohnJohnJohnNoMustFindJohn!”  By which time, he had already shot off his stool and tripped half way down the now-half-decimated staircase to 221’s former front hall.
“Already on your laptop,” Anthea repeated, obviously distracted by whatever she was typing.
The Consulting Detective frowned slightly, a micropipette frozen in midair. “That still doesn’t explain why you’re here.”
“You’ll be living in here, of course. All the personal physicians live with their IPs, protocol you know. Now, you said no to implantation support. What about removal surgery?”
The icy silence that followed was broken, most unpredictably, by Mrs. Hudson.
As it turned out, John was correct. At about 11 pm, on the last night before Sherlock was scheduled to start his first round of shots, the IP called John over to where he was once again leaned over the doctor’s computer.
Just then, the bleeping sound of a received text message filled the apartment. John looked down at his phone, but it wasn’t the one responding. So, Sherlock had obviously left his cell back at the flat. John felt his shoulders relax even as he filled with exasperation, and started in the direction of the noise, digging through the permanent piles of notes that covered their dining room table until he found the phone in question.
As John's hand made contact with Sherlock’s ass, the wetness not only amplified the sensation but also the sound as well. Droplets were flung into the air surrounding the detective’s backside.
John’s forehead wrinkled at Sherlock’s refusal to budge but his frown was still more playful than not. “Fine. But I reserve the right to pull out of this if I can’t handle it.”
“Oh?” John questioned, as he moved the nozzle lower and placed it against Sherlock’s asshole. “Has my detective had enough for today?”
“Hands up against the glass. I don’t want you touching yourself while I get you clean.”
Doing as he was told, Sherlock sensed the shower nozzle being pulled back and a different sort of stream hit him in the face. Although voluntarily blinded, he could certainly smell what John was doing to him. His boyfriend was pissing on him. Pissing on his face! As greedy as the detective was for John's fluids, he hadn’t expected that he would do such a thing. But given what had just occurred between them in the main room, he supposed he shouldn’t have been totally surprised.
And with that final proclamation, he brought his hand up and brought it firmly down on Sherlock’s luscious arse.
” Excitement buzzed in his stomach at this realization and it made his dick spurt a bit of precum.
Sherlock was by no means a masochist. However, there was something about brute physical contact that made his eyes roll back in his head. It wasn’t the pain, it was the feeling of the pain subsiding. Almost as if the pain was melting away and took all of Sherlock’s stress and tension with it.
“Only if you promise to join me,” Sherlock growled, baring his teeth.
“That’s right. Say my name, bitch!”
John cried in pleasure, “You better get something in my arse, Sherlock, and get it in there now.”
Most of the time, when it came to men, Sherlock would use them and lose them. But not John. No, this one was a keeper. The two of them had gotten into all sorts of unusual, yet thrilling situations together. And it surprised him still, just how much his current lover continued to fill him with wonder and excitement. Not that he had a way of a conveying that to John; Sherlock’s communication skills in matters of the heart tended to be lacking.
However, the pair’s communication skills in matters of sex were very well developed indeed. And as John nestled his cheek against Sherlock’s athletic short-clad thigh, the doctor’s mind wandered down that well-trod path of intimacy. Creeping his hand along the exposed skin, the soft hairs of Sherlock’s leg tickled at his wrist.
It turned him on to think about carrying around physical markings indicative of his lover’s passion. A sideways glance over his shoulder at the mirror hanging above the bathroom sink afforded him only the briefest glimpse before John slid the frosted glass panel of the shower stall door open and pulled Sherlock in with him.
Even if his boyfriend did tear his ass, it would be okay, Sherlock tried to convince himself. He would heal.
Thanks for reading. Please leave a comment if you are so inclined.
,” Sherlock moaned in response.
John mistook the exclamation for pleasure and he thrust even harder.
“With all that cum in you,” John added in a dirty whisper, “you’d really earn the title of Cum Dump.”
,” Sherlock groaned. The soap was stinging so much he wouldn’t be able to think at all soon.
Metal grated softly against metal as John slid the door shut behind them.
Huffing softly, the doctor gently pushed him down in front of him. A position Sherlock was more than happy to be in since it gave him easier access to John's dick. Not skipping a beat, he eagerly sought the flaccid, yet still delicious, cock with his mouth.
“How much more could you take?”
“You want more? Do you, you fucking whore?”
“Promise?”
“I… uh…” Sherlock mumbled, his mind not cooperating or thinking straight as he basked under so much intimate attention.
The detective also speculated what it was that had kept John at home all day and not by his side.
“I going to fucking cum in your arse.”
Leaving a trail of clothes behind them, Sherlock and John were both naked by the time they made it to the washroom. They were both so lust-drunk at the moment that they actually reached their destination was a miracle in and of itself. Blindly seeking what they both craved, their mouths barely parted from each other ever since John had pulled his detective up off the floor.
“No, I—“
Taking just a moment to grab some nearby lube, Sherlock covered both John’s arsehole and his fingers before plunging his middle finger into his heat and felt John’s muscles tighten around it.
“Bitch, don’t you dare think about humping me like some damn dog. You hear me?”
That was it. Sherlock had to call it quits. He couldn’t take anymore.
“You watch that Hannibal programme all the time.”
If John kept pounding him so hard Sherlock feared he might see that frothy soap mixture turn pink with blood soon.
Whatever pheromones he was giving off must’ve been affecting John as well because the doctor wasn’t slowing down. If anything, it only spurred him on to continue his administrations.
“Fuck!”
“Well, I’m no bitch,” John continued. “You are.”
It had been a tumultuous affair, the beginning of their relationship. Sherlock had never meant to pursue a romantic connection with anyone, let alone a man, but the instant connection he had felt to the military doctor had been, in a word, insatiable. It had taken a giant’s share of self-control to wait until they had got to know each other for longer than a fortnight to make his move.
“Bitch, you’d be the one to know,” John whispered, a smile playing across his lips.
“Well? I asked you a question, bitch. Aren’t you going to answer?”
Shrugging, the detective lay in John's arms as he watched the water spurting from the discarded shower head on the stall floor. “I should have stopped you earlier. Not tried to endure it for so long.”
Bending down to help the detective get his shoes off so he could remove his now damp underwear and slacks, John replied, “I’d like nothing better.”
“Hurts, doesn’t it? You like pain, you sick cunt.”
“Please, sir,” the detective asked his boyfriend, desperate to hear what dirty things the doctor had to call him, “tell me what I am?”
“Nasty piece of gutter trash whore fucking cum dump cunt.”
Lost in the afterglow of his orgasm, John let his fingers slipped up to scratch lightly at Sherlock’s curly mane.“
” Sherlock thought, “
All he could think about was the fact he was going to cum… he was… going...going to.. he was…
Sherlock wonders when John would stop and break out the lube. In the heat of the moment, he hadn’t noticed if John had stocked any in the shower. Then, feeling the blunt head of John's cock at his back entrance, surely his boyfriend knew that soap did not make a good substitute for lubricant. Granted, it was fine to use for a bit of fingering but anything beyond that would sting.
Seriously, this dirty talk was making Sherlock drool. That plus the ebb and flow of pain was making him delirious.
“Oh,” Sherlock exclaimed bringing his hand to the liquid and smearing it down lover’s chest, rubbing his cum on John’s nipples and loving the hungry way the doctor’s blue eyes followed his hand.
With his hair a mess, the blanket thrown to the side, and him sitting bare arse naked on the couch, Sherlock was the stuff wet dreams were made of. Pulling at his shirt, Sherlock got it off quickly. John kicked out of his comfy joggers as well. He was commando underneath and Sherlock had just a second to admire John’s naked body before the latter bent back down to resume fellating his dick.
Rubbing the growing member, John was ever so pleased to feel the warm flesh between his fingers fill with blood. His thumb circled the end of Sherlock’s dick and was instantly wet, the velvet head of his cock leaking a drop of pre-cum.
“You’d like that, wouldn’t you? You like having things in your arse, don’t you bitch?” John asked as he began to slowly piston his hips in the small space of the shower stall. In the slickness of the shower, he gripped Sherlock’s hips with both hands for leverage and stability.
“That’s right, my slutty cock whore. You’re mine.”
“You know, I was wrong before. Your heartbeat isn’t the sweetest thing I’ve ever heard,” Sherlock admitted. When he saw John’s questioning expression as he leaned in to kiss him, he softly whispered, “I love you too.”
Tugging at the hem of the slacks, John soon had both them and the plaid underpants Sherlock was wearing bunched up around his boyfriend’s knees.
“I guess that will do for now. But just so it’s clear, we’re going to have to put some work in on your manners,” John growled a bit himself in reply as he pushed another slippery finger into the detective’s ass.
Bruises…
“Someone has gotten his boy all messy,” John said. “Don’t you think respectful lovers should clean up their messes?”
,” he told himself, “
Shivering slightly, Sherlock shook the water from his eyes as he leaned down to nibble lightly at the nape of John's neck.
“Hey, now. These are my favourite!” Sherlock’s voice rumbled above the blanket but his voice certainly didn’t sound angry.
Ever cognizant of his own inexperience, he had been very specific about consent and his ability to utilize safewords during any role-play scenes. Going with the basic green, yellow, and red system, Sherlock knew he could call out that three-letter word at any moment and the scene would immediately end. Additionally, he knew he could easily overpower the doctor at any moment.
“You have been a very naughty detective,” John declared as he smoothed his hand over his boyfriend’s plump arse cheeks. “Gone all day. Leaving me waiting and pining over you like some bitch.”
“But,” John continued, “lucky for you I’m in a good mood. So good a mood that I don’t mind telling you what a wanton slut you are.”
Sherlock was a firm believer in staying well hydrated, so the liquid dripping from between his legs was clear and relatively odourless. Still, the total humiliation he was feeling was beyond anything he could express in words. And the depravity of the situation was only feeding into his all-consuming animalistic desire for more.
“John!” Sherlock finally yelled, the pain pushing him past his breaking point.
“Yes.”
One of Sherlock’s big hands made its way under the covers to gently massage John’s scalp. His fingers toyed with the doctor’s hair in a way that was designed to comfort. John peeped up through a gap in the blanket, studying Sherlock as he stared intently at the TV.
Sherlock knew how much the doctor loved dirty talk but was a little unsure if he was in the mood for it. But the way John raised his hips to meet the detective’s hand told him he was on the right path.
The soap had moved beyond a tickle and was starting to sting at this point. Sherlock was tempted to pull away. He could deal with pain as long as it dissipated but, unlike his earlier spanking, this wasn’t dissipating. If anything, it was increasing along with John’s fervour. Still, the sensation of a cock sliding over his prostate was so potent and his dick didn’t seem to have a problem with the discomfort. It was just as hard as ever as it bounced in time with his boyfriend’s thrusts.
“You know, I think hearing the kick of your heart after you come is the sweetest music I’ve ever heard,” Sherlock rumbled, voice rough.
“Holy Hell!” Sherlock gasped, knowing he wouldn’t last long if John kept this up.
“Don’t be foolish, Doctor Watson. Of course, I want more.”
“Seriously?” Sherlock couldn’t help but grin at how delicate his fierce boy could be, despite having been a soldier. And though he would never admit to it, it made his cock throb when he got to play ‘protector’ for his doctor.
“Yes, sir.”
John was now working on his back and drawing lazy lines along the sinewy well-defined muscles there.
,” the detective thought, “
“You know what you are, don’t you?” John asked.
“Oh!” the doctor exclaimed as he realized what was happening. “My dirty boy is wetting himself. So naughty!”
“No! You can’t make me. I won’t do it.”
Straining against the pain of the burning, Sherlock gritted his teeth so hard the sinews in his neck were probably bulging. Fortunately, under John's care, the sting slowly faded and soon he could breathe again. Surprised at the level of pain his boyfriend had caused was nothing compared to the euphoric feeling of it dissipating. And the fact that John was treating him in such a kind and cherished fashion made it exponentially better.
It always amazed Sherlock how wide his lover’s blue eyes could get and just how innocent he could look. He knew all too well how far from innocent John really was. Consequently, the detective wasn’t about to relent.
“Did you not hear me, bitch!” John snarled. “I said come here.”
“I’m not mad,” Sherlock sighed as he allowed John to pull him into a loving embrace. “No harm, no foul.”
“Sherlock,” John's voice was full of concern as he crouched next to his boyfriend, “I’m so sorry. I didn’t realize. What’s wrong?”
He was done being submissive for the evening.
“Good,” John chuckled as he gently rubbed the now reddened cheeks.
Had he not been so horny, he would’ve found the situation comical. Right now though, fumbling underneath the blanket was only irritating him. Unable to deal with his frustration any longer, in his cock-hunger, he pulled on Sherlock’s shorts so forcefully that he heard the tell-tale sound of stitches popping.
Sherlock chuckled, pulling John down on his lap. Nuzzling the soft curve of his neck, he soothed, “Calm down sweetheart, it’s just a film.”
At this, John’s arse clamped down so hard on his fingers, Sherlock thought he might lose circulation. Still, he kept rubbing his cock and twitching his fingers inside the doctor as John rode wave after wave of his orgasm. Few things ever struck him as beautiful as watching John come and his fierce dark eyes drank in every second of it.
“That’s how animals mark their territory, isn’t it, Sherlock? This way everyone knows that you’re my bitch. I own you.”
As communicating verbally during intimate acts had never been his strong suit, Sherlock was completely past words at the moment. Still, the idea of John stopping, if he didn’t answer, was unbearable. Consequently, somehow he managed to eke out a mumbled response.
“Let’s get you clean,” John said as he turned the squeaky knob of the facet, catching them both in a cascade of frigid drops before the shower had warmed up.
“No.” John voice was laden with contrition.“I should’ve been paying better attention to your reactions. It’s my fault. I just got caught up in the scene and let it go too far.”
“I SAID NOW!”
A low growl rumbled in the detective’s throat at being denied what he wanted, but he did not verbally protest as John began to rinse him off with the nozzle. The water was warm now and Sherlock basked in the glorious feeling of massaging pressure as his boyfriend ran his fingers behind the streaming jets of water hitting his skin and scalp. If his eyes weren’t already closed, he’d be rolling them backwards in bliss.
“Well then…” John proclaimed as he placed the showerhead back in its holder, “Let’s see if we can finish getting you cleaned up and maybe we can play some more. I think I’m about ready for another round anyway.”
Sherlock leaned in and kissed him hard before pulling away, his own grin wide. “Yeah… I do know. You’d fuck anything with a big dick because all you want is to get your arse stretched and your belly full of cum. That’s what you want, isn’t it? A belly full of cum? You want to be bred like a bitch in heat.”
“The soap,” Sherlock panted, “it burns.”
Rather than to say anything aloud, Sherlock simply smirked and gave a small shrug.
“Hannibal’s not scary!” John insisted, clearly feeling that his favourite television series had just been maligned.
He definitely had not had enough. He desperately wanted more.
John's words were a clear contradiction to the erection he sported, made extremely evident as he stood from his chair to tower over Sherlock. It only took him a second to free his cock before he began to pump his shaft.
“Up,” John ordered.
Leaning over, the detective did his best to get in a position that best suited the situation. It was an odd position to be in, that was for sure. His knees bumped into the legs of the chair and his feet were left awkwardly balancing the remaining weight on the toes of his shoes. His belly rested on John'ss thighs which caused his upper torso to be angled slightly downward as he rested his hands on the hard wooden floor beneath him. Blood would’ve rushed to his head if it hadn’t already been allocated to his dick.
“Best things never do,” Sherlock grinned as he pulled his boyfriend into a kiss.
He massaged the nape of John’s neck with strong fingers. “Babe, you’ll be fine. Look, climb under the blanket and if you get scared, you can hide underneath.”
“Yes, sir what?”
“Fuck!” he hissed. “Yes, sir I’m a dirty boy… P-please, clean out my hole.”
Sherlock had been holding out for too long and that last bit from John was enough to send him right over the edge. His head thrown back and resting on his boyfriend’s shoulder, his neck elongated and Adam’s apple bobbing as his breathing momentarily faltered.
Sherlock came right as John came up to catch his breath. His cum hit his underneath John’s chin and dribbled down his throat.
Sherlock’s eyes flashed in an instant from sexy to serious.
Truth be told, Sherlock was distracted by John's fingers which were now running along his crack and teasing the sensitive nerves around his back passageway. This was until another slap brought him back to his senses.
That tone made Sherlock’s dick throb and he knew he was a goner. Dropping his keys to the floor, he quickly closed the gap between him and the doctor. All he wanted to do was kiss those soft lips and slide his tongue between them.
Basking in the glow of orgasmic bliss, Sherlock was practically floating. However, he did have the space of mind to add with a grin, “Sure. As long as we keep a bottle of silicone-based lube on hand.”
“Mmmm? Tell me,” the detective returned.
Sherlock suppressed a smile as he leaned into the kiss and replied, “I love you too.”
“John?” Sherlock stiffened slightly and his tone took on a bit of reprimand. “What are you doing?”
“Come,” John noted pulling away, “let’s get you out of those clothes and in the shower.”
“Don’t,” Sherlock breathed. “Stop.”
Moving off of the couch, Sherlock manoeuvred them both to the floor and laid John down on the discarded blanket. Bending his head over John’s chest, he licked up his own spent seed. Paying special attention to the doctor’s nipples, he tugged them gently before licking at the tips of the erect buds.
“You’re a whore, you know that bitch, don’t you? A fucking cock sucking whore.”
John let himself be pulled down onto the couch. Snuggling up next to Sherlock’s side and giving him a peck on the cheek in return, the doctor grabbed the freshly-washed blanket from the arm of the couch and threw it over the pair of them.
A small jet of liquid snuck its way down and out of Sherlock’s urethra.
“Fuck you’re sloppy,” Sherlock said as he added another finger to the first as he finger fucked John’s arse. “Such a dirty, dirty slut. I bet you’d fuck any guy with a cute face you saw, regardless of whether or not it was a good idea. Wouldn’t you, slut?”
His aggressive response came off as more stern than he had intended it to but, then again, he’d never met a man who loved to be called a ‘bitch’ as much as his Sherlock. Still, John felt something in his chest ease when Sherlock didn’t comment further and instead relaxed back into the couch.
The heat from the shower steamed up the frosted glass and as he placed his hands flat on the smooth panel, lines of condensed moisture dribbled down its walls.
The whole shower experience had been wonderful so far but it would be even better if his boyfriend would let him have a turn receiving a different sort of stimulation. John might’ve cum already but he hadn’t. Sherlock’s hard cock throbbed and yet he dared not touch it without permission; since he wasn’t sure, with the ending of the golden shower, if John was done playing the dom.
“Because you belong to me. Others can play all they want but I am yours and you are mine.”
Finally, when he was finished, Sherlock sprawled next to John and drew him close, wrapping them both up in the no longer pristine blanket. Placing a kiss on his forehead, Sherlock then lay his head on his boyfriend’s chest and listened to his still quickly beating heart.
Damn it. He wanted that bitch dick in his mouth but Sherlock’s bloody shorts were still in the way.
“Fuck!” Sherlock cried as whatever resistance he had left in him fled his body and he let his bladder loose. The sheer feeling of relief was practically euphoric and he felt all his bones go to jelly as he went as limp as a rag doll.
“Bend over my lap.”
“Yessir,” came Sherlock’s reply as he more than willingly complied with the directive.
Knowing he wanted cock but that his was now temporarily out of commission, he settled for the next best thing, his fingers. Running his hand up between John’s legs, Sherlock loved how aroused his boyfriend already was and that there was no need to warm him up.
The muffled sounds of screams bothered John and he covered his ears but apparently, it was still not enough to prevent him from imagining the horrors on the screen. Curling up, he lay under the blanket and rested his head on Sherlock’s thigh.
“Right . . .”
That was all either of them ever said about it.
Withholding an irritated sigh, Sherlock scanned the article quickly, recalling the details. “This was a couple of years ago now. A pattern of suicides, linked: all the victims took the same poison, all self-administered, all were found alone . . .”
“Sure,” said Sherlock, clearing a spot on the table and sitting himself at it.
Sherlock, of course, asked most of the questions while Lestrade took notes, and he was just as efficient and detached as the Sherlock John had always known, to the point where he had to intercede with a warning tone (“
Apparently, according to his sources, which all read to him like science fiction, any sex could have intercourse with any other sex, but for the purposes of reproduction, only certain pairings yielded offspring. There was even a handy chart:
“Uh . . .  Somewhere in the middle. By a pond. I see a bridge, and … Yeah, shit, they’re definitely staring at me.”
“That’ll teach you not to swallow prematurely,” said Sherlock, smirking, just as Mrs. Hudson said, “Yes, drink it all down.”
“Here,” said Sherlock. “The exact center.”
And she ushered him toward the door; behind him, the next Omega was stepping up to her station, and he heard her begin to answer all the same questions, unabashed.
“One day, this woman wakes up in her own bed but in strange linens she’s never seen before. She goes to work and someone else is in her cubicle. But it’s not that she doesn’t work for that company anymore—she’s just listed in a different department, working under a supervisor she doesn’t even know. Much of her life is still the same—family, friends, house, car—but there are enough little things, important things, that are different, and they’re never put right again. She wrote a blog about it. It’s in Spanish, but I can give you the link. She’s not the only one. These things pop up all over the place, easier to document and share now that we have the Internet. But it’s been happening for years, decades, centuries even. You know about Tokyo 1954?”
John blinked, his face registering offense. “Do you want me to paint you a picture? With my teeth. With my fists. I broke their sodding bones, that’s how!”
“Sorry! Sorry!” he muttered, scrambling to find his feet while simultaneously cupping himself like a little boy who needed to use the loo, as if he could possibly hide his arousal. “I wasn’t expecting . . . That is, I didn’t know it would . . . feel . . . like this.”
, in this world. But even after all the other John had done, the doctors had still treated him like a child. Would Sherlock?
. He’s okay. John is
“Tell me.”
, exactly. It still felt great. But it would take some getting used to. The point was, he and Sherlock had been connecting (that is, heh, more than just physically) in a way that hadn’t in months. And in that way, it was . . . perfect.
The cabbie slammed on the brake, screeching to a halt, and Sherlock was out the door. John was halfway out himself, planning to run after him, when the cabbie said, “Oi! That’s twelve pounds fifty, that is!”
“I still don’t understand. They’re not even pack.”
“I’ll fill you in on the way,” said Sherlock. “But she’s a nobody, really. Just one of the unlucky unbonded. Name of Molly Hooper.”
So he made a beeline for the first pub he spotted. But when he approached the door, the bouncer stood in his path and put a hand out to stop him. He sniffed. John sniffed back. Something instinctual in him identified the man immediately as an Alpha. It was terribly strange knowledge.
They spent the next half hour sweeping away broken mirror shards, hoovering the rugs, and disposing of the destruction. “Don’t tell Mrs. Hudson,” Sherlock said. “We’ll replace it, and she won’t even notice.”
But when John read the confession that had been intended to establish greater rapport and reinforce their mutual trust, when his eyes landed on the final word, he visibly flinched. His whole body fell back a step, as though he had been physically jolted, and his eyes went wide with what John could only describe as dismay.
“You’ve a bond-mate. Not every Omega has that. Best not take him for granted, eh?”
“And you can just . . . inject it? No frills, no fuss?”
Sherlock returned hungrily to his neck. In between kisses and latherings, he said, “No”—lick—“why should it”—suck—“bother”—kiss—“me?”
“Sherlock, I just have to say, what you and John did for her . . . It means more to her than you may ever fully appreciate. More than I can appreciate.”
“What do you mean? You don’t mean . . . we’re not going to . . . kill the detective?”
“Sherlock! I—! This was—! You
“It’s terribly dry, I assure you. Not like your science fiction stories.”
what this was. I was shot! Why would you think—? What business is it of—? How did you—?”
He told Sherlock the story of his father, what it had been like being raised by a single parent with an alcohol addiction and a short temper, how Harry had escaped first, but how John had to join the RAMC to get away from him, and when he died, John hadn’t even come home for the funeral. He confirmed many of Sherlock’s deductions about broken fingers and burns and cuts, but mentioned other abuses that had long since faded. Faded from his body anyway. His mind was a different matter entirely. And he told about one of the more humiliating of scars—a pattern of circles on his right buttock from his own cleats, which his father had stolen and fashioned into weapons.
John shrugged, a tortured smile on his face. “It is what it is, yeah? Don’t worry about it.”
John liked Molly, and although he was still getting to know her, he felt like they shared a real connection. Much of that, of course, was owing to whatever had happened between her and the other John. He regretted that he himself was not privy to those apparently friendly, confidential conversations, and he would probably never find out. He’d picked up a few clues, but he couldn’t ask her outright. So he just had to build on what he knew of the history they shared and what they were now building together. But one thing he had come to understand was that he, John, was in a large way responsible for her positive outlook, despite the horrible things that had happened to her.
“You lost in there again?”
In the past
you, sir, come into
Quite of its own accord, one of Sherlock’s legs wrapped around John’s body and pulled him nearer to press their two bodies together. The answer to heaviness was more weight, of course, of course, and John positively sank into him. Sherlock gasped and pulled John’s breath inside of him. John shuddered and moaned.
“We have a plan.”
“My John?” Sherlock asked, a slight tremble in his voice, like he didn’t dare to hope.
It wasn’t revulsion. It was a different kind of pain.
“Oh yeah! Of course. He . . .” John scrambled for something believable but vague. Maybe even if Sherlock
The liberty in touching his arm, the offer to get drinks, the display of concern and the look of promise on his face that he could alleviate whatever ailed him . . . Was this man trying to pick him up? Was the fact of his failing bond
Gritting his teeth, John slapped his ID on the counter. Really? He was being carded? Did he look fifteen?
He nodded once, stiffly. “That’s right.”
“Then why did he lie to me?”
, to trying to get into a nightclub on his own, to trying to purchase alcohol, to being accosted on the bus. Mycroft had shown Sherlock
Sherlock? He didn’t know him at all.
she could do about that? Outrage!
“I mean, if you don’t have resilient enough springs. Think about it. It’s the equivalent of two full-grown men jumping up and down on the box springs for three days, non-stop. It’s bound to grind and tear, and that’s not to mention the staining, no matter how often you change the sheets—”
.” John tugged his shirt back into place, his face suddenly red with anger.
His body begged for a relief he didn’t know how to give it; it craved something he couldn’t name. All he really knew was that all he wanted was to lie down, and he wasn’t about to do that in Sherlock’s bedroom. He returned shakily to the sitting room and lay down on the couch. There, he fanned his face and tried to quell the cramps. That’s when he received a text.
“Sherlock is perfectly safe. It’s
Sherlock stood stunned, mute,
“No need, no need. I told you before, it’s
“If our pack was larger, for instance, which it’s not. Or if he was a pup, which none of them are. Or if, in the course of fighting, he gets injured and doesn’t wish to suffer more harm. He doesn’t need a reason. He surrenders, and the fight is over. For him. He keeps his testicles, but they’re rendered worthless. The other pack members may continue to fight.”
“See that he gets well again, eh? I want to hear the whole story from his own lips.”
I mean, I knew you two were good mates, but

“I . . . should have . . . I’m sorry. You were . . . right. I should have, that is, if I had only . . .”
“Just her name,” he lied. “And given her reputation, I reckon she’s very good at what she does.”
He leaned forward, offered John a consolatory pat on the knee, said, “Glad we cleared that up,” and rose to his feet. He had work to do, after all, and the day was already waning. Kitchen first, for a quick breakfast and a strong coffee, then—
“Don’t matter, does it? I get caught selling to an Omega, next thing I know, that Omega ends up in hospital or worse, and who do the police come after? Me, that’s who. Suddenly, they're calling me an enabler.”
Time stood still. John looked at Sherlock. Sherlock looked at Bob Geraets. Bob Geraets looked and John, holding high the murder weapon.
“He’s dangerous!” To Sherlock, she returned a growl of her own. “I’m saving him, Mr. Holmes. From
“Synchronicity, John, that’s what Dr. Stapleton said.”
His mouth snapped shut, and he waited for an answer.
Sherlock shrugged and smirked. “Because . . . why not?”
They winked at him, patted him on the head, and left him to himself and a bowl of corn flakes.
The sleep fled from Sherlock’s eyes, like light punching through a fog. He twisted to the mirror. But despite his sudden alert state, he whispered, “Where?”
“Don’t say that.” He threaded his hands through Sherlock’s hair, damp with sweat. “I’m not going anywhere. Neither are you. We need each other, Sherlock. We’ve come through hell to find one another, and I’ll fight hell itself to keep us right here, like this.”
And he turned back to ascend the steps, and meet himself on the other side of the glass.
. Just Holmes. The bloom of euphoria at the prospect of seeing Sherlock again began to wilt, and the weeds of doubt began to choke. He frowned, stepped inside, and closed the door behind him. There, he steeled himself.
“You wanker! You
Lightning. Pure energy. So what just happened? The trains keep rolling, like nothing at all happened, but they’ve actually been displaced. Each is in the other’s universe. Train A is riding Train B’s tracks.” She sat back, pleased with her illustrative example. “It’s quite fascinating mathematics, believe me.”
John didn’t let him help wrap the bandage, or help him secure plastic around his hand to protect it from water, or help him undress for the shower. But one thing John couldn’t—
“Your deduction skills are as sharp as ever, John.”
Then again, the other scars had been with him for a very long time. He supposed, with a sigh of resignation, that no matter his stage in life, he had always walked around in a marred body. One way or another, in this time or that, in any examination of any sort, he couldn’t keep buried the truth of his ugly past—his body tattled on him at every angle. But maybe Sherlock wouldn’t dig too deep. And if he did suspect, hopefully he wouldn’t be react. John didn’t know which was worse: repulsion, or pity. If either was the case, Sherlock would end the examination. And, in his most honest skin, John didn’t want that, either.
“Incredible. That was . . . amazing to behold.”
For a moment, Sherlock was completely thrown off his game, but then Mr. Jacobs recalled him to his purpose.
John snorted. “Your first theory is that I’m a spy.”
He laughed. “Don’t worry. They’re in for a world of hurt. From both of us.”
“Where’s Sher—?”
So though it made him nauseous, and strangely itchy and self-conscious, he knew what he had to do—
John’s smile didn’t have time to linger before they were locked together again, knees and groins and stomachs and mouths, and the lazy, painstaking kisses were gone. The slow exploration was over. Sherlock wanted John, and he wanted him badly. His desire was the sum total of months, more accurately
Sherlock groaned involuntarily, no longer unconscious, not quiet awake. Mrs. Hudson’s ascending steps vibrated in his hear. Quite literally, too, as his ear was pressed into the floorboards beneath the sitting room table. Slowly, his body was coming online, and he blinked, but even with eyes wide open, he saw nothing.
“When’s his next heat?”
John knew that tone, and his breath hitched a little. It was the tone Sherlock used when he was onto something, but he hadn’t quite arrived, and all he needed to do was talk it through, work it out, test it against the sounding board, and he could untangle any knot.
, and the feeling of surprise, as no Alpha had ever asked permission before taking what they wanted from him, whether it was an adjoining seat or possession of his body, just as they wanted it, during his most vulnerable hours. The gesture was small, almost insignificant. But it was the first time he could name when he felt respected by an Alpha, and he knew that if he said no, the Alpha would acquiesce, move away, and leave him be. He had never met one like that. So he said yes. And Sherlock sat.
Mike frowned. “You’re talking about protecting Omegas. The measures you’ve described do protect them, and, on the whole, are very effective.”
“Hold on, John, hold on,” Sherlock panted, kicking for the north banks.
Heart pounding like a kettle drum in his chest, Sherlock went to stand by the window. He needed to calm down if he was going to do this right and not choke.
Dr. Stapleton raised her eyebrows skeptically, then nodded condescendingly. “As you wish.”
Stunned silence followed. And while John’s chest rose and fell with infuriated breaths, Sherlock, who felt stunned to paralysis, saw Anthea out of the corner of his eye rising from her unobtrusive place on the end of the couch where she had been sitting quietly the whole time, knees pressed together, hands folded in her lap, as noticeable as furniture. But at John’s words, she swiftly found her feet as if obeying his command.
Sherlock withheld a sigh and forestalled an eye roll—he looked
. He had said
Having lost his appetite, John set the cornflakes aside to get milk-soggy and reached for the remote to see what all the hubbub was about. He thought he might have to do some searching, but he didn’t even have to change the channel. Because there he was, right up there on the screen, cameras zoomed in on the same face he saw every time he looked into a mirror, only this time, the expression was hardened, and the eyes were sharp with anger. John Watson had just walked into a dog-pen.
And then, on the third day, while John was flipping channels, trying unsuccessfully to find his favorite program,
Sherlock turned off the bathroom light and came into the room to find John petulant and glaring skyward.
Blinking in confusion, John said, “No, I couldn’t, I …”
What he did know was that, although they had agreed to forget the whole thing and continue on as they were, John was still suffering from deep embarrassment and struggling to return to what had only recently been their own brand of normalcy. That was clear enough, when he made no sign of joining Sherlock on this case until explicitly invited. It had been months and months since Sherlock had had to invite him. As far as he was concerned, unless John was at work, they were a package deal.
him trying to purchase two bottles of whiskey! You tell me, Sherlock, why else does an Omega try to drink?”
great, and the moment one little thing goes wrong, you think the sky is falling. It’s just like when you came back from Afghanistan. I mean, you were
“Raise.” She threw in two more chips. “Make-up sex?”
The Alphas stayed with her for hours, until the flatmates were heard readying for bed, finishing up in the bathroom, and retreating to their own rooms. When all was quiet, they slipped out of her bedroom, down the darkened hallway, and right out the front door. By then, she could already feel the toxins burning in her system. She had dropped her bag with her phone in it by the door. Because of the severity of the pain, she couldn’t reach it to call for help. All she could do was cry, and in time, one of her flatmates heard her and came inquiring. It was she who called for the ambulance. She was rushed to Omega Emergency, drained, and given a cocktail of neutralizing hormones; but her body was still fighting the bond.
“Whyever not?”
, thought John,
“You want me,” John gasped between kisses. “Today. Right now.”
“All the papers agree,” said John. “Andrew West killed himself by stepping into the path of an oncoming train. He also happened to be involved in a top-secret missile defense project. Any reason the truth didn’t come out that he was actually murdered?”
“Not like Ms. Hooper. Nothing like that, thank God. But he told me about Service Alphas who . . .”
“Go on,” said Sherlock, resigned. He looked less hopeful than when he had first stepped into the room, as if deciding that this was not a useful course to pursue.
. John Watson is the very last person on earth you need to hide from.”
“No. I mean . . .” John’s eyes challenged him, even as his jaw quivered. “Stop holding back.”
“Oh, you
John choked.
“Yes. I’m glad they did.”
“What’s this?”
“Nonsense, John, that’s
“If Lestrade says he needs me, he needs me,” said Sherlock, “a thing you have born witness to time and time again. Maybe one of these days you’ll figure it out, Sally.”
“Look! There was no knotting! Okay? You’re asking me if I was

With a frown, Mike leaned forward and said in low voice, as if they were sharing a secret, “You’re bonded, yes?”
“Whatever helps,” said Sherlock, distractedly.
a stranger to you. I’m not your Sherlock, and you’re not my . . .”
He swallowed. “I don’t know,” he said.
Sherlock knew what Mycroft thought—he hadn’t said it out loud yet, but Sherlock knew—and he refused to believe it. Besides, as his brother should have known, that theory did not account for
“Don’t get any funny ideas,” said Dr. Stapleton. Her words were admonitory, but her tone teased.
“What? What is that supposed to mean?”
“I let him borrow my phone.”
“Right . . . So how do we do
Sherlock climaxed. And in that moment of purest ecstasy, as he tried to cope with wave after wave of physical pleasure and emotional joy, he bit down hard into John’s neck.
. “I’m pretty sure I’ll have a front-row seat there, sis.”
Sherlock snorted unsympathetically. “She may have been bitty, John, but not exactly a subject worthy of your pity. Let’s not forget: she killed a woman, and was disposing of the corpse down the sink piece by piece.”
John nodded and made a gesture John read as
“You should keep working,” said John as they made a beeline for the road to hail a taxi. “It’ll be a few hours.” He winced as another pang shot through his gut, but he kept walking.
“Fine.”
“Or not do? I don’t want to get in the way.”
“Wouldn’t dream of missing it,” said Lestrade.
It was only a matter of time (minutes, hours if they were lucky) before they were discovered. If the cops hadn’t tracked Sherlock to Exeter, an explosion in Chelmsford in the Stapleton Estate was bound to draw attention. They would be apprehended, for sure: Sherlock for his escape and officer assault, and John alongside him for the murders of Dr. Stapleton and her assistant Byron. With the survivors as the only witnesses and accusers, it would take a while to sort out the facts and determine Sherlock had not been lying, but protecting his Omega. After all, Omega protection laws outweighed some of the severest of crimes.
“It was
“She doesn’t have a pack. That’s what she said.”
“The point is to move the consciousness from one state to another, isn’t it? Besides natural waking, what pulls you out of a dream? What forces you to return? A shock, a jolt, a sort of trauma. One must be forcibly shaken out of one reality to return to the other, and certainly you can already see the problem here, the paradox, the impossibility of such a thing working.”
“Yes, goodnight,” said Sherlock absently, staring at his wall.
John’s head came up sharply. “That’s not what I said. God, Sherlock, can we just not—”
She laughed, but it struck John’s ear as somewhat fabricated. “So are you ready for things to settle down again? Return to normal?”
Alongside the prominent veins were the tell-tale track marks of a former drug addict, round scars, now very faint, but unmistakable all the same. Watching Sherlock’s face for any objection, John reached for his arms with two gentle hands and drew him one step nearer for closer inspection. That was when he realized what was happening: Sherlock was welcoming an inspection of his
at my Omega. Doubt I can do it? Go on, then.
“What?”
“Oh. Well, um. It’s been a little crazy, actually. Letters have been arriving in buckets, I’ve had to turn off my phone, I keep getting stopped in the street, getting invitations to interview, all of that. I can hardly find time to breathe, let alone take it all in. People are pretty excited about it.”
“All right . . .”
And that was it. Sherlock was out like a lamp within minutes, without so much as a goodnight, or sweet dreams, or any kind of touch—apologetic or otherwise—at all.
“One last chance,” John said.
Upon reading this, the other John’s face went steely with resolve. He nodded sharply.
She meant the bruising.
Three large Alphas. Sherlock still could barely believe his eyes. All logic and historical precedent dictated that John, an Omega-Y, should have been left behind in that alley, barely able to move. After all, he had been selected, hunted, and attacked, wolves going after a deer. There was no way he should have walked away from that.

, John had said.
“Defending your own, you mean.”
It was the word that distracted him from the shouting and physical assault. One of his heats? And
Sherlock and John stared in horror at her madness. She was flinging fire in every direction, and that’s when John remembered the Bunsen burner. He’d twisted the nozzle, left it on. It was leaking like a faucet.
compelling. For instance, there’s a faction of us
His mind was roiling with a thousand questions and competing for space against a hundred different plans of escape. He knew three things with absolute certainty:
“There it is,” said Sherlock. “Three in a row, straight through the center.”
For the next few minutes, he conducted Google searches (“How to safely skip your heat” and “Can one go into heat if unconscious?” and then, a little more desperately, “What if I don’t want to be an Omega anymore?”). His searches pulled up nothing.
Visiting hours began at ten o’clock, and John expected to see Sherlock at ten sharp, to check him out so they could go home. But fifteen minutes passed, and no Sherlock. Meanwhile, his doctors informed him that although he was recovering nicely, they weren’t ready to release him. He argued with them, but not surprisingly, they barely listened. He wondered if he might have more luck if he sicked Sherlock onto them—but by eleven o’clock, still no Sherlock.
“Go on,” he said, calmly.
“Where’s John?” he asked the moment he had use of his mouth again. They set water before him, but he ignored it. “I want to talk to him.”
And with that, he gripped the hook and heaved, and when he did, the reek of a rotting corpse bloomed from the subterranean cooling larder. Three rats that had been chewing away happily on the decay scattered. Flies rose like a cloud. Mr. Jacobs gave a grief-stricken cry, John said, “Oh my God!” and Sherlock, wiping his hands together, stepped out of the pantry and strode back into the kitchen.
There wasn’t enough space on the balcony for more than the corpse and one consulting detective, so John, Lestrade, and some of the other officers waited inside for him to finish his examination.
“Jesus, Sherlock, I’m fine.”
,” said Sherlock, and he hid his eyes behind one hand.
have done, had luck not been on his side. And he knew what they had done to Molly.
For now, he put it out of his head and concentrated. He opened a search browser. While it loaded, he glanced back to Sherlock, who was ignoring him again, and then around the room, looking for further evidences of things that were not quite right with the world. There was the skull, perched on the mantle as always, and the books looked pretty much the same at a glance (he would explore this more thoroughly later). His chair and Sherlock’s were positioned the same as always, the couch had the same throw pillows, and the rug was the same faded red. Everything looked much as it always did. The only thing absent, that he could discern, was Sherlock’s music stand. But that probably didn’t mean a whole lot.
“I think, John, that, given my recklessness and propensity toward risky behaviors, the likelihood of your demise pales in comparison to my own. I shudder to think that my own body should be misidentified. It may, therefore, be prudent that someone who knows me well . . .”
“How . . . ? How am I supposed to know that?”
“You’ve been in there for thirty-four minutes already.”
Sherlock set his jaw, trying to hide his distress. He looked to the hallway leading to the bedroom. Still dark. Not a sound.
“I should have let you sleep,” she continued softly, “but I was too excited, I just had to see you.”
“And if you could hurry. It’s the first night of my cycle.”
“Body’s in the morgue. Curious tattoos up and down the arms. Naturally, Lestrade doesn’t know what to make of them. Are you coming?”
. I’m hunting them down, and I’ll kill them.”
“Eight days. That was the first day of John’s heat.”
“Why not?”
doesn’t want another heat, eh? You can inhibit an Alpha’s scent receptors. You can administer hormone therapies to counteract a forced bond or stabilize an Omega after estrus poisoning. Don’t tell me there’s no treatment for controlling, curtailing, or stopping the heats altogether.”
Alpha, Beta, and Omega, all fighting the same fight. There was something poetic about it, Sherlock thought, and John would have approved.
But never mind. Things were wonderful, new, and exciting.
“Right. That I can do,” said the cabbie, shaking his head and finally putting the car into gear. The meter started running.
“What is it?”
, not prohibitive. They’re no good until something has actually happened! And Alphas have to take the scent inhibitor while they’re in this hospital, but not out there, not on the streets where Omegas are most vulnerable.”
Sherlock was visibly taken aback, like he was impressed, but also a little disappointed in himself. John couldn’t quite explain why this one, of all the differences big and small, felt like a punch to the stomach.
“How could I have done such a thing?”
“Breakfast,” said Sherlock, lifting the mug and passing it into John’s hands. He watched closely for a reaction.
“Well. I’m . . . grateful to him. And always will be.”
Struck. Stuck. He remembered the needle.
Without even bothering to close the door, he fumbled frantically with his belt and buttons, feeling something well up inside of him, feeling something warm and wet sliding down his inner thighs. He threw open the lid to the toilet, spun around, and in one motion shoved his trousers and pants to the floor and sat on the toilet. He sobbed, equal parts relief and clenching pain, as something gushed out of him and loudly filled the bowl. He knew it. Diarrhea. If this wasn’t food poisoning—and he was 99 percent sure it was—it was the worst case of 24-hour flu he had ever known. He swore then and there to never eat another taco for the rest of his life.
he thought.
“We’ve found a good sub,” said Molly softly.
“We weren’t going to mention it,” Sherlock griped, shooting John a reproachful look over the rim of his glass.
Properly chastened, John set the book aside on the table beside his armchair. “I’ll take it back tomorrow.”
John pushed his feet. “Then I’m coming.”
“We’re the same person, you know,” said John. “Everything I’ve done, it’s been in him the whole time. So when it comes straight down to it, John and I are the same.”
John.
Where had
“Indeed. You wouldn’t have come to my doorstep at the crack of dawn with your hair in that unconditioned state if you hadn’t discovered a compelling new theory you were just desperate to share. Or test.”
“No . . .”
But Sherlock was stalking forward, a salacious grin on his face, a predatory gleam in his eye. It was an expression he’d never seen on his flatmate’s face before, and it made him appear a stranger. But before John could yell at him about the room, about privacy, about how exceedingly miserable he felt, Sherlock Holmes had crossed the floor. Three long, menacing strides, and he seized John, threw arms around his half-naked body, and lowered his mouth to John’s neck, biting.
Sherlock blinked his glassy eyes. “Right. Um. Give me a moment.”
“Just—” But despite his best efforts, John was struggling to hold everything in. His hands were shaking, and he felt overheated and about to crack. “Fucking hell, Sherlock.”
“God, I love you.”
“Why?”
Annoyed, John shook his head. “He probably just had a case or something. It’s fine. I’ll see him tomorrow when I go home.”
Harry was one of the least demonstrative people he knew. They didn’t exactly come from a
“That’s what I figured. So they’re out. I’m in.”
John let out a huff of laughter. “That’ll be the day.”
But did John really want to talk about
“Well, we can’t both be Scully. Never mind, it’s not important. You were saying.”
“Fuck me.”
“She was unbonded, so nothing severed. But she resisted, so she’s fighting infection.”
“He bonded with me. He did,” she said, crying into his shirt, and looking down, John could see the bond mark against her neck, surrounded by black bruises. The mark looked nothing like his own, which was a thin white ring of noticeable but fairly tame teeth marks. Molly’s was red and mean-looking, like the Alpha had chomped and torn and crushed. The skin had already sealed itself (apparently a property of an Alpha’s saliva), but it looked painful still. And John reflected on his own mark with a little bit of . . . gratitude.
