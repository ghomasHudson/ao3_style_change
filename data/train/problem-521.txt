“I warned you,” John said softly. “I warned you that I was going to fuck you until I can’t fuck anymore.”
Victor felt a wave of fear flow through him. Sherlock was a bit bigger than him and he knew he could beat him up if he wanted.
John let out a sigh of relief as the last of the water draining from the bag. At least Sherlock was done with the bag.
“Can I have his mobile number or something?” John asked. “I really want to tell him that I’m sorry for getting carried away.”
“Would you like that?” the doctor growled. “I’d like to hold you down and fuck you over and over. I wouldn't stop no matter how much you begged. You would be so sore."
“I think public service might be a better fit,” Lestrade said standing up from his desk. “We have a program called “Freshen” that helps with the local community. In this case, I think I will make you spend two Saturdays with them.”
The angle of his hips made it hard for Sherlock not to feel like he was on the edge of cumming. By the third stroke, he was close, and with each thrust, he felt the urge to explode.
The troublemaker was without his friend. Sherlock raised an eyebrow and stared down at the nervous looking John.  He glanced over his shoulder and found the hallway empty. Most of the children were on their way to lunch.
Sherlock was worried that John would run to a teacher about what he had seen. That was the last thing he wanted. He didn't need anyone finding out about his little habit.
Sherlock had just started calming down by the time his knot was starting to go down. John’s cock started to harden inside Sherlock’s tight passage.  It quickly became quite a bit thicker than Sherlock had been expecting. How could it keep getting bigger? The bunny gave a cry of pain as his tender passage was assaulted.
His mother had been very upset when she heard what had happened. At first, she’d been angry with John and wanted him expelled. Sherlock wasn’t going to allow that. He quickly told her the truth about what had been happening. Mrs. Holmes was disgusted at her son’s behavior. As soon as they got home from the hospital she had taken his Xbox One and PlayStation 4 out of his room. The items would only be returned once he had apologized to John.
“The only thing getting a break around here is you,” the wolf said forcing his hardening cock into Sherlock’s sore asshole. “Stop your complaining!”
That seemed to be what pushed Sherlock over the edge. He reached out and shoved John into the lockers hard. The boy let out a gasp of pain as his back came into contact with the metal doors. He slid down the wall and onto the floor.
Sherlock whimpered, hands gripping at the bedsheets as John fucked him harder, desperate to get as much of his dick inside him as he could. The bunny began to struggle to get away from painful fucking.
Whenever he had a case he would push food away until he had solved it. It was nearly impossible to think when his body was digesting food. It didn’t make John very happy but normally he went along with it.
Sherlock’s mother had stayed home with him most of the week to make sure he wasn’t in too much pain and didn’t hurt himself by accident.
The bunny let out a pain-filled scream as John began to fuck him. His throat was already sore from screaming but he couldn’t stop the sound from coming out. He felt so helpless. He was pinned to the floor with a massive cock inside of him. He squirmed, desperately trying to dislodge his lover’s erection.  Despite the pain he had already felt, the rumbling to his insides made him feel more pleasure than he had ever experienced before.
“We need to solve this case,” the taller man said squirting some soap onto his hands. “He’ll make me stay home and rest if he finds out I’m sick.”
Mrs. Megan Holmes worried about her younger son. Sherlock always seemed so distracted and unruly. She had suffered through the same problems with her older son Mycroft as well. Good old fashioned discipline had turned Mycroft into a model citizen. Despite the fact that she spanked Sherlock often and hard it didn’t seem to help. Sherlock’s father, Mike, was often traveling for his jewelry business but when he was home he made sure to keep his son in line. They tried to be the best parents they could.
Who was he kidding? Sherlock always took everything into account. Chances were he was just ignoring his body’s needs as usual.
Sherlock knew what Victor was going to say. His friend was constantly begging him to get help. Victor knew what the drugs were doing to him and he was scared one of these days he was going to overdose. Sherlock knew that wasn’t going to happen. He was far too careful to let anything like that happen.
John tried to relax as Mrs. Holmes handed the bag off to Sherlock. The two of them tried not to look at each other. John let out a gasp as the water started to flow in. The temperature was just fine but he could tell Mrs. Holmes overdid it with the soap.
Yet, something was clawing at the back of his brain. He had hit a nerve when he brought up his vomiting with Sherlock. There was something there and he was going to figure out what it was.
The doctor knew this had to be hard for his friend. These kinds of things were never easy to talk about. He sat down on the couch next to him making sure to give him lots of space. He didn’t want him to feel like he was being cornered.
Lestrade looked thoughtfully at the young boy. Clearly, he was holding something back. He knew something that he wasn’t willing to tell.
Lukas Miles was an eighteen-year-old University student who lived with his mother in London. Before he had gone missing his mother claimed nothing unusual had happened with him. Sherlock hadn’t spoken to his girlfriend yet but Mrs. MIles claimed everything was good between them.
John’s parents were pretty understanding about what had happened. His mother had sat him down and explained that he needed to tell her if anything like that happened again. His mother had forced him to help more with chores for the next few weeks because she still felt he had gotten out of hand.
“I know this has to be hard on you,” the doctor said through the door. “I just want you to talk to me.”
John's breath came in short, sharp gasps of air. He couldn’t believe how tight Sherlock was around his cock. How was he able to take his monster cock without being ripped apart? Precum was already leaking from the head of cock helping wet the bunny’s insides. He knew his bunny needed more lube but he wasn't about ready to stop and reapply it.
Victor was the only friend he had in this world. Maybe that was because he was such a miserable person.
“Sh,” he said kissing him. “Try and rest until my knot goes down. We’re going to have to go again right away.”
Moving was starting to feel better but it still hurt. Sherlock picked up the float and grunted it as he put it on the drying rack with the others. He walked out of the pool room and headed up towards his bedroom.
Sherlock watched with interest as he watched John get picked up for school by his mother. The woman fussed over the young boy as she took his backpack from him. Sherlock could hear her asking about his day. She really seemed to interested in his activities.
She had stepped out a few hours ago to do a “little” shopping. She promised that she wouldn’t be gone long but Sherlock knew she wouldn’t be back until dinner time.
Once he met John it became his job to worry about his eating habits. He was always after Sherlock to eat more. Having Rosie around helped a bit since they tried to have scheduled meals. Sherlock would always eat a bit but rarely a full plate.
He was a doctor and he needed to remember that. Part of him just wanted to push it aside as a fluke but he knew he couldn't. If someone came into his office concerned that a loved one was showing warning signs of an eating disorder he would address it. He wouldn’t tell them to ignore it.
Sherlock didn’t need to eat as much as everyone else. He’d been that way since he was a teenager. At the lunch table, his classmates would eat away at their lunch without a care in the world. Young Sherlock would simply pick at his food.
Sherlock moaned and twisted under his lover with excitement at the thought of doing that. John smirked at the raw joy on his rabbit’s face. He dropped Sherlock’s wrist. He wouldn’t tie the rabbit down for this. He wanted to feel him fighting.
Sherlock didn’t think so. Why would anyone want to be friends with someone who had been so cruel to them? He had sat down and tried to write an apology letter several times but he kept throwing it away. Nothing he wrote seemed right.
For the next week, John and Sherlock seemed to be the only thing their classmates talked about. Apparently, a lot of kids didn’t like Sherlock because of his smart mouth and were grateful that John had put him in his place. He didn’t brag about it but he was enjoying the warm way people were treating him.
Sherlock opened the stall and walked out. He didn’t know what to do. He knew Anderson would tell John was sick. After all, he was his doctor and friend. That was something he couldn’t allow to happen. If John found out about this he would never let it go.
“Don’t be such a dork,” the taller boy asked turned his attention on his friend. “John has  the right to make his own choices.”
What if he was wrong? What if Anderson had just misunderstood the situation? Sherlock might laugh at him for even thinking such a thing. Oh well, it was a risk he was going to have to take.
Apologizing was something Sherlock wanted to do. He knew he’d been horrible to John wanted to make things better. John had actually seemed concerned about him and he had harassed him. Maybe they could have been friends. Could they still be friends?
His own mother cleaned a hotel at night and his father waited tables at a restaurant. They had a small flat that was nice but nothing too fancy.
This was everything she could have hoped for! All the harsh discipline had worked. Her little man was growing up.
Sherlock pushed open the teen’s bedroom door. The room looked just as he expected. There was an unmade bed with a few dirty clothes next to it. There were open and closed school books sitting on a desk. A little black notebook sat on his dresser among scraps of papers and a hairbrush. He flipped open the book to find it full of numbers and dates. There was no way of telling what the numbers represented.
"Oh I do," John growled taking Sherlock's wrist in his own hands. "I love it when you break me down and release the wolf that I am. You make me just want to fuck all day and night."
The feeling of fire spread throughout his throat and his face. His breakfast quickly came up. He cleaned his fingers and face with a piece of toilet paper before flushing the toilet.
The detective got his feet and walked into the kitchen. He was starving. John was already gone that morning when he awoke so he had been able to skip breakfast. He opened the refrigerator door and stared at the mostly empty shelves.  John was due to do the shopping on the way home from work that day.
Sherlock felt like a child again. The way that John was staring at him was the same way his mother had looked at him. His eyes were filled with worry and a bit of anger. The detective sat on the couch and tried to avoid his friend’s gaze.
“I do this because I love you,” his mother said as she delivered the final blow. “This is for your own good Sherlock.”
He had managed to go that entire time with very little food. He’d mostly been living on coffee. John had made him breakfast a few times before he left for work. Sherlock would push a few forkfuls into his mouth to make his roommate happy. As soon as John was out of sight Sherlock would spit it in the trash.
John really wasn’t looking for a fight. He just wanted to go see his teacher. Why wouldn’t Sherlock just go away? Why had he decided John would make a good target?
“I think you should give him another chance,” John said. “I mean...I’m to blame for this mess too. I’m the one who got violent.”
Despite all his orgasms, he was ready for another. He needed to keep going. He needed to fuck Sherlock’s hole was overriding the soreness in his muscles. He reached down and spread the bunny’s cheeks.
Sherlock couldn’t help but smile as his mother pulled him in for a hug. While he wasn’t nuts about getting spanked by his friend it would be fun to see if his views were correct.
“I figured as much,” John said as he reached his side. “Don’t worry. I don’t have any problems with you.”
John quickly glanced down at his hands as Sherlock’s angry eyes settled on him. He felt bad that his father was going to cause his friend pain and embarrassment.
As they stepped inside Sherlock made his excuses and slipped off to the restroom. He made sure he was the only one in there before stepping into a stall.
“See how he does it?” Mrs. Holmes asked her son. “He’s not yelling and making a scene. That’s what a good child does.”
As he grew he hated what eating did to him more and more. It slowed his mind down. It made him tired and dumpy feeling. He ate when he was hungry. He could deal with that feeling when he was hungry. Wasn’t that enough?
Sherlock sat on the bed and curled up against the headboard. He picked up one of his pillows and held it close to his chest. He had no idea what to do. What would John do if he told him the truth? Would he send him away to a treatment center? He shivered at the thought.
“I’ll tell her you refused to listen to me. I’m sure your backside will feel wonderful after that,” John said a bit of a smile appearing on his face.
It seemed his hormones were already getting to his head. John needed to get inside his lover. He couldn’t mess around with fingering his bunny. Sherlock had given him a little show earlier in the day and fingered himself at great length. He was more than ready for it. The wolf grabbed a bottle of lubed and drizzled the thick liquid onto his rock hard cock.
Sherlock was sure Luka had an eating disorder he had worked hard to hide. His social media was full of hints but nothing that was obvious. The only question Sherlock had was what did this have to do with going missing? If he had checked into a program no doubt he would at least called his mother to let her know he was alright. Luka seemed to really care for his mother. His facebook full of pictures of the two of them together smiling and lots of loving messages to her. Of course, he knew social media profiles could be very misleading but he had met his mother. She really seemed to miss her son.
Before Sherlock had a chance to react John lunged forward. He sat down on the bed and grabbed his friend around his waist. Sherlock let out a yelp of surprise as he was flipped over his friend’s lap.
What was he supposed to say? Sherlock couldn't tell his friend he had an eating disorder. He'd never even mentioned his eating disorder to John. It was a private matter that he didn’t talk to anyone about.
Sherlock knew he shouldn’t have eaten that much food. That was the largest amount of food he’d eaten at once in months. He walked down to the bathroom and peeked around the room. There didn’t seem to anyone else in the room. He walked into one of the stalls and closed the lock with shaking hands.
His friend was being just as rough as his own mother. He began to twist and try to get away from the pain that was taking over his body. He needed to know how this was affecting john. Was it really exciting him?
The young boy turned his head towards the voice that was calling him. His eyes widened with fear at the sight of him. Maybe he thought John was coming after him next.
There was a bit of celebration going on at Scotland Yard. It had been a long case and without Sherlock, it wouldn’t have been solved. Of course, Sherlock didn’t seem overly thrilled. Solving the case never gave him the same joy as the chase did.  He would give himself a few days off and then actively start to look for another case.
John stopped walking and turned his head. He noticed the taller one was smirking at him. The shorter boy poked the taller one in the side.
“Here is what you need to know about the group,” he said, “Of course, I’m going to have to call your parents.”
Megan could hear her son and John talking in his room. If she was going to give Sherlock an enema she might as well take care of John as well. Dr. Watson claimed you can’t give enough enemas.
Sherlock grunt removing his sunglasses from his face. He knew Victor would be there with his homework pretty soon He needed a cigarette before his friend showed up. Victor always frowned at him and urged him to quit smoking. It was really starting to get annoying.
Could he throw his food back up? It was something he had promised himself he would never do again. He knew how dangerous it was for him to do.
“Aw,” she said sitting down next to him. “You’re worried I’ll be too busy to discipline you properly.”
For the most part, things were fine until about halfway through dinner. Sherlock was nearly done with his plate of chicken when he felt his stomach knot up.
Headmaster Lestrade stared down at him as John sat down in front of him. The teenager felt a wave of guilt overtake him. He had never gotten in trouble at school before. His mother was going to be so disappointed in him.
“I’m trying,” Sherlock said pushing his face into the hardwood floor. “I think...I think I’m going to die.”
That had been three days ago and John couldn’t wait for his chance. It felt like it was never going to come. His heart had nearly jumped for joy when Sherlock started running his mouth during a game of football. They had been playing a game with some classmates when their team lost. Sherlock started loudly yelling out the fact that the winner’s father was an alcoholic. John quickly drug his friend away.
Maybe Sherlock had been telling the truth. It wasn’t like him to get that stressed during a case but he did have more on his plate. While John was at his job Sherlock was at home taking care of his goddaughter.  Even when he was on cases he helped with Rosie. Of course, he never complained. He loved having little Rosie around and she always seemed to put a smile on his face. Maybe she was tiring him out and he didn’t even realize. Perhaps Sherlock hadn’t taken into account that carrying for a child would require him to rest and eat more.
Luckily since the boy was younger than him they didn’t have any of the classes together. That made it easier for John to avoid him. He was on his way to speak to a history teacher about a question on his homework when he bumped into Sherlock.
John was starting to relax as the Headmaster talked. He didn’t seem angry with him. Maybe he would be understanding after all.
Sherlock began to cry loudly as John spanked his behind over and over.  Sherlock, of course, continued to whimper pitifully as John gradually increased the pressure of the spanking on his butt cheeks. Sherlock was whimpering louder by the minute as his ass continued to hurt from the punishment, the waves of pain cutting through his sore cheeks as John punished his ass over and over.
Sherlock gagged several times. Frustration built in him as he simply dry heaved. He was almost ready to give up when he felt it.
John was on his feet and after him quickly. He knew he needed to get through to his friend. If Sherlock didn’t open up then things weren’t going to get any better. He ran into his room and slammed the door.
Tears filled his eyes as he was hit again. Through the pain and tears he tried to feel John’s erection rubbing up against him. He was enjoying this. Even though Sherlock was amused by the citation he was really starting to hurt.
Sherlock knew John was going to be watching his eating habits much closer after what he heard from Anderson. He didn’t have a case to blame for not eating so he didn’t really have any excuses.
“I just wanted to say thank you,” he said, cleaning his tears with his shirt sleeve. “The spankings and enemas really do help me.”
As soon as Sherlock felt John’s knot go down he jumped out of the bed. He needed to get away from John. There was no way he could take another fucking without a break. A break. He just needed a break.
John frowned and shook his head. Should he tell Headmaster about Sherlock’s suspected drug use? Maybe he just needed help with that.
John knew his next orgasm wouldn’t take long to reach. He needed to cum many times inside his lover. He needed to fill his tiny hole up with cum.  Despite all of Sherlock’s fighting his twitching sphincter was tightening and pulling him in deeper. His body knew what he needed. Suddenly, Sherlock's hips bucked and his cock burst with a jet of semen, firing jets of jizz along the ridge of his stomach. Tears fell down his eyes as he felt John’s knot start to form inside. Sherlock's body went limp against John feeling completely drained. He didn’t make much more than a grunt as John’s knot expanded in him.
Sherlock jumped to his feet and started for the kitchen. He wasn’t having this conversation. John stopped speaking as soon as Sherlock started walking. He didn’t want to scare him off. He needed Sherlock to understand he could trust him.
He folded up the pair of sunglasses and tucking them over the neck of his shirt. He stuck his hand in the hand in the warm water and gently pushed his float to the end of the pool. With a painful grunt, he climbed out of the pool.
“I want you to stop,” he whispered. “But I need you to keep going. Gag me if you need to. I...need more. I need you to rape me like the little bitch I am. Don’t go easy on me. Fuck me until I’m overflowing with your cum.”
That made John feel pretty guilty about getting off so lightly. He should have gotten in a lot more trouble.
He reached down and rubbed himself through his pants. He could still hear Sherlock sniveling through the wooden door. He stood up and walked over the bathroom.
Sherlock knew he had a food-related problem. It wasn’t normal for a person to have a panic attack every time they saw food. Sometimes eating didn’t bother him at all. He could go days and even weeks without becoming worked up by the thought of food. Other times food consumed his thoughts every second of every day.  It was every pea. Every carrot.
John’s own hands began to shake as he picked up Sherlock’s hair brush. He lifted the implement and brought it down hard on the younger boy’s backside. Sherlock let out a yelp of pain and pulled hard on the sheets.
"Oh god. Oh. Oh, shit...you feel so good. Oh God, oh GOD..." Sherlock cried as tears streamed down his face.
By the time he was sixteen, his mother was forcing him to sit and eat dinner with her. Sherlock hated it. He didn’t see the point in eating if he wasn’t hungry. Why did human beings eat when they weren’t hungry?
Victor seemed desperate that he got out of there. He didn’t come over as aggressive. In fact, he seemed scared and worried for him. John decided to take his chance and go before Sherlock did or said anything else. He quickly hurried off to his class while Victor had his friend’s attention.
"You, on the other hand, may have had a panic attack, yes, but you collapsed behind the door to Sherlock's room. By the time they got in you were out cold, they had to pump you full of fluids just to get your blood pressure back up, and your oxygen saturations were low."
And the phone rang dead, just in time for Sherlock to set off coughing again. John set his untouched coffee down on the kitchen side and made his way swiftly to his flatmate's side. His hands found their way into Sherlock's dark curls, brushing them away from his face as his body shook from exertion.
Amongst the spinning, he made out the odd person. Greg was definitely there for a moment, then Mycroft. They leaned in close to him and said words that his brain couldn't make out.
“John, why don’t you go home and take some time for yourself? You look like you’ve seen a ghost.” David said quietly, keeping his voice low to avoid the nurse sat beside him hearing them. John swallowed thickly, shaking his head quickly.
Sherlock squirmed slightly under the covers, trying to get his head closer to John's chest. He craved to cuddle into him, but this bloody oxygen and all his wires prevented him from turning on his side. He gave up eventually, only managing to scoot a few inches closer than before. He'd never been a man for physical affection, and he blamed the illness for making him effeminate and needy. "I apologise for scaring you, John. I did not expect my body to be weakened so much."
The older man calmed his breathing slightly, actually looking quite put together by the time he'd composed himself. John would forever be amazed by Sherlock Holmes, at his ability to make even the worst situations look easy.
"I'm under strict instruction not to separate you and Sherlock, despite my arguments." David continued. John couldn't hold back a snigger. "So we're going to get another bed in here. Do you think you'll be alright for a few minutes?"
"It's Thursday. You've been in and out of consciousness for nearly six days." She said softly. John frowned at her. Six days? "I've already bleeped your consultant, so he knows you're awake. He'll be by to see you soon. Shall we get you a little more comfortable?"
His breathing was quickening now, saliva pooling in his mouth that he couldn't swallow. He felt the all too familiar tightening in his chest, the nausea hitting him like a brick wall.
He half- ran to the door and was met by a stern looking man dressed in a black suit. "Doctor Watson" he said quickly, bundling a large bag into John's arms. John nodded at him in response, and another man appeared from behind, bustling past John with a monitor in one arm and a large tank in the other, almost lost under a mass of cables. He placed the monitor down on the kitchen table and returned to his spot behind the taller man in the doorway, leaving the oxygen tank beside John.
“I know, but I can’t treat you here. Sherlock, you have pneumonia. I need monitoring, an IV, oxygen, not to mention the medication you need.” He said; an edge to his voice. He was almost angry at himself that he wasn’t enough to help. Sherlock took a shallow breath in.
Sherlock's eyes darted between the people stood by his bed, returning to John each time. John didn't know where to put himself, knees shaking in an attempt to remain standing despite his exhaustion.
"Like you can talk about putting yourself at risk. I'm not the one that gave himself pneumonia from not looking after himself!"
"Your sats just weren't maintaining and you didn't have the energy to cough all the gunk out from your chest." The consultant said softly.
David interrupted timidly, as though he didn't want to break up the touching moment between the two friends.
There was silence for a few moments, John and Sherlock just staring at each other. Frankie and David stayed quiet, and it happened that the loudest sound in the room was John's heavy breathing.
"John, you and I both know that isn't going to happen. I will get you anything you could possibly need, I trust you have all the skills necessary to care for my brother."
John nodded once more. "Thank you." And shut the door, turning quickly to get back to Sherlock. John wheeled the oxygen tank through to the bedroom, the large duffel bag tucked under his arm, and perched himself next to Sherlock on the bed.
"Sherlock?" He said meekly, knees wobbling in an attempt to stand, to reach over and place a hand on his cheek.
"Sherlock, if you don't calm down we will be forced to separate you and John. It's not good for you to be so stressed."
John smiled slightly. "I'm okay." He said quietly, voice still hoarse and painful. He reached for the glass of water on the table in front of him, and David lifted his oxygen mask to enable him to take a drink.
This warranted a slight snigger from Sherlock, who looked significantly more comfortable after only a few minutes on the oxygen. John glanced at the monitor again; sats of 79%, getting there.
Sepsis - Or Septicaemia, refers to an infection that has spread and caused bloodstream involvement. The body's natural immune response to the infection can cause multi organ failure and death if not treated quickly with antibiotics.
David was standing in the room, along with two other doctors. They were chatting, and turned as Greg pushed John towards them.
"Afraid not. I'm going to get chest physio to take a look at you as well, the nurses tell me that when your oxygen came off this morning your sats dropped to 80%."
He sat back and sighed, eyes dropping again. The sound of the whirring fluid pump pulled him back to sleep.
John knew it would pass, of course he did, but he wished it would pass sooner. The whole room spun uneasily in front of him, and he took deep breaths through his nose to calm it. At least it seemed to work.
Oedematous - (oedema) An accumulation of fluid in the tissues of the body. Tends to present in extremities such as ankles and wrists. Can be caused by fluid overload, and is very common in patients receiving high doses of fluid in intensive care units.
His hands rubbed circles on Sherlock’s back until the coughs subsided and he slumped back into John’s arms. John noted the shivers.
David left the room shortly after, telling John that a new plan would be made in the morning on ward round. John was informed that it was half past six in the evening.
John made his way over to the drawers in the bedroom, and for a second marvelled at how well he'd placed all of his equipment, if he did say so himself. He picked up a bottle of the antibiotics and a giving set, quickly priming the line before walking over to Sherlock.
"Hey!" John snapped, pushing Sherlock in the chest. "Remember what I said? Deep breaths" Sherlock looked at him from heavy lidded eyes, his chest rising and falling awkwardly as he tried to steady his breathing. John placed his hand back to his chest "Breathe with me."
Sherlock’s eyes widened. “N-no. You’re a doctor.” He muttered; his voice stronger now his breathing was under control. John shook his head, running a hand through his hair.
"Sher, 're you alright?" John's voice was tired and gravelly. Sherlock wondered for a moment how they'd both ended up in this situation; sitting beside each other in their hospital beds.
When the doors to the ambulance opened, everything went too fast. Wendy and John took it in turn to shout things to the A&E staff as they pushed Sherlock into the hospital, people were running and injecting things into his IV. People were shouting things about brain damage and chest drains and John couldnt keep his head straight, couldn't even see Sherlock under the mess of wires and hands on him.
There had been a long period of time when the simple task of breathing was taken from him, plastic covering his face and forcing his lungs to expand and contract.
As if on que, a short woman walked in, obviously a nurse. She smiled sweetly at John, her short blonde hair reminding him of the young Marilyn Monroe.
"We've managed to stabilise him and get him up to ICU. He's got bilateral chest drains in and he's still on the ventilator. We thought it best to leave him on it until his lungs are clearer and he's gained some strength back."
John didn't say anything to that, mouth pressed closed in a hard line. He felt empty, like he'd let everyone down. His chest lurched at the realisation, and David glanced up at the monitor as the beeping intensified only a fraction.
“..h’rts” the detective murmured between breaths. John dug around under the bed, pulling out his black bag and placing it on the bed bedside Sherlock as he took a seat by his head.
He placed a hand on Sherlock’s chest and breathed with him for a minute, satisfied when the thrumming beneath his hand reduced to something that almost resembled a normal rhythm.
The room was quite large, and the lighting was dimmed to a soft glow. Large bay windows covered one wall, but the blinds were closed and only a small sliver of daylight peeped out at floor level. As John swung the door open, he had to focus just to stop his legs from buckling where he stood.
"I can't get a blood pressure on him, last one I got was 62/25. He's had 1 litre of IV fluid, 500mg of paracetamol and 500mg of Levofloxacin IV."
John allowed himself to bathe in that for a moment; that he was alive, and Sherlock Holmes, of all people, was glad of it.
"A doctor with a severe chest infection and sepsis! How on earth can you think that he was sound of mind?" Sherlock was shaking slightly now, his breath slightly quicker.
The right hand was much more free, only tethered by a sats probe on his index finger. A peripheral cannula was sited in the crook of his right elbow, although it was capped off and not in use. The one in his left hand from before had clearly been removed.
Sherlock’s teeth chattered as the air ran over his overly warm chest, causing his shivers to increase. John strode swiftly to the wardrobe, pulling a thin blue blanket from the top cupboard and laying it over his boxer-clad roommate.
John watched, bleary eyed, as a second bed was pulled into the room. He wasn't really paying attention, and the mumbled chatting of the others went straight over him, swam around in his head like a foreign language he didn't understand.
"You scared me, you idiot." John's voice was softer now, and he reached forward to clasp Sherlock's hand in his through the bars.
He was Sherlock's consultant, seemingly. He'd introduced himself to John as "Doctor Reynolds, but you can call me David."
Sherlock nodded, and John ran a hand once more through his dark curls before a brisk knock at the door sounded.
The oxygen mask was still in place on his face, whistling ever so slightly at the constant stream it supplied. He glanced over to the fluid pump. The rate had been turned up a notch, and he rolled his eyes at the setback.
Catheter - a tube inserted into the bladder through the urethra. Drains urine out of the body and into a bag, enabling for accurate measurement of lost fluid.
He hung up and shoved his phone in his pocket, he didn't have time to answer questions about the blue tinge to Sherlock's lips or how fast his heart was weakening.
The two men fell asleep like that, content with one another, and John put at ease by the constant thrumming under his fingertips.
The ride in the ambulance didn't last much longer, but John felt more like himself by the time they arrived. He spent the last minutes in the ambulance listening to Sherlock's chest, swearing under his breath at the noisy crackles on his lungs, much worse than yesterday.
John clipped the pulse oximeter onto the end of Sherlock's left index finger, waiting impatiently and then swearing under his breath when the monitor read a grim 69%. An alarm chimed loudly, and John promptly silenced it.
It was a while before the aforementioned doctor appeared in the room. Sherlock dozed on and off, watching John with the rest of his time.
"Hiya mate, how you doing?" He asked, the beam on his face making John feel slightly happier, if nothing else.
“What hurts?” John spoke loudly, trying to keep the attention of the other man. His fingers found a quick and thready pulse at Sherlock’s right wrist.
John took a second to breathe, his head swimming with information. Sherlock's vitals had appeared on the new monitors, just as grim as before.
The door swung further than John had anticipated, and he almost fell back down the stairs in an attempt to conceal himself from the men that he so honestly believed would be inside.
By the third breath, 2 paramedics were in the room, and John allowed himself to finally sit back, tears stinging his eyes as one placed a bag-valve mask over Sherlock's face and took over his breathing. John would kick Mycroft later for not providing him with one.
John nodded quietly, feeling rather out of his depth and small in the moment. Doctor Reynolds smiled slightly at him and placed a hand on his shoulder.
"Blood pressure's coming up a bit." He heard David say, his voice barking orders at the more junior staff. "Let's put that oxygen up to four litres. Get those IV fluids back up. I'm going to go and speak to my reg."
"I do. My associate will be in touch within the hour." Mycroft sighed, John could almost hear him stiffening up. "Take care of him, John. I don't want to trouble the parent system with this."
The 10 or so steps into John’s bedroom were slow, and the wheezing from Sherlock just continued to worry him more. Sherlock let out a low wheeze as John lowered him down and his body hit the mattress, and John pulled his legs round so he was laid flat.
When the doorbell rang, it jolted John slightly. Who would bother calling at 9pm on a Sunday? He walked briskly to the door, and was met by a young-ish blonde girl. In her arms she carried a large contraption, and John recognised it from his limited work at the hospital.
John was asleep within moments, ragged breathing evening out slightly, and Sherlock took only a moment to look him over before looking up at Aimee.
Greg and John chatted idly for a while, until Frankie flitted back into the room, slightly flustered.
The monitor shrilled loudly as John grappled for his phone, his other hand roughly fumbled for Sherlock's carotid pulse. He dialled the three digits clumsily, feeling the too quick and too faint thrum of Sherlock's pulse beneath his fingers.
"What's happening to John?" He said curtly. A smile did not grace his face. David inhaled sharply and coughed.
"There will be a consultant at your disposal as well as a full team of nurses. They have been told to run everything past you." John shook his head.
He tried to disguise a cough, which didn't work. Before he really knew what was happening, John was in the middle of a coughing fit and fighting to catch his breath. Frankie was kneeling beside him, a hand moving over his back in circles. He hunched over, relieved when the hacking subsided and he could get a proper breath in.
Hypovolemic shock - a condition that presents once 20% or more of the body's fluid or blood volume is lost. Will cause death if left untreated. Most commonly seen after traumatic blood loss, but can also be caused by severe dehydration.
His heard the noise of John's footsteps receding and sighed in impatience. The annoying little idiot.
John lifted Sherlock’s cherry pants from the middle so that it stuck snugly in the crack between his two butt cheeks . Sherlock would never have thought that that would be  filthier than totally removing the pants. He was happy to be wrong and  felt exposed, vulnerable and that much slutty. He gripped the legs of the chair with both his hands and waited for John's next move.
If that was not the hottest thing John has ever seen for the forty seven years of his adventure-filled life of three continents' reputation, he would eat Sherlock's dressing gown too, once he finishes with the cherry flavored, ice cream soaked, pre-cum dressed pants. Even if it is poisoned.
John ran his fingers all over Sherlock’s thighs and kissed Sherlock’s groin. He moved Sherlock’s legs apart ,  stretched them wide open and placed them on top of his shoulders. It left Sherlock whimpering.
Observant as he was, this was no mystery to Sherlock. He knew, and it was all he could do to just get up from the bed and throw himself at John's feet. He  swallowed, and collected himself to try at nonchalance.
John took another  large scoop of ice cream and placed it on Sherlock’s spine, making him shiver. Then he licked it too,  savouring the sweetness of the ice cream and the salty tang of the fine sheen of sweat that has broken in Sherlock's skin. "Oh! Love, my love, my sweet, gorgeous boy, " he whispered into Sherlock's skin, "You make me so hungry"
‘No, let me do the unwrapping, it’s Daddy’s day after all.’ said the said Daddy with an ungodly smirk.
"I don’t think you can hold it for as long a time as you have planned,Daddy. You already seem to be too close to coming" Sherlock drawled, and of course he was trying to get a rise out of John.
Sherlock shivered yet again,  this time, not because of the cold, but because of the sheer, raw want he heard in his Daddy's sensuous voice.
But this is not how John has planned to end the night. He moved away from Sherlock, although he now loathed to make his baby boy feel empty and bereft even for a moment .
‘I can assure you John , it  is in the best of your interest. You don’t know something that your 3 year old knows.And we are here to enlighten you’’
‘Ten  on your left cheek for being cheeky. Ten on your right because it pleases Daddy to watch you helpless and squirming. Yes?'
"Oh Fuck Daddy , I told you I will", Sherlock hissed, craning his head so John could see the look of impatience and disdain in his razor sharp eyes.
And 'Sleeping Beauty' did John read, but the Beauty slept not for a long long while. He could almost hear the misery and impatience of the man waiting downstairs, holding his breath in fear of making the slightest noise which might awaken the toddler girl.
Sherlock did everything with single-minded passion. He loved like a heart attack. Poignant. Arresting. Deadly intense. There was nothing he wouldn't do for John, as John learned the hard way.
Finally the loo door opened ,John entered with a cool whiff of body wash and shampoo , fresh and properly dressed and immediately chuckled watching the rhythmic writhing of Sherlock’s gorgeous body  in tandem with the vibration of the little machine.
A slow smile appeared on John Watson's face. ‘ Next time when I’m in command, my baby boy, I am gonna leave you naked , legs stretched up , hands resting under your head and I won’t come back for an hour. And when I come back I won’t touch you. Instead I will listen to how much you need me and desire for my touch over your naked skin while I make you watch me wank and please myself’
And Sherlock arched his body up, surging like an ocean wave, to meet John, with a fervor equally ferocious. "Yes,  yes Daddy, please, Hnnngh!" His eyes widened when their erect cocks slid together and he just rutted against John's for dear life.
Pure and undiluted lust ran along his veins like liquid fire and set him ablaze and every nerve ending sparkled like Christmas lights and with every breath he exhaled he-just-sobbed! His sweaty face was tear streaked and burning and blushed and he felt glorious. He felt revered.
‘No …I want whatever you are planning for me John,  although I don't believe that you can surprise me for long (John just raised his eyebrows at that because only this gorgeous git can look that smug while being stark naked and completely at John's mercy) …Remember it was you who got lost in the heat of the moment. But I am ready to continue from where we've dropped off,  Daddy (uttered in a sultry drawl) Because whatever you give me tonight am gonna give you back a hundred times better tomorrow’ Sherlock winked.
A shiver ran down the detective’s spine for the second time within mere ten minutes into the night because John was not gonna just fuck and end. He had plans, Sherlock realized.
It was two way edging, God help him, John alone knew how hard it was to hold back when Sherlock looked so invitingly fuckable!
Sherlock surged forward, as if he was dying and John was his one lifeline, and clung on to him, burrowing his head in John's chest and John whispered an oh god.
'Good boy’ John kissed Sherlock’s exposed chest , flicking his tongue over the hardened nubs of his nipples and  licked his way up, worshipping Sherlock’s skin like some pagan priest at his deity, mouthing at his neck as he stroked his denim-clad bulge against Sherlock’s much harder dick . Soft sighs escaping Sherlock's lips… soft moans vibrating in his neck, soft trembling in his muscles…
Mouthy bratty cute detective in a strop.  Oh John is gonna fuck him very much."Now go wear that, because it's either that or the deerstalker "
‘Now ‘ John tilted his head down, his lips touching Sherlock’s ear, warm susuress of his breath a caress, ‘I am gonna involve you in a proper bondage. I love you and I take care of you and you may have things to fear but nothing to worry about. And you have got to ask me to stop  if and when  you don’t want to continue  it. Did you hear me boy?"’
Sherlock clutched at the cotton of the bed cover  and moaned John’s name. John kept licking Sherlock and eating the red pants until the cherry flavored fabric was completely devoured. ‘That was delicious.’ John smiled, smacking his lips filthily, and licked the drool off his lips with a wolfy grin.
John blushed seeing himself thus  fitted perfectly and Sherlock's heart squeezed with a surge of love. He smiled seeing his controlling,commanding Daddy blushing like a teenager , and chose not to utter a word.
Sherlock bit back a scream which threatened to escape him due to the shock at the sudden  cold . The cream started absorbing heat from Sherlock's tumescence, melting and dripping all over his length and the cherry pants started soaking it up,reducing Sherlock into a moaning , panting , writhing mess ..
And John bent down, lifted his chin with one hand and kissed the pretty pout right out of the cupid's bow lips. It was only a quick kiss. It wouldn't do to spoil the brat this early into the night.
And when he opened them again, John has left the room. He listened as John turned on the television and turned the volume up  enough to reach Sherlock.
‘No. That was a bonus again’ and John was deeply satisfied playing  by his own rules and painting that luscious  ass as red and bright and hot as the cherry pants his baby boy  was wearing.
" And I trust you to stop me immediately if its getting too much for you, or you stop enjoying, or you feel-"
Rosie walked towards John in toddling steps and planted a kiss on his cheek.In a reflex John hugged Rosie tight and kissed her back ‘ Wow, what was that for ?Is it my birthday?"
It went on for quite some time before John realized he got so carried away and was at a hair's breadth from losing his character altogether. He swore under his breath and quickly removed himself. Sherlock groaned at the loss of touch and then came back to his senses ‘Oh fuck! Seriously John ? Do we really have to play games for getting to each other?’, he mumbled, almost..almost reaching out for John.
With that John too, went down on his knees in front of his now submissive detective and crouched down . Then, that clever tongue was licking  the entire length of Sherlock’s erect penis, taking in the  cherry flavor and the musky scent of Sherlock's sex on the slightly transparent red pants he was wearing. A shiver ran down Sherlock’s spine  straight to his cock which twitched immediately. ‘If u think I’ll save something for you, you are highly mistaken . If somebody is eating that cherry thing out of someone’s arse, it’s gonna be me, Sherlock  ‘
He spat on his palm, and slicked himself up with it.  It wasn't much, but it will have to do. He drew the vibrator out and entered Sherlock, with quick, short, brutal thrusts. Just the way Sherlock preferred it. And buried himself inside Sherlock to the hilt. Sherlock's moan was low and drawn out as he was savouring the fullness inside him. Unlike the vibrator, John's penis was full of life, throbbing with his heart beat, warm with his own passion,  making love to Sherlock's passage.
They stole a quick kiss. It may look as if John was in command, but ultimately, it was Sherlock's call. John knew this, and didn't really mind.
And John's thrusts became violent and haphazard, stronger and brutal, " come for me, love" he growled, and untied Sherlock's hands.
John switched on the vibrator and set it on its minimum speed. ‘Oh! By the way, darling, you are not allowed to cum.’
John Watson was no bossy arsehole , neither was he some perverted control freak. But he loved taking charge of the situation , especially if the situation is either dangerous , or romantic. Sex with Sherlock is mostly a combination of both. He relished the trust his partner placed in him. He loved being the hero. Sherlock, in his turn, loved being taken care of. In sex, and only in sex, he let himself be the damsel in distress to John's hero, being the sub, thus playing right into John's subconscious desires.
‘Do you want me to unwrap it for you John ?’, Sherlock rumbled in a tone deeper than his usual baritone , looking at John from beneath his eyelashes.
Supporting himself by firmly placing his hands on either side of Sherlock, John hovered over him. Holding Sherlock's expectant gaze with a smoldering one of his own,  John clutched his left shoulder with his right hand when he placed his left hand over his sub’s chest. Sherlock’s entire body shivered at the simple touch of his John,   after being naked and exposed to cool air for so long.
John watched in satisfaction while Sherlock's body spasmed with the endless stimulation to his prostate, so helpless, so debauched, so so very gorgeous. Sweat glistening on his skin, lips swollen red and fallen open in a silent "Oh".
He was on the final end of the edge, held there with the flimsiest of threads of conscious will and he was going to fall. He had to tell John but he couldn't...he was lost somewhere.
‘Are you seriously suggesting that I am hurting you with those baby slaps or are you  just resisting to tempt me further?’
Euphoria hit Sherlock like there was no tomorrow, as streak after streak of cum shot from his cock, painting his and John's chest, even ending up on John's hair,long after John took his hand away from his neck. His mouth opened in a silent scream,  his body shattering, wracking with the power of his orgasm. He heard John pleading " love, Sherlock, breathe for me, breathe…". He felt deliriously ecstatic,  thoroughly debauched and used. He looked at John , and croaked, "fill me up, Daddy"
John remained silent and added a third finger and pushed them all further inside. Sherlock yelled John’s name and clawed at the covers .Then John was moving his fingers up and down inside Sherlock in a punishingly slow rhythm.  ‘Want you inside John’, Sherlock pleaded.
He then started dragging the silken cloth along Sherlock's pectorals, watching the snakelike glide of it on the marble-like plains and valleys of Sherlock's skin, watching how it tickles the detective, watching how he restrains himself from twitching,
'Atleast! next time when we are eating edible pants,can I get  honey? Instead of you know the cherry ? Will go great with the whipped cream sitting useless in Mrs.Hudson's fridge.'
‘You are gonna fail your Daddy , if you cum before I said you could. Are you gonna hold it for me, boy? Are you gonna wait for Daddy to fuck you ?Are you gonna try hard and hold it for me Sherlock ?’
'So , baby boy wanted  to eat Daddy’s pants off? It seems like I’ll be the one taking the pleasure now.’
John does that sometimes. He watches you with a soft expression on his face and says the dirtiest things,  the most  dangerous things in his mild bedside tone,  that save for the naked desire now and then flickering in the stormy surfaces of his ocean-blue eyes, nothing would betray how much it costs him to hold himself back from fucking Sherlock raw and just shoot his cum way inside his glorious arsehole.
There was so much he wanted to tell Sherlock. But Sherlock looked at his eyes and understood. Words of endearment were superfluous.
John spread Sherlock's legs further apart and settled himself between his thighs. At the first wet stroke of John's wet, hot and expert tongue on his opening, Sherlock's body arched up with pleasure. "Johnnnn.. "he groaned, repeatedly, like a mantra, as John's tongue playfully glided around his arsehole, occasionally sliding over it. Just as Sherlock thought that there will be no end to John's teasing, he felt the wicked tongue purposefully and determinedly attacking him just there and oh my god that lapping noise he was making was making it fucking obscene ! He was slowly and steadily coaxing Sherlock's anal sphincter open and being at John's mercy for pleasure felt so good it took Sherlock's breath away. John then moved away, and chuckled at the involuntary noise of protest Sherlock made. He dipped his fingers in the ice cream again, spread Sherlock’s legs further apart and slowly stroked Sherlock’s hole with one of his fingers. Sherlock hissed at the chill, but didn't dare close his thighs. He was going to be so good for his Daddy tonight. John moved his finger up and down and around the hole for a full minute and the teasing felt like an eternity.  And then he slowly pushed that finger into Sherlock. Sherlock moaned with the pain of breach and the pleasure of finally getting the feeling of John inside him. John smiled and added a second finger and moved them inside Sherlock lightly. ’John’ Sherlock heaved. ‘fuck me John’
And John wrapped one hand around Sherlock's swan-like neck, which looked delicate , was smooth and slick to touch but definitely strong and masculine, and squeezed it tight, momentarily cutting the flow of oxygen to his brain.
John licked a strand of melted cream off the pants, earning another gasp fromSherlock. Relentless in the art of torment, John licked and licked and licked, rolling his clever tongue over the melting ice cream and the cherry flavor and occasionally Sherlock’s balls. Sherlock’s thighs were trembling uncontrollably on either side of John's head, giving in to the sensation and he had to firmly hold them in place with his strong hands to enjoy his meal without interruption. Sherlock  panted and groaned while John was tearing ,licking and eating the pants off Sherlock, moaning for him to hear.
There Sherlock was, wearing naught but a pair of flimsy, satiny red pants. It's bright, blood red hue standing in vivid contrast to the marble-like skin of his slim, athletic thighs and concave abdomen, his impressive junk caged in.
‘No…I started all these because …  it’s Daddy’s day after all…so go ahead…Do whatever you like to me…But make it quick.. I can't.. I want you so much John! " Sherlock looked surprised by the power of his own want.
‘I know how much you want to get fucked..’ John removed his fingers ‘but Daddy needs a shower, I am all covered in cream and cherry. But don’t worry dear boy , you want to get fucked , you will get that.’
He hears the bathroom door open, and the detective carries the freshly showered three year old,  bundled in a fluffy, pink towel, her head snugly resting on Sherlock's chest.
John walked towards his too good to be true husband and while the clever detective was absolutely right, it’s John’s day and John can do and say  whatever  he likes . John fixed his eyes  on the taller man, silently commanding the other man to do the same while he licked his lips seeing that Sherlock is doing exactly what he wanted  and suddenly groped Sherlock’s cherry satiny bulge so hard that Sherlock almost trembled on his feet and had to hold John’s shoulder for support while he mourned against John’s neck ‘You are not in charge tonight’ John whispered and bit Sherlock’s ear  ‘Lie down on your back , stretch your long legs up  and rest both of your hands under your head. Say 'Yes Daddy, as you command’ "John was still groping Sherlock’s balls and Sherlock for the first time realized it’s not a day to be some mouthy bratty detective because John is not gonna play safe.
The steady beat of Sherlock's heart was reassuring. . John felt sated and sighed, craning his neck to look at Sherlock. He was watching John from beneath his eyelids, moonlit eyes brimming with love.
John Watson may look like an unassuming, kitty-hugging, average looking doctor at your local clinic. But Sherlock knows, more than you'd ever do, that John Watson still lives up to his Three Continents Reputation of Sexual Conquests with the same fervor he maintained when he was twenty something, invading bloody Afghanistan.
‘I m going to tidy up this bed and wash the dishes because you can never be arsed to do the household chores, hmm? And what are you gonna do in the meantime ?’
‘Not for toddlers ‘ Sherlock whispered, ' get yourself off to bed with daddy,  Watson" . He gave a playful shove to the girl's shoulder.
‘Though it’s completely unfair, but well , Pleasure's are Daddy's to take. Who am I to have desires…  just another boy to Daddy Watson !?’ Sherlock pouted.
And made Sherlock watch him going about cleaning up the room, as if he was completely oblivious to Sherlock's peril.
‘Um… I don’t want to make it quick..that’s the problem. I have other plans,.So… if you don’t want it , we can stop it.’
Sherlock’s hips  thrashed about on their own volition , constantly, there was no rest to it. The tiny heartless intruder was massaging his prostate in that maddeningly slow rhythm, and his entire body was vibrating with a low buzz. He felt himself succumbing into the power of the little machine. He was losing control. His whole self shaking on its own accord in a loop of pleasure pain, oh fuck, he needed more, he needed relief, he needed this to end,  he needed this to continue forever, he needed John-John! John!!
Sherlock heard John picking up something from the bed. ‘You know  what Daddy’s gonna have for dinner? Daddy’s gonna have some Ice cream ’ with this John  put  a scoop of ice-cream right on top of Sherlock’s dick over his edible satin pants ‘goes great with cherry’
‘Oh God ‘  Sherlock snatched  the box from John's hand  and tore the wrapping paper apart ‘ Just open the fucking box , and wear that silly red thing I bought for you so that I could unwrap what’s mine. Would you do that? Captain?’
Sats/sats probe - short for oxygen saturations, refers to the amount of oxygen present in the bloodstream. Optimal saturations on room air 94 - 99%, any lower will require supplemental oxygen. Measures using a sats probe/pulse oximeter, a small clip placed on the finger.
"I need an oxygen cylinder and a mask right now or I'm going to have to ring an ambulance" he spoke quickly, only now realising his breath coming fast. "Monitoring equipment; pulse, resps, blood pressure, sats. Chest X-ray. I need an IV line, analgesia, anti-emetics and antibiotics. How long?"
The rest of the morning went without incident, he even had a few slices of toast for his lunch. The IV fluids were slowed slightly and he was encouraged to drink as much as possible to make up for it.
John turned and looked at Sherlock with a pitiful smile on his face, he had to admit, the other man didn't actually look much better. His face remained flushed and sweaty, and his breathing was still laboured and wheezy.
He dug around in the bag once again, pulling 5 electrodes out. After removing the backing, he stuck them carefully to areas of Sherlock's chest, and once the wires were connected, a fast and not quite regular rhythm displayed on the screen.
It had taken him this long to recognise that the room he was in was not as he remembered. Mainly due to the lack of another bed, and the distinct absence of Sherlock Holmes.
Eventually, a knock at the door roused John from his dazed state, and Dr Reynolds stood in the doorway.
"Just let our doctors get him sorted. We will come and get you when they're ready." She turned around and walked away.
"Well," David began. He stood up from his chair, eyes flitting over to the monitor above John's bed for a moment.
John knelt down before Sherlock, whose face twisted in a sort of lopsided smile, and it was almost as though a switch flicked in his head as the doctor in him sprang to life.
He hung the antibiotics next to the fluids on the curtain pole, retrieving the paracetamol bottle and throwing it in the bedroom bin."Can I take some blood from you, Sherlock?"
"We should intubate him before we move him, leaving it any longer is risky." She said quickly. The other paramedic, a man who John would guess to be in his late 30's, nodded in agreement and continued controlling Sherlock's breathing. John thought he'd never felt more useless in his whole life.
He was a middle aged man, slightly younger than John but with a thinning hairline none the less. John wondered for a moment why Mycroft considered him to be the best for the job.
"Don't try and talk, you have a tube in your throat." John kept his voice soft and quiet, squeezing Sherlock's fingers once more.
"I trust you more than any of these doctors, John. I will always trust you to do what is best for my brother. Please."
"You can go up and be with Sherlock." David started. "But a nurse goes with you, and she will repeat your obs just like they've been doing here."
By the time the bed was ready, John really was faltering. His blood pressure was dropping further, and his head felt heavy and useless on his shoulders.
When John came back around, it was dark. Mycroft and Greg weren't in the room. A voice was saying his name, and not one that he recognised.
Midazolam is a sedation drug. We use it at work to calm distressed patients as well as for aggression and alcohol withdrawal.
John laughed, "Only the usual amount, Mycroft. He's doing better, thank you for sending all those supplies."
"Is that better?" She asked. John smiled and nodded, chose not to tell her that he didn't want any of it touching him at all.
"It's alright John, I'm fine." He replied. John blinked slowly, his eyes wandering around the room. He fixed his gaze on Aimee, who was stood up now, leaning on the end of his bed.
John laid quiet, sleeping fairly soundly baring in mind the circumstances. Sherlock thought that the sound of the oxygen must be very irritating for him; he remembered it from his short stint at home, before he'd ended up in this dreadful place.
She went off to get him some, mentioning something about working with them in order to get better. John had said it to countless patients in his time, why was it so hard to take his own advice?
Sherlock nodded again, making no sound but blinking at John with glossy, feverish eyes. John gave a half smile and ran his fingers through Sherlock’s curls once before turning and retrieving his stethoscope from where he’d discarded it on the bed. Re-warming the end, he put the earpieces in his ears and moved one hand to Sherlock’s waist to steady him.
John sighed outwardly, feeling more responsible than ever for leaving Sherlock on his own for the week. He should have known it was a bad idea.
Sherlock was slumped on the floor, barely propped up by the wall behind his head. His skin was pale and sweat beaded across his forehead, dampening his dark curls, sticking some to his head while others stuck out unceremoniously. His clothes had obviously not changed for days, and his shirt remained on him only by the fastening of one button in the middle.
"There are conditions." He said, looking John in the eyes. He stepped further into the room, until he was almost too far into his comfort zone.
The three men turned a corner into ICU, walking past the main bay and into a smaller corridor behind it. David showed John and Mycroft to a room on their left.
He rose from his chair, exchanged the usual pleasantries with the doctor and walked briskly to Sherlock’s room, closing the door hard against the frame and cringing at the loud bang it created. He was dizzy, wobbling on the spot. He stood with his back against the door for a few minutes, eyes closed and trying to slow his too-fast breathing.
"You should be up and out by the end of tomorrow, okay? Don't stress about it." David said quickly, eyes flirting between John's face and the monitor, his fingers still tight around John's pulse.
Ideally, an IV would get his dehydration under control, as well as administering antibiotics to fight the infection, and in a hospital environment John would have direct access to monitoring for his vitals at all times. He know that would be best for Sherlock, and would mean a quicker recovery time, but he also knew the fuss Sherlock could kick up when he didn’t want to do something.
Tachy - short for tachycardia. Refers to a resting heart rate over 100bpm. Can be completely harmless, but can also be a symptom of other conditions.
Central Line - Also known as a Central Venous Line. A catheter placed into a large vein, usually in the neck or groin, for administering fluids, medication or nutrition over a longer period of time. Central Lines can remain in longer than peripheral lines, and can be used to give large amounts of fluid quickly. They can have multiple ports (lumens), and so several things can be run at once. They can also be used to take blood samples from.
He counted in his head as he pulled items from the bag. 6 bags of normal saline, 8 bottles of paracetamol, 7 doses of antibiotic (Levofloxacin no less, one of John's favourites), a spare cannulation pack, 4 spare needles, a nasal cannula, and an assortment of blood taking bottles laying in the bottom of the bag. John took his time organising each item into careful piles on the drawers in the bedroom opposite Sherlock.
John nodded, of course she wouldn't be able to go into the detail that he wanted. She was scribbling down on her chart now, transferring the information from the monitor.
John reached up with his free hand to scratch an itch on his neck. He'd felt the bloody thing before the nurse had a chance to pull his hand away.
He grumbled a bit about the need for a chair, insisting that he was a grown man who was very capable of walking.
John smiled; it was typical of Sherlock to contract pneumonia and not something simple like a common cold.
I apologise for any mistakes, all of this fic is un-beta'd and so it's likely some will crop up at some point.
John almost cried as Greg pushed him alongside Sherlock's bed, and he reached his arm between the bars to clasp the other man's hand in his. It took him a moment to recognise his fingers twitching slightly.
On the day that John returned to 221b Baker Street, he could tell something was wrong. He’d had no correspondence from Sherlock in the last 3 days of his holiday, and although he hadn't expected much from him, he’d received semi-frequent text messages throughout the rest of his trip.
"I know." He said between gritted teeth. The monitor beeping at his increasing heart rate was grating on his last nerve. Can he do nothing privately in this place?
“You need to focus on your breathing; your pulse is too fast.” He looked up at the detective. He looked slightly less flustered than he had earlier, but his eyes were still-fever bright as the movement of his chest slowed.
ECG - short for electrocardiogram, uses leads attached to the chest to produce a paper reading of the heart's electrical activity. Used to check for abnormal electrical impulses.
"I should have kept a better eye on him." He croaked, more to himself than to anyone else. "What sort of Doctor-"
"No, John." Mycroft continued. "You were unwell and I shouldn't have spoken to you like that. My apologies."
He vaguely remembered coming round after his panic attack, confused by his surroundings and disorientated. It wasn't a feeling he wished to replicate.
"Don't let them wake him up until I'm there." He said loudly, his voice hoarse still. "You know he'll panic."
Mycroft chuckled slightly. "It is not your fault, John. My brother always has known how to test us." There was a pause before Mycroft spoke again.
Passers-by gawped as they loaded him into the ambulance and John hopped in behind. He didn't even have the energy to worry about the press getting ahold of this.
"I have no idea how he managed to get himself in such a state, I was only gone a week." He replied. Chrissy shrugged, pulling on a pair of gloves.
Mycroft nodded a hello to David as he stepped out of the room, and John wondered how the man had got hold of his phone in the first place.
It was then John realised how tense he was, rolling his shoulders and relaxing against the mattress.
Hyperkalemia - a high level of potassium in the blood. Usually indicative of kidney problems, but common also in acute dehydration or following hypovolemic shock.
"Get better, brother." He patted his hand gently against Sherlock's shoulder and straightened himself, looking over at John.
The older Holmes brother said nothing after that, taking one last look over at the man in the bed before turning and leaving the room.
He opened his eyes fleetingly, greeted by another face he didn't recognise or the white speckled tiles above his head.
Shutting the door behind her, John peered in on Sherlock, who was idly twiddling with the ECG wires. John left him to it, as long as no harm was done he would let him get away with it.
Sighing, John left the room and eyed his coffee on the kitchen side, now stone cold. He pondered for a moment what might have happened to the great and powerful Sherlock Holmes had he not come back from his holiday when he did. Would he have lived through it? John doubted it.
The young girl smiled once more at John before turning and walking out of the door and down the stairs. John hoped for a second that she would not hurt herself, carrying something so heavy.
"That's it John, just take some nice deep breaths for me." David's voice, steady and calm. "You're doing really well."
"I've secured him a private room in ICU. You will have full medical control over his care." John looked at him, wide-eyed.
"I'm alright." The detective replied. The words were clipped, and John knew how angry he must be at himself.
"Mr Holmes requests that you keep him informed on his brothers condition, please call if you have any concerns."
"But we don't know yet. Chest infection seems the most likely considering the increasing oxygen requirement. He's going to discuss it with his registrar."
Eventually, John was given control of his own breathing again. The horrid plastic was taken off, replaced by something much lighter that sat over his mouth and nose. It took a minute to get used to, but it seemed to do the trick.
She leaned over to Greg quickly, and John strained in an attempt to hear her. Greg nodded in response to whatever was said, and she flashed a grin in John's direction before nipping out of the room.
John let himself relax once more, tomorrow was okay. Sherlock would probably be ready to come off the ventilator by then, so long as all was going well. He nodded.
John hung up the phone, leaning back against the wall and closing his eyes. His heart was hammering in his chest, and he focused on his breathing to steady himself.
There was a pinch in the back of his left hand, and a tickle under his nose. His eyes were the last to respond, and the muffled voices came to a halt as his eyelids twitched in their attempt to open.
John's nurse, Aimee, had been kinder. She offered Sherlock water and chatted to him about John; where they met and how they knew each other.
Mycroft had a gaunt expression on his face, anger and annoyance clearly present. John was slightly shaken, and let himself relax back into the bed slightly. His head was pounding, and he had to admit he was exhausted.
The guilt was back, and John rested his head in his spare hand as he contemplated the situation. He didn't even want to think about the worst case scenario.
The pounding in his chest slowed slightly, and he felt like his lungs finally had the room to expand. He took a few deeper breaths, testing the waters.
"We've started IV antibiotics, so he should improve as they start to work. His kidney function is dire, so we'll sort a referral to renal, and the respiratory team will see him as well."
He had seen men in the field gasp like this after gunshot wounds or bombings, but it was somehow worse to see the almighty Sherlock Holmes brought to his knees by rattling coughs and not enough air.
"You can't blame yourself for this." Wendy interjected, not looking at him. "You know how fast this illness can progress. His body is tired, he just needs some time to rest." John didn't reply, his mind frantic behind his quiet exterior.
John cringed as the needle went in, but didn't feel anything after. David was finished in a matter of seconds. There was so much information to take in, but John couldn't find it in himself to be too bothered about it all. He was well aware of the process of screening for sepsis, just didn't expect for it to ever be done on himself.
The feeling up his arm washed over him like a wave, a warm blanket that wrapped around his insides and pulled him back together again.
Everything after that was blurred and uncertain. There were flashes; bloods being taken and people talking to him, but nothing cohesive.
John shifted awkwardly on the bed as the electrodes were stuck to his chest, struggling to stay still whilst the machine took a reading.
As he made his way the few steps towards John's bed, small signs told John that the younger man wasn't yet completely recovered. He cradled his chest as he walked, his proud gait now more of a shuffle. He looked good though, and John had to wonder who he'd shouted at to get two chest drains removed and be up and about within three days of extubation.
John threw his phone across the bed and turned his attention back to Sherlock, who was panting heavily and  sweating profusely.
He was sweating from the fever, breathing quicker now than earlier. The two women introduced themselves, listened to his chest and had him cough as hard as he could. They looked at each other with frowns on their faces.
John pulled a bottle of paracetamol and some saline from the duffel bag and hung them both from the curtain rail, connecting them to Sherlock's cannula and stepping back.
John's brow furrowed, and he looked over to Frankie, who was observing the conversation with a hardened look on her face.
He must have drifted off again, because the next time he opened his eyes, the room was bright and Greg was at his bedside.
It was weird for John, seeing it from this side. He was lucky in a way, that at least he understood what was happening to him.
He was thankful when it was over and he was covered up, feeling vulnerable and exposed laying there like that. He sat silently and without complaint while the young doctor took a blood sample from the crook of his right arm, and then left him in peace.
He had no control. Every time he tried to take the damned thing off, hands held him down and the world went fuzzy at the edges.
John took a moment to check inside Sherlock's mouth; no blockage, and as he pressed his lips to his to give his first breath, facts and figures plagued his mind. He'd seen this kind of thing claim the lives of men much healthier than Sherlock, and the thought brought a tear to his eye. He swiped it away quickly as he breathed the first breath into his friend's too-still body. Sherlock's chest rose in response as his lungs filled with John's air, and then collapsed back again, empty and still.
John's eyes dropped, staring at his hands as the other man lectured him. It made him feel young and vulnerable.
John thought about following her, thought about demanding his right to stay. He changed his mind when he looked down at his hands and noticed them shaking.
John had started to despise that question. He sat and thought about his answer for a moment. His limbs felt heavy from the after-effects of the Midazolam, and he still ached something awful. His headache had gone though, and the room definitely felt more peaceful.
“I’m gonna need to examine you, Sherlock. Then you can have some medicine and go to sleep, yeah? Try and breathe” He dug around in his bag as a small nod from the other man confirmed he’d be acknowledged. John pulled out a digital thermometer, set it to zero and took Sherlock’s chin in his hand.
Sherlock's skin almost matched the colour of the white sheets around him, and metres of wires lead off his body to an array of monitors at his bedside. A tube that looked entirely wrong led from his mouth, meeting a green pipe and leading off to the ventilator. Another, smaller tube was in his nose. John approached his side somewhat nervously, eyes flitting between the man and the monitors above his head. It was nice to see him stable, at least.
A large man in blue scrubs entered the room, holding the door behind him. He nodded to each of the men in turn.
He pulled up another chair beside the bed, sat himself down at John's eye level. Sherlock had moped off while John was napping, mused something about needing a proper cup of tea.
Sherlock nodded slightly, his chest heaving unnaturally. John dug around in the duffel bag, noticing an array of items, bags of fluid, IV packs and the such. He pulled out a non-rebreathe mask and attached the tubing to the oxygen tank. Cranking it up to the full 15 litres, he held it over Sherlock's mouth and nose, securing the ties around the back of his head. "Deep breaths, Sherlock. This should help."
As always, thank you so much for reading, sorry for any mistakes yada yada yada, comments would be great! Xx
Nasal oxygen cannula - a device used to deliver small amounts of oxygen to patients (between 0.5 and 4 litres). Clear tubing that feeds into the nose via 2 nasal prongs. The other end connects to an oxygen supply.
Amidst the chaos, Greg had apparently made himself scarce. Left with John and Sherlock was Aimee, who'd perched herself on a small table next to John's bed. She was alternating between writing in her notes and looking up at the monitors.
"Don't be sorry, I'm just glad you're alright." He smiled, standing and taking the chart from Aimee, who held it out for him. He flipped through the pages quickly.
I found this chapter really difficult, I must have written it about 4 times before I was semi-happy with the result. Its super long as well, couldn't bring myself to cut it down.
Throughout everything, John was painfully aware of Sherlock's eyes on him, brow furrowed and mouth closed in a thin line.
"You've just dropped your sats a bit. Doctor Reynolds thinks maybe you've picked up an infection." Aimee said. She didn't look at John, hands busy at the fluid pump by his head. John recognised a bottle of IV paracetamol.
John and Mycroft followed the man along corridors that seemed never ending. The man and Mycroft exchanged glances which made John think they'd met before.
"I'll give you some time, John." He said, reaching into his pocket and pulling out a mobile phone. John recognised it to be his own, and took it gratefully as Mycroft handed it to him.
Turning his head, John noticed Mycroft. The older Holmes brother was leaning in the doorway, eyes wide and mouth closed in a thin line.
He returned a few minutes later with an array of bits and bobs. In his hand, he carried a small bowl of water; Sherlock noted it was chilled by the slight condensation on the side. In the water was a clean flannel, and in John’s other hand was two bottles of pills and a separate glass of water. He placed all of the items down on the small table by Sherlock’s head, shook two tablets out of one bottle and two from the other, and handed them to him with the glass of water.
He tried the door and, upon finding it locked, produced his key from his pocket to let himself in. Mrs Hudson was not to be found, and he presumed she’d gone to see her grandchildren, as she did most weekends.
“Sherlock, how long have you been like this?” He asked, laying the back of one hand to the detective’s forehead; far too warm.
"What's his treatment plan?" Sherlock interrupted the consultant's silence. He had no time for waiting around for the mumbling idiot to make an excuse for his actions. The damage had already been done.
"I know, love" John replied, sighing. He was surprised how difficult he found it to see his friend like this. "I just need you to hang on for just a bit longer and then you can sleep, okay?"
"Not right now buddy, sitting up is better for your chest and your breathing. Just bear with it." Sherlock nodded quietly, and John almost didn't hear his apathetic sigh. He knitted a hand into Sherlock's hair once more, scratching his scalp lightly.
It took over 2 hours for the crowd to dissipate, and even then a few remained. Sherlock had bitten down so hard on his lip that he could feel it beginning to swell.
It didn't feel okay, it felt like his entire body was on fire, close to melting point and not showing any signs of relief.
It was so demoralising, having people see him like that, especially medical professionals. John had to constantly remind himself that his problems were mental, not physical.
John repeated, the monitors screaming in the background. This was so wrong; breathing used, dirty air into Sherlock Holmes' body. It made John feel sick to his stomach, and tears stung his eyes as he came up for another breath.
"I'll be by in the morning, John." David said quickly, leaning over him. "I'll be sure to let you know if there are any developments with Sherlock, okay?"
Control is one thing that John Watson always strived to have. Sadly, it doesn't always work that way.
The other man's eyelids were twitching now, and John looked up to see one of the doctors fiddling with the infusion pump on the other side of the bed.
Sherlock scoffed. "I know it will, John." And at that John smiled, at least the arrogant backchat was something he was used to.
Sherlock looked nowhere else, gaze piercing into John, eyes scanning his face. His fingers squeezed back, his brow furrowed. He whined slightly in the back of his throat.
There was still a beeping in the room from the monitor, but it was quieter now. John was thankful for that.
The ceiling was bright white painted tiles, and as John looked down at himself, he noticed the familiar pattern of a hospital gown.
"What's that?" Sherlock asked, his eyes following John's hand as he disconnected the empty paracetamol bottle.
"That's it, easy. Try and breathe, Sherlock" John's other hand laid on his friend's chest, feeling his heart pounding from the pressure. The coughs seemed to last forever, and John found himself wincing with each gasp of breath Sherlock took in between.
His drifting was interrupted by chatting, and he turned to see Frankie talking to another nurse. He recognised her as Aimee from yesterday, and gave her a slight smile from where he sat.
It was a beautiful moment when his brain finally managed to discifer the noise into something he understood.
Sherlock's eyes were closed, and it took John roughly 3 seconds to realise he couldn't see the sharp rise and fall of his chest as before; 3 seconds to realise he couldn't hear the wheeze; 3 seconds to realise his best friend wasn't breathing.
He smiled slightly to her, the whites of his knuckles gripping to the bed rails in front of him for support. He couldn't worry about it; Sherlock needed him to be strong.
Picking the blood bottles up, he took them into the kitchen and placed them down on the side, turning them over in his hands slightly to prevent them clotting.
Wide eyes looked up at John, still glossy with fever and bright like a cat's. John smiled. As much as he really could get on his last wick, nobody could make John Watson smile like Sherlock Holmes could.
John scrubbed a hand over his face, screwing his eyes closed just for a second in an attempt to regain some composure. “What’s the plan?”
There was no response from Sherlock, and on looking up John realised he was asleep. He taped the cannula in place with as much tape as he possibly could and then bandaged on top just to make sure.
The tubes and wires were still in place, just as before, but he definitely looked brighter. The colour had returned to his face, and he was laid peacefully.
John would like to say it annoyed him, but Sherlock's playing sounded like home; warm and tangible and real. His eyes were flickering shut again when it stopped.
David continued, "He was severely dehydrated; needed quite a bit of fluid resuscitation. He didn't properly come round for over 12 hours afterwards." There was a small moment of silence as Sherlock digested.
ICD - stands for Intercostal Chest Drain. A drainage tube inserted through the chest wall and into the pleural space. Drains air or fluid from the intrathoracic space in the chest cavity.
He made as little noise as possible, his knowledge of the creaks in the left corner of the 4th step up making all the difference, John thought.
It took a few moments for his vision to focus, and yes, he definitely recognised the face in front of him.
"We're at Bart's. He stopped breathing." There was a slight pause while the older brother composed himself.
John closed his eyes and sighed, his heart lurching. "Guess that means I won't be out of here today, then?"
Another young nurse came into the room, helped Aimee to roll him and rearrange his pillows. John added a left ICD to his ever growing inventory, the thick tubing pulling at the stitches that held it in place. He succumbed to a wash at the same time, giving in to aid from the two women due to the weakness of his own limbs.
Up until this moment, he hadn't attributed the pinching in his nose to a nasal oxygen cannula, but now it was all too obvious, the whoosh of it tickling slightly. There was an IV in the back of his hand, and his eyes followed the tubing up to a bag of saline and a pump at his bedside. The rate, he recognised, was set to run as stat.
"We'll sort you out John, don't worry." She said softly. Her hand moved, attaching the fluids back to the IV port in his left hand.
When Mycroft Holmes entered the room, John hadn't moved an inch, head still resting on the wall behind him. Mycroft took a seat silently beside him.
"London Ambulance, please tell me your full address." The operator said calmly. It almost infuriated John that he did not immediately grasp the severity of the situation.
Looking over the monitors, John felt slightly more at ease. Sherlock's saturations were maintaining at 92% and his blood pressure wasn't too bad at 103/52, even if slightly on the low side. His temperature was high but John was hopeful that the paracetamol might take some effect. John noted that Sherlock's heart rate had remained high since he returned home, and was still hovering in the low 130s. He made a mental note to keep an eye on it.
John listened, flipping Sherlock's arm round and taking his hand, giving it a gentle squeeze. He found a vein quickly enough. "Sharp scratch, Sherlock."
His vision was blurring ever so slightly at the edges, and he squeezed his eyes tight shut for just a moment; a desperate attempt to regain some control of his failing body.
John almost didn't hear him, everything too focused to Sherlock. The man looked better, he had to admit, but it was still a shock to him none the less.
The next hour flew by. David talked to Sherlock about next steps in his recovery, and Sherlock agreed to cooperate with the physiotherapists and play an active roll in his treatment plan.
