“To be honest, I was just trying to get you to shut up,” John huffs a little laugh. “My head was throbbing with all the… yeah, I don't even know where to begin.” He is smiling but he looks lost. “You were making my head spin - past lives - immortality - I don’t know what it all means.” He is searching Sherlock’s face.
“I am a constant… but you, John, you are a mystery - an anomaly. Anchored in time. You live, die and are reborn…Your-” Sherlock bulks at the only words offered up by his mind;
“Ok. yeah,” John concedes with a grin, keeping his eyes resolutely on Sherlock’s face. “But, Christmas was a week ago and... as I recall the agreement was
“Right. Ta for that,” John lifts his chin with lips slightly pursed but it is obvious the insult has glanced off of him, failing to penetrate his armour developed from years worth of verbal beratings he took in the army. "We need to talk about this-”
"Oh." John sits forward again, his face going from bemused to somber in a blink. "Oh, I'm sorry… I didn't realise-"
He is a soldier and Stinson's Captain so he doesn’t say this. All Stilson really wants to know is if they need to be ready to move out soon.
I am here,” Sherlock retorts, lifting an eyebrow. These are the thoughts that often haunt him. So many of the things that those two monsters-in-human-form had done had been to entice, taunt and destroy Sherlock; was it not then his fault that those things occurred?
Sherlock shifts his own legs, perhaps attempting to disguise the bulge at his groin. He crosses his arms over his chest and lifts his chin.
Sherlock is absolutely quivering with fury now. He's biting the inside of his cheek to keep from saying anything, as he coils tighter and tighter, waiting for John to let the ugly truth spill out into the space between them.
He looks up at the cracked plaster ceiling for a breath before he brings his eyes back down; calmer, more controlled and slightly closed off. He wets his lips with an unconscious flick of his tongue and clears his throat.
” John lifts his hands, palms out. His voice is tinged with exasperation. “Sherlock. If we could just-”
Hopkins has not been privy to the results of the official investigation but the informal ones, undertaken by their colleagues in the pub, all result in one conclusion; Lestrade shot that man to save the Holmes brothers. He had put a 20 year career, his family and his life on the line for two difficult, enigmatic, eccentric men. Few understood why. Those closest to Lestrade, Donovan and Anderson, had refused to elaborate to the others. They either kept their head down or exchanged knowing glances. However, Donovan, the only other officer at the scene, had once confided to Hopkins,
Those raven-colored curls dance across John's bare shoulder as Sherlock nods his head up and down. John feels the urge to laugh again; the thrilling tickling sensation so at war with the intense agony of his torn flesh.
“Still out. Haven’t seen him since you left together around noon, dear.” She reaches down and picks up the long handled feather duster she'd dropped, propping it against the fireplace. “Did you two get separated?”
destined for some government warehouse. He is practical and strictly disciplined because he has to be. There simply isn’t room for indulging in delusions when the only thing standing between those depending on him and Death is his ability to keep his head on his shoulders and his hands steady whilst everything goes to hell around them.
John respected that. He did. He threw himself at women with a near pathetic amount of vigor. He feverently hoped he would be satiated with each new romance or sexual escapade. He told himself that what he felt for Sherlock was merely infatuation; the allure of something new and decidedly dangerous.
“Christ, just look at you.” John makes a shaky gesture and Sherlock looks down to realise his sheet has fallen down off his shoulders to pool at his waist. His chest is bare and, obviously, not
“What?” John asks, concerned. He looks down at the hand pressed to his chest, then up at Sherlock’s face.
John knows he is gaping; mouth hanging ajar, eyes wide as he tries to drink it all in, but he hardly cares anymore. Life has taught him that there is little sense in being so insecure in oneself that you feel that admiring the skills and talents of another somehow diminishes your own standing. He is what he is and Sherlock - well, Sherlock is a
“I know. I know how I feel about you. I have known for ages… but… can you just let me get my head around it a bit…” John looks off to the side at the wall of pictures and his face is lined with weariness, confusion and, perhaps, a trace of fear.
” He strides over to the wall that has photographs, news clippings and sketches pinned to it in that controlled chaos that helps make connections and unravel riddles for Sherlock's mind.
“No… that - that doesn't even make sense.” Sherlock frowns at the form of John, looking him over for some clue why he'd say such a thing and why he is wearing that infuriating expression. “Why would you let me?”
He ponders this as he lies curled up on the sitting room couch, glaring morosely at the strong, compact man lounging in his chair by the fireplace. The man that has never danced with him; never so much as made a rhythmic shuffle in his presence.
He couldn't face himself; broken and still desperately fleeing the full impact of Sherlock's devastating loss and deception. John simply didn't feel
In Sherlock's mind, thick fingers turn more desirous and twine into his long curls, grasping and pulling ever so slightly at the roots as if to angle his head for a passionate kiss. Bolts of sensation skitter across his scalp, down his neck and shoulders, to the base of his spine.
“Alright,” John nods, his hand slides along Sherlock's arm to grip his hand. He pulls it forward and kisses Sherlock's fingertips. “Slow, yeah?” John says softly, nodding. "However much time I have, I don't want to rush it. I just want to enjoy it - enjoy
not the idiot that couldn't heed a simple warning and steer clear of a campus-wide blackmail scheme," he throws back as an accusation.
meet you Sherlock,” he says with a genuine smile. Sherlock tips his head to the side and studies him a long moment.
I mutter, sighing and sitting forward. I begin to push papers around on the table for a distraction.
The hospital is the busiest Watson has seen it in the five occasions he has visited. Warm spring weather has ushered in another fighting season and a dust storm the day before provided insurgents with enough cover to secret homemade bombs along main travel routes. These have done as much harm to unlucky Afghan men, women and children as the soldiers that were the intended target.
“Place of recovery... they don't need-” Watson trails off as something in the chart catches his eye. He flips back and forth between yesterday's and today's numbers.
Sherlock wobbles on his legs and stares at him as wide-eyed as a newborn foal. John’s face softens and he almost giggles, his frustration melting away into fondness. It is strangely endearing to see this typically aloof and poised man so awkward and vulnerable.
“Mmmm. Thanks for this.” The voice breaks the quiet and is too close beside Sherlock; soft and intimate. It pours a warm shudder down Sherlock's spine, that radiates through him. Long moments pass; still and silent. Sherlock's whole body is thrumming with sensation; every nerve humming with the completely unwarranted anticipation that it is about to, for the first time, be touched intimately.
It's a liability. If she's following it, who knows who else is. Ultimately, it isn't worth the security risk.
John sighs and rubs at his neck. "It's just… not the same, is it? Paying people to look after you isn't the same as being cared for by someone who actually wants to because they love you."
John looks Sherlock over. He considers that he should be able to carry the thinner man down the stairs. As much as Sherlock might surpasse the more compact ex-soldier in height, John certainly has him beat in weight and with his solid muscle mass.
“Diana, a reporter.” Henry’s smile is wistful. “I'm her cameraman. She's brilliant and fierce yet, somehow, has so much heart - such compassion… and I can't help - I love her. She doesn't know. I don't even know if she…” Henry’s face darkens with sadness. There is desperation in his eyes. “What I feel for her - I've never met anyone like her and I don't think I can bear it if - I don't think I want to continue if she's...” Henry lifts his trembling hands and slides them into his shaggy, brown hair, gripping tightly. Frustration and anguish contort his features.
John pauses for a long moment, looking down at his hands. His face is dark. “Hurting someone I really care about, or not being able to save them.”
Sherlock blinks and shifts, his eyes darting from the stormy blue of John’s stare to the photos on the wall behind John.
"I did it." Sherlock lifts his hands to the table, fingers spread against the smooth surface to try to drain that jittering current of disquiet through them. The warmth of Hopkins palms as she lays her own over them and gently squeezes surprises him so much he finally lifts his head and meets her eyes. Her voice is sincere; too soft and too quiet for the harshness Sherlock has grown accustomed to.
John chuckles, leans back in his chair, and crosses his arms over his chest. "I bet you were a bloody ornery toddler - drove your mother mental."
Sherlock touches his fingertips together under his chin to try and think but can’t stop them from rubbing against one another and it feels better. He ignores the other voice, the stupid voice;
His tantrum leaves him panting and his face burns with the humiliation of it, but anger chases, hot on its heels.
Sherlock searches his mind for something to say. He can't tell John that he has never really wanted another. That the thought of most people repulses him and his personality takes care of the rest.
Seeing John’s expression of wonder, lust, and genuine affection has changed him. More than the addition of data or a simple adjustment in perspective, this is as if the very lens through which he views the world, and himself, has been altered - replaced. It's
Sherlock's mouth now feels strangely empty, with the lingering taste of John in it. The wet path John's fingers left on his lips when they retreated, now chilling in the cool air. The memory of the weight of those fingers on his tongue and John's body pressing him down seem to be enough to immobilize him into a temporary paralysis.
Sherlock surrenders to all the need and desire that has plagued him since first laying eyes on John Watson.
into his ear and it takes all his self-control not to shudder. The curse of an edic memory is that he has perfect clarity of every second of last night. He very much doubts John, with his alcohol-clouded average brain, is suffering the same fate today.
Watson sighs and closes his eyes. Though he tries to focus on clearing his mind, his thoughts drift over the events of the day and catch on those odd moments where something
John blinks at her, dumbfounded. She is acting erratic and John is only able to vaguely grasp fragments. A deception, a barter, and it has something to do with John... but she's not filling in any details.
” Sherlock steps closer, looking down into John's eyes and speaking rapidly. “Anger is a form of passion and a close cousin to the pure chemical and biological catalysts that drive sex. Logically, you only had sex with me the previous night because, under the influence of sleep, your conscious brain was forced to take a back seat to your more primal desires. You are a highly sexual being who would likely have had intercourse with
Unsure where I am, but determined to put as much distance as possible between Mycroft and I, I shove my hands in my coat pocket and start off in the direction that Mycroft's car had transported me from. I keep my head down and my shoulders hunched against the damp, walking briskly. As I scan the street for an entrance to the Tube, the whole odd and unsettling encounter with Mycroft runs circles in my brain. My instincts tell me there's something more to it; some purpose or truth hidden beneath the surface and only glimpsed in the gaps. My fingers flex inside my pockets, longing for the comfort of my gun, though it will be of no help in this situation.
John merely lets out a slow breath, shifting his weight almost imperceptibly. His jaw adjusts before his lips settle into a thin line with that slight curl at the corners that is always dangerous. It never fails to curl Sherlock's toes and flip his stomach with John's obvious restraint over an exquisite storm brewing inside him. If Sherlock plays all his cards right, he might just unleash it. A thrill of possibility shoots down his spine and crackles on his nerves.
John nestles his face into the curls at the base of Sherlock's neck, relaxing and sinking deeper into the body below. He lets his lips brush against Sherlock's ear and is surprised when he feels that body beneath him arching up into him with a low and needy moan.
“You forget, I was a soldier, Sherlock. I killed men.” Sherlock's image of John is standing beside the bed, dressed in fatigues, arms folded behind his back. He is not really looking at Sherlock but past him; strong and proud.
Lauriston Gardens is just as Sherlock remembers it. If anything the building has fallen further into disrepair. There is no police tape around it as he arrives this time and no one comes out to meet him. The door is slightly ajar and he cautiously pushes it open and climbs the stairs to the first landing. He looks up at the landing above and almost expects to see John leaning over the rail and looking down at him in his blue coverall, cane still in hand. He sucks in a deep breath and steps back when a different head pops over the rail; the silver head of Lestrade.
Sebastian is at a small table at the back with some clients. His laugh is that smug, malicious, self-satisfied chuckle of one having his fun at another's expense. Sherlock begins speaking before he even reaches the table, his booming voice drawing the attention of everyone nearby even if the declaration that
“Hey, speak for yourself,” Billy says shrilly batting at Gary’s shoulder in playful scorn. Gary huffs and glances at the camera with amusement colouring his face. Then he turns his eyes back on Billy.
“Alright,” John says. There's a tingling sensation creeping over his scalp and down his chest as if the whole world is rearranging itself. He holds Sherlock’s gaze with the calm confidence of a soldier; steadying him. “You'll do fine. I'll get you through it, nice and slow.”
bed.” Sherlock is on his feet and fluttering beside the bed in a mix of panic, exasperation, and fury. A blond head is settling onto his pillow with one handsome cheek mushed into the dark purple, silk pillowcase. John has managed to pin his hands beneath his own body, forcing him to do a rather unflattering impression of a log. However, his moan of obvious pleasure over the high quality linens is rattling on all of Sherlock’s nerves in a way that has completely untethered him.
” He gazes down his body at the man crouched between his knees, his eyes sparkling with amusement. He runs a hand through his golden hair, leaving it bristling.
Sherlock turns and casts his eyes around the room. He spots his blue, silk dressing gown hanging over the foot of his bed.
“You're not making much sense, John.” John snorts and falls back, recalling when he said something very similar to a drugged Sherlock… and wasn't
Sherlock steps back and John lets his grip slip from his lapels. They just look at each other for a long moment. Then John's look of stolid determination softens into a warm smile and he looks down, rubbing at the back of his neck.
"You've triggered him. He's not ready. Put him back." Says the foreign voice, but it's coming from Sherlock's mouth.
“I'm here, Sherlock,” John whispers reassuringly. He closes his hand around Sherlock's wrist and just holds it. Sherlock hums contentedly and after a moment his breathing slows as he relaxes further into John's side, head turning in to almost bury itself in John's shoulder.
of the likes of Donovan or Anderson,” Sherlock spits in an angry and wounded tone. “I would rather a clear enemy than a false friend.”
This is for everything, right?” He smiles broadly and there is such hope and love in his eyes as he begins to strum a soft, and slow, sweet melody.
Before Sherlock can snap back with a pointed comment, she sets off in a fiercely confident and sensual walk; like a lioness on the prowl. Sherlock glares at her. Then he jumps to his feet, nearly bolting after her when he realises she's heading straight for John and Mary. He freezes after only a few steps, realising he's incapable of stopping her without risking being seen by John.
of it; not wanting John, not ending up in his bed, not having sex with him, and certainly not enjoying it - craving it. But here they are and Sherlock will be damned if he backs down now. He glares down his nose at John in defiance.
Sherlock's head whips up and his eyes are hard and piercing as they focus on me and slice me up with laser precision. I don't know exactly what is behind that stare as he says, “You think so?” It is more statement than question.
Like a tickle that you want to be a scratch; something that might be pleasurable but is agonizing because it's
It's not that he doesn't have restraint. He has loads of restraint that is tested daily in living with Sherlock. That he has managed not to kill the man several times over, shows superhuman restraint. That he has managed not to snog the man senseless, has also been a matter of military-grade self-discipline. That these two powerful urges chase each other around on an endless loop, like a dog chasing its own tail, means it’s rare that John does not throw himself into bed with the full body exhaustion of a soldier engaged in relentless battle all day.
I level a stony expression at her, refusing to give an inch. After a few seconds her expression gentles and she smiles.
Mike... Best mistake I ever made I ever made, maybe.” John rambles. His eyes have drifted closed, but he's smiling. “Yeah, definitely, my favourite mistake, so far. You're... Um... You're…
“Aw, sure look it.” Her voice is intimate and her smile is bemused as she steps forward again, brushing something invisible from his shoulder and fussing with the lapel of his jacket, smoothing it.“You shut me out in the end, but you don’t hide as well as you think, Sherl. Heartache is something you can’t hide. Too big, that.” Janine’s voice has that too soft and sad tone. Her head tilts and she narrows her chocolate brown eyes on him. “Thought maybe I had a chance to turn you round.” She grins, looking up from under her lashes. “Always was a sucker for a hard case.” She sighs and leans back to look him firmly in the eyes. “Story horse? Be honest. The drugs, Irene, me,
“Home,” it says simply and reaches out its hand over the body. “Come along, Billy. I'll show you the way.” Billy looks up and nods slowly, taking the offered hand. A bright light appears behind the figure and then the figure  is beside Billy, looking towards the warm, pulsing light.
"Would you like me to-" John takes a hold of the bottom hem of his t-shirt, lifts it slightly, and tips his head to the side in question with a bit of a challenge.
John forces his eyes open. He can only take in a blurred vision of Sherlock leaning close; dark hair falling over pale forehead, eyes red rimmed and manic. John reaches up and touches his cheek, assuring himself he is solid and real. The cheek is warm and wet with tears. He lets his eyes slide closed again, holding on to that warmth.
“Don't be foolish, Sherlock.” He turns his eyes back on Sherlock and his mouth is set in a thin grimace as if he is burdened with insurmountable disappointment. “He cannot see you. You are revealed only to the dying or severely ill.”
An ache creeps through Sherlock’s entire body at seeing John reliving the trauma that brought him, broken and hollowed out, crashing into Sherlock's world those years ago. He feels the air forcefully ejected from his lungs as if someone has taken a baseball bat to his stomach and he dashes out of the room, needing to flee his friend’s openly pained expression.
He carefully slips under the covers and lays on the edge of John’s bed, facing him. He takes a moment to just breathe the scent of him in, to feel the weight and heat of him so close within the intimate darkness.
As if diagnosing a patient or solving a case depended upon his ability to wrangle the imperfect and inexact world into hard and precise numbers.
” She says shakily as they embrace again. “Well I shan't do it again. Can't chase me away, for all the good in the world.” Sherlock buries his face in her small shoulder, breathing in that familiar scent, like cinnamon and apple rum. The world, his little part of it anyhow, does feel good.
I lied. Not intentionally,  but edit and agonize as I did over this I just couldn't end it without this little bitty chapter too. So one last chapter after this, yeah?
“No… no, he's-” Watson lifts his eyes from the chart and startles because the young man is standing right
There are always patients to tend, lives to save, missions and drills and endless hours of paperwork,
When Watson gets word of such visits ahead of time, he makes every effort to find assignments that take him out of reach. Though the visitors inevitably want to shake his hand and have a drink with him, having heard stories of his skill, he has no stomach for it. On a good day he can keep it civil, but on
Sherlock blinks, startled by John's rebuffing.He is certain he was being obvious in indicating that his mouth needs to be on John right-
"Right." John nods, takes a deep breath, and his eyes clear as he obviously pushes back his own discomfort. Sherlock recognises the signs of him slipping into either his doctor or military persona; his shoulders shift back, he straightens his spine, and he drops his chin.
“I like dancing.” Sherlock keeps his words quiet and looks directly at John, measuring the impact. Ready for retreat back to safe ground should it prove to be some joke John is making.
John goes still for a second, then dips his head in a nod "Right. Fair enough." He steps closer. "You let me look you over and I'll let you solve
“Please.” This uncharacteristic pleasantry alarms Hopkins again. To hide it, she stands and speaks into the intercom at the door, requesting two teas.
“Knew you'd work it out,” Stamford says jovially offering his hand. Sherlock takes it warily only to be pulled into a robust embrace. If it is as awkward as it feels to Sherlock, Stamford doesn't seem to notice as he laughs and gives Sherlock a thump on the back.
"Oh," John blinks, looks away, and then his eyes dart back to her, narrowed in skepticism. “You’re a friend of Mary’s?" He is fairly certain he knows Mary’s friends and he’d certainly remember
“Sherlock you bloody berk, this isn’t how it works,” John growls, twisting and squirming as they tangle around each other like some complex puzzle. “Just stop-” The muscles of John's arms and torso flex and Sherlock's mouth is watering with a need to taste. He is trying hard to maintain his efforts but he can smell John's skin; overtones of aftershave, deodorant and shampoo doing little to disguise that fiercer and elemental aroma of adrenaline and arousal. A chemical cocktail that stirs primal things from their dark hiding places inside Sherlock.
The last time I'd visited her was several weeks ago. At the time, I was useless, broken, depressed, and slogging through the monotony of civilian existence like something unnaturally risen from the dead.
Sherlock steeples his fingers together a moment, his eyes narrowing on John as he does one last mental confirmation of the question he finds to be the essential staring point.
They know where I live (arranged it, in fact)… and, come to think of it, I'm not especially eager to get home and face Sherlock (since Ella was of no help).
Sherlock opens his eyes and studies John’s sleeping face. He looks like his is concentrating intensely.
There is nothing left for him to do to meet the insistent demand of his body but to smash his head against the ground. He manages to do so twice before that is stopped too and then an inhuman wailing sound is coming from him at the agony of the unfulfilled compulsion. He is going to be stuck in this chaos forever. His body and mind are screeching. It is killing him.
“Terribly tedious, but obviously they can’t work it out for themselves,” Sherlock replies, his agitation still apparent in his posture, his clipped words, and his gait. I’m having to practically run to keep up with his long, brisk strides.
The night that Irene Adler drugged Sherlock still looms large in the minds of both men. Sherlock struggles to know how to act on his new found attraction and, with the best of intentions, John continues to misinterpret his flatmate's behavior.
our housekeeper." I cross to her and hold out the duster to her. My set jaw and my flinty stare says that it’s time for her to
“Just tell the truth. You’re afraid I'm going to tell someone.” Sherlock feels himself plummeting with each awkward, fumbling, piteous excuse from John's mouth. He is sick with it. Sick with the thought of how John must see that night; some dreadful, regretful, mistake. Sick with how John must see Sherlock; some undesirable, inexperienced and incompetent victim of his drunken revelry. Sick with how John is taking this sacred thing and contorting it - perverting it by attaching his own ugly meaning to it.
have been living. You once asked me what my last thoughts would be if I were dying. I still may not be very clever but after I met you it was always,
Sherlock gives a slow shake of his head again. His downcast eyes drift to John's bare legs. John clears his throat. He looks into John's eyes. “It - It makes very little sense,” He admits with some difficulty. John lets the silence hang for a moment, as if expecting more, but Sherlock hasn't processed it enough to form it into words. Finally, John breaks the silence, pressing on, almost cheerfully.
It’s only when I see the flicker of tension in her face and the wary way she is regarding me that I become aware that my tone is too harsh, my jaw is clenched, and I am gripping the edge of the sofa tightly. I force myself to relax, draw back, and smooth out my features.
Once inside, Sherlock drops the handle of the case. He trudges over to the desk and leans heavily against it as he unloads the items from his pockets mechanically. It's a matter of habit. It isn't until he has completed the task that he realises he's not alone. He whirls around and finds John standing by the closed door, watching him.
Mycroft was sweating, abnormally white and leaning to the left. His left hand, meant to appear to be casually in his pocket, was actually pressing firmly into his side as a counterbalance to the intense pain he must be in. They discovered
Seeing that look in John’s eyes has crushed Sherlock. Every time it has happened, he's wanted to do something - say something - but he doesn't possess any tools to repair the damage. He was not at all worthy or ready for what John had offered, and there was not anything to say to change that, so Sherlock has said nothing.
From all I have witnessed, it’s clear that Sherlock does not trust Mycroft. The image from yesterday morning of Sherlock’s face fixed in icy anger on Mycroft offers itself up and I wonder how Sherlock wants me to deal with his powerful brother and what, if anything, they’ve said to each other
“This is a classic case of projection of guilt.” To provoke John he adds a dash of disgust to his imperious tone and emphasises each word like the sharp pop of gunfire or the hard, fast beat of an ominous crechendo . “Rejecting the truth of your impulses and the consequences of your actions by denying their existence in yourself while falsely attributing them to another as a means of avoiding accountability for your obvious shortcomings-”
He pulls himself up taller as he smooths over his jacket lapels. He pushes aside the memory of that intense look in John's eyes as he gripped those same lapels and practically ordered Sherlock to let him take care of him.
going to let this go. However, as his mind wades back through the haze of their interaction thus far, Sherlock realises that this is perfectly in character with the limited knowledge he has about what John is like when he's
When she bats her blue eyes at me and smiles, it feels natural to smile back. We talk lightly and I crack a self-deprecating joke about my choice of biscuits that she is far too generous in giggling over.
“Alright?” John has pulled back and is looking at Sherlock with warmth and an edge of quiet concern. His thumb strokes Sherlock’s cheek soothingly, back and forth. Sherlock blinks and blinks. Can't seem to focus.
” Sherlock practically chokes on his own breath, words dying in a strangled cry as John slowly swipes a thumb over the sensitive nerves surrounding his entrance.
I’ve no desire to have a row with Sherlock but, I intend to at least let him know that I won’t be trailing after him anymore.
“Rules are for idiots that lack the dynamic thinking capabilities to see any possibilities beyond those lain out for them in excruciatingly dull detail,” Sherlock reiterates his response from then. He really shouldn’t get sucked into replaying this old argument now, but John
“Right. Go on then.” Stamford gestures at the microscope where Sherlock had been seated that first day he met John. He hesitates, then walks over, regarding everything circumspectly. There is a note clipped on the tray with John's scrawled handwriting. It is clear he made an effort at his best cursive. It almost makes Sherlock want to laugh; the amount of effort the man went to and yet it still has the smudges of the blade of his hand dragging over it. The curse of a lefty, doomed to write a language developed by right-handed people.
…” His fingertips bite into Sherlock’s flesh as he pulls Sherlock closer.  “Mmmm… please, Sherlock.” He voice is fervent lust and his breath is so wet and hot curling into Sherlock’s ear. Sherlock shudders. How could he ever deny that voice
Sherlock's hand shoots out and his palm flattens against John’s groin, the distinct shape of his almost fully erect cock burns into Sherlock’s hand through the thin cotton pants John is wearing.
“The point is…” Gary says lifting his eyebrows at Billy in invitation for him to continue. Billy smiles back, still holding onto Gary's arm with both hands.
She quietly watches his show of rebellion against the truth as she runs her eyes over him; systematically cataloging the injuries. It is layer upon layers, new on top of older, on top of older still. Close to the worse sustained abuse she's ever seen. His once pristine, smooth, white skin is a smeared watercolor in the reds, muted purples and dull yellows of rotting autumn foliage. Older bruises of yellow along his high cheek bones have been splattered with the bright red of fresh punches. A deep purple circling his left eye is underlain with splotches of yellow from its previous damage, not yet healed. The slightly awkward way his mouth closes suggests a jaw fracture. The swelling and jutting on his left hand suggests a fractured knuckle, the pattern is one she has seen result from the hand being stomped on. His lip is split, teeth chipped and there is blood on the back of his head from being thrown against something hard enough to sustain a concussion. The slightly foggy look in his eyes could well mean it's not the first. His hair has been pulled out in clumps; different places over a period of several weeks. The bruises at his throat are layered as well. They have given him basic medical care, cleaned him up a bit, but it's clear that if this doesn't stop it won’t be long before she is dealing with his
There's some mix up with my army pension check. No one seems to know why it never made it to my account and they can find no trace of it. It's a minor annoyance that I quickly move to address. I have contingencies. I know I've enough saved back to carry me a little while whilst they track it down.
Sherlock is still feeling a bit shaky and all he can think is that he needs to shut both Donovan and Anderson up and make them go away before something awful happens. He takes a deep breath through his nose and is accosted by the same myraid of scents that are clinging to Donovan wafting in a nauseating wave from Anderson. Suddenly there is no question who Sally’s cheap lover is.
“...beautiful brain… hold onto something… please, Sherlock… Sex… love and care for each other… beautiful and wonderful…
A desire stirs in Henry to capture this beauty and share it with the world. It is so clear now. The universe is, in essence, a tragic love story. All its dark beauty; an eternal serenade that is echoed from the largest celestial bodies to the smallest atoms. The raw forces of attraction and the cold, senseless devastation inherent to existence.
She was extracted. A new continent, a new life, a new mission.” Sherlock glares up into Hopkins's eyes. “There's your suspect list, spent. Alone is what I have, D.I. Hopkins. I couldn't protect them, why should you expect they'd protect me?” His fury spent, Sherlock slumps in his seat, his head in his hands.
Sherlock’s eyes flick downward, and slowly trail back up John’s body with a sharp intensity. Warm chills shiver up John’s spine because
“I wish you wouldn't." Her voice is trying so hard to be encouraging. She must see my desire to delete the thing as embarrassment.
Something in Mycroft’s face tightens and then is forcibly smoothed over. “This is time sensitive and of vital importance. You simply
Watson freezes, his eyes snapping to the stranger as he goes cold with the shock of his thoughts being spoken aloud. "I didn't-"
John's hand is at center of Sherlock's back, steadying him, as he slips off the bed to stand beside him. It only remains for a few seconds more before withdrawing completely.
Sherlock watches him for several seconds, scowling, really - trying to process the odd way his own mind has gone muddled. He swallows around a thick tongue. Of course he knew, in theory, that drunk people are more tactile but he didn't know it was…
Hopkins picks up the smallest file from the desk, containing just a single sheet and the third file, the heavily redacted one that makes no sense at all to anyone on the force, and goes to interview Sherlock Holmes.
“John?” He isn't sure how to begin. John studies his face and takes a small step forward, tilting his head as if intrigued by what he must see as Sherlock's open expression of confusion.
What the text says is of little consequence. Sherlock has already prepared his reaction. Thus far the messages have been empty innuendos, lacking any substance. However, Sherlock falters a second, nearly dropping the phone at the timeliness of this particular text.
.” Sherlock’s eyes snap open and something seems to crack in his face; he is raw with rage and grief. He swiftly brings his fists up to the center of John’s chest and shoves hard. John stumbles back, the breath knocked out of him.
John is in a cozy living room by a fireplace. A picture of a young Sherlock sitting beside Mycroft, skinny knobby knees and both grinning widely, is visible on the mantle.
“I - I can’t think of anything I’d change about you,” John admits, his face flushing with heat. He swallows hard and tries to go back to reading his paper but he feels Sherlock's eyes on him in the silence, as if waiting for more.
“Wait. Where are you-” The door closes. I step back and look up at the lighted display ticking off the floors as he ascends. It goes all the way back up to the top floor where Sir William’s office is located.
“Sorry, what?” John’s anger falls away into confusion, his brow furrowing. He adjusts his stance. “I’m sorry but weren’t we about to have a row?”
Sherlock proceeds to launch into a veritable, ten minute long rant, pointing out each piece of evidence around the flat that points to Van Coon being left-handed. I try to get him to stop beating that dead horse about half-way through, but he goes on for another two or three minutes, just to show off. At the end of his tirade he declares that the only acceptable conclusion of all the facts is that someone broke in and murdered Van Coon. He was waiting for the killer with his gun because he’d been threatened. Then, seeming determined not to tie the last threads of the two cases together for Dimmock, and apparently being of the habit of stringing people along, he suddenly walks away and, with his back turned, starts to put on his scarf, coat and gloves
“I ruined your life,” Sherlock asserts as Lestrade relinquishes him. Lestrade looks at him for a moment, brows pulled together and eyes quizzical, and Sherlock wants to sink away. He can’t comprehend how Lestrade can bear to look at him after everything; the way he had failed them all and the things he had seen Sherlock do in futile desperation.
"RAMC." I look down a moment and clear my throat as the truth hits me again (as it sometimes does) that I'm
There is a choked sound that makes Sherlock twist and turn his head to look over his shoulder at his companion. John’s eyes have come to rest on the swell of Sherlock's arse and he appears frozen again. That heat is playing behind his eyes once more.
When Sherlock concluded, John found himself leaning forward and grinning at Sherlock’s back. For a moment The Game Master seemed stunned too, but then the darkness flashed in his eyes. He grinned and slowly clapped his short, stumpy hands together. He punched in two of the remaining numbers as he explained that Sherlock still could not save London in time unless he made the choice, the final choice;
As always, I get great encouragement from Kudos, comments and your thoughts. You can find me on Tumblr too as Breath4Soul.
John has two more buttons undone on his shirt and has made it to the bathroom door when he hears the loud thud in the sitting room. He hurries back to find Sherlock sprawled on the floor, desperately trying to get to his hands and knees. He has John's hastily discarded coat clutched in one hand.
I force myself to crawl out from under the table, but I'm not quite able to lift up from lying there on my stomach as if I'm in a trench rather than hunker between the sofa and table. It's been ingrained in me to stay low so that I can't be sniped, and the fact that no one is shooting at me doesn't seem to matter to my brain at the moment. I weakly manage to roll onto my side, head spinning and body feeling strange, as I lay there on the floor, panting and trying to slow the earth shaking pound of my heart.
“No. Not today,” Watson growls, glaring at the shadows. He gives himself a mental shake and turns away, marching to pre-op to prepare for surgery.
He decides he is certainly not going to try to get Sherlock out of his fine suit and into a pair of pajamas when Sherlock is looking at him like
“Yes and… no, I did not drug you and take you to some reenactment… that man that resembles you is, in fact,
“Yes, ok…” John chuckles and sits back, stroking fingers slowly over his chin. He's got two days worth of stubble since Lestrade has kept them busy. Sherlock finds it...
“Yes, John,” Sherlock breathes into John’s ear. His whole body is shaking with a fluctuating combination of fear, desire and anticipation. His fingers shake and slip as he briskly peels away John’s pants. He glances down and swallows another moan.
As so often the case with John, diametrically opposed is somehow, simultaneously, optimally aligned. The ex-soldier in John knows some battles are necessary and the doctor knows unattended wounds only fester. Both being passionate and high tempered men, an unspoken tenet of being able to co-exist has been to slice open and bleed the infection out of any wounds between them so they can begin to heal properly. They have always been quick to confront anything of significance.
“Yeah, no time for chit chat, Mycroft. We got ambushed by some Americans with guns. One man dead, three injured, police on their way… Yeah, I know, but Sherlock is in a bad way. Irene injected him with something… no, but I think he’ll recover... Right now, I need you to get us out of here… Alright, downstairs in 5 minutes... We'll be there, just make sure
Sherlock scrambles to his feet. He rips the dark blue dressing gown from the hook on the back of the door and wraps it around himself. The cool, feather-light brush of silk on his hot and sensitive skin makes him shudder. He is trembling and he can’t even begin to stop himself because the soft brush of fabric against his skin is
“Alright?” Sherlock doesn’t respond. Hauntingly bright and piercing eyes stare into John’s and John finds himself tempted to just stare right back. He's quite sure he could look all day and not get his fill of Sherlock's unique mix of beautiful features, but he's trying to be smarter about this encounter to counteract all the stupidity of their first one. Ogling Sherlock when he's supposed to be doing basic triage is definitely not going to help his cause. He clears his throat again.
Captain Watson follows his gaze over to the corner. The hair at the back of his neck stands on end as he tries to discern what is there to cause such fear.
Sherlock is up on his feet, pacing his room as soon as the door closes. It's impossible to stay still. There is a live current running through his veins. He has to think - has to move. His mind, consumed with the task of processing what just occurred, does not even notice his body going through the motions of dressing himself; pulling on the familiar armour of his clothes, his scarf, his coat.
He shuffles his feet, sniffs, and gives one last glance around, hoping against hope that something in the universe will conspire to stop him. It’s a terrible idea but really, does he have another choice right now?
of all people, and the self-proclaimed high-functioning sociopath knows himself to be eminently unqualified to be anyone's emotional support.
Sherlock doesn't have friends, really. He has people that tolerate him because they find his usefulness outweighs his abrasiveness. Irene, for her part, tolerates him because he is the only one intelligent enough to make for interesting conversation. He also happens to be a potential threat to her various schemes. She has enough blackmail material on anyone of import at Uni to live quite comfortably - everyone, that is,
I pivot and march towards the kitchen. His mission isn't mine to understand. I'm just to keep my head down and do my part. He obviously can handle himself and I'm to take care of myself.
My eyes trace his features as I try to patiently wait for those piercing eyes to turn back on me. He hasn’t so much as looked at me since back at the flat when he declared the need to go to the bank. As we make our way further into the strictly secured establishment I am feeling more and more out of place. His perfect posture and his fine, expensive clothes make him appear well suited for a place like this. I, on the other hand, feel like a pauper in the royal palace. In fact, I'm beginning to think he didn't mean for me to follow him here at all.
“Alright?” He asks gently. Sherlock blinks, turning away and visibly pulling himself back under control; his spine stiffening and his face smoothing.
“Spare me your righteousness. Virginity is an outdated social construct that enforces medieval gender politics and places arbitrary rules on a person's sexuality and sexual experience.” There is more bitterness and contempt in Sherlock’s tone than strictly necessary. “It is absurd archaic nonsense that is of no relevance.”
Her bridegroom, a middle-aged man whose previous young wife died giving birth to their third child, is furious and blames the Singh family for not allowing him to take the girl a year earlier, at the time when they had first come to the marriage agreement. He has threatened to destroy the Singh family both financially and politically if the girl isn't retrieved and relinquished to him immediately. The whole incident promises to throw the region into political upheaval.
The unseen figure steps forward and leans in so that it and Captain Watson are nearly nose to nose. With a furrowed brow, it listens to the Captain’s tumbling thoughts as it studies his eyes. He is looking directly at it but not really seeing it. The spark of curiosity burns softly in the man's dark blue depths while the lines of worry and confusion crease the corners of his eyes.
Sherlock runs restless fingers through his hair, anxiety tickling at his insides. “One would assume that to be so, yet, that would be denying the evidence right before your eyes. So,
“Woah. Wait.” John's eyes are wide in shock as he rises to his feet as well. He tries to reach for Sherlock to steady him but Sherlock flicks his hand away and shoots him a scathing glare. He stands straight and tall, with every inch of his expression screaming that if John tries to touch him he risks being struck down. John raises his hands in a semblance of surrender.
“Christ, was it me?" His voice is so heavy with despair, that Sherlock feels it as a weight in his own chest. The spinning, pushing, pulling of that connection is agony. "What  - what did I do, Sherlock? Did I-”
his mind offered dumbly. Suddenly it was about more than keeping his good friend from hyperventilating, it was Sherlock Holmes trying to drink him in and that, like everything to do with the marvel of a man, was something earth-shattering in its fervent intensity.
“Hang on, now. Sod that. I pulled that trigger. I’d do it again. And I’ll have you know that it takes more than Sherlock Holmes to ruin me, else I’d not lasted this long…” Sherlock looks him over doubtfully. Greg runs a hand through his hair in a familiar expression of exasperation. “Listen, you’re thinking all wrong. I stayed away from you both because that’s what they told me to do. Didn’t want to make it messier. It was rough in the beginning. They did their job and made it pretty hard on me while they investigated the shooting. But with John and Donovan testifying on my behalf, they’ve pretty much wrapped it up. Should be letting me go back to work any day now.” He huffs a laugh and shakes his head. “Can’t come soon enough, I’m driving the missus crazy, potterin’ round the house.”
“I shall endeavor to remind you, then,” Mycroft cuts in smoothly. “Mr. Nahyt was your charge. Predicted to depart from Camp Bastion Military Hospital in Afghanistan at 1am, yesterday.” His finger taps the page more pointedly. “Yet… I see he is recovering in post-op with promising vitals.” Mycroft pauses, letting the words hang in the stuffy air.
“It won't be easy,” the figure says with a grim frown. “You will endure a significant amount of pain and you may wish you had chosen differently.”
“Oh.” John blinks and looks down at the floor. There is an odd little smile playing on his lips. Sherlock doesn’t find it amusing in the least. It irritates him that John does. “I hadn’t thought of it that way,” John says to the floor.
“Give us some bloody cover fire, Stinson. We’re fish in a fucking barrel,” Watson snaps. A tall, brown haired medic breaks off, drops to one knee and whips his rifle around to return fire at the nearby hill.
how you feel for him, Sherl. You hide right in his blindspot. But he told me that, even if you don’t choose him, he wants you to have everything to be happy. That’s what
“Good.” In that single sharp word and the snap of John's laptop slammed closed, Sherlock has signaled his charge to war. Heedless of the danger and risk to himself, he plans to fling himself into the fray with the relentless determination of chasing down a criminal.
When he is done and John is all dressed, just as Sherlock found him, he stands in the doorway naked and shivering against the cool night air.
“Zero?” John repeats in a tight voice. He cocks his head to the side and squints at Sherlock. His takes in the subtle signs of nervousness in the way Sherlock holds himself; the rare, anxious mannerisms that means he is working hard to stave off a growing panic. John blinks three times and swallows down his own discomfort roughly before straightening his spine and narrowing his eyes on a place just above Sherlock’s right shoulder. He forces his hands to relax their vice-like grip around the edge of the tub that is making his knuckles white and his fingers ache. Then he wills the rest of his body to follow suit, relaxing into a calm attentiveness.
In the light of this new day, having been nourished by love and stripped bear by the gauntlet of truth, he feels reborn; ready to face the promises John had lain before him.
and the way there was a constant battle in their fervent encounters. It is all familiar, yet John is unique. Like a new flavour of chocolate with subtle variation that makes what is enjoyable even more appealing for its distinctness.
Forget the other stuff.” He scratches at his head thoughtfully. “Well, can't say I understand it all, but I guess he called in some favors - well,
“Oh,” I groan as I look over a bill for my mobile that warns of disconnect if I don't pay in 3 days. Another, for the last of my electric in my old flat, has final notice stamped on the top in red. I flip through the rest and find they all need urgent paying.
, and he had desperately needed to kill the pain before it killed him. He didn't mind that she only offered an artificial sense of calm; that superficial, dulled stupor was enough to hide from reality.
"You could do with one yourself," John points out sharply, gesturing at him. Sherlock's eyes widen with indignation and he takes a very precise step backwards but his gaze is still fixed to John. John bites his lip to keep from laughing as the absurdity of Sherlock hits him anew.
John chuckles, looking Sherlock over a moment with a cautious expression that he usually reserves for when he's trying to determine his willingness to enter a situation with inherent risks.
John's bedroom door flies back on the hinge and slams against the wall with the loud crack of a gunshot. A picture jumps off the wall and crashes to the floor. Glass skitters across the wooden boards behind the desk.
John can't look her in the eyes. He twists his hands together in his lap and swallows roughly around the tightening of his throat. He wants to say that hurting Sherlock was never his intention - furthest thing from it - he'd been afraid and didn't want someone so special to be relegated to a drunken fumble. In the end, what does that matter? He gives a small, quick nod again.
Sherlock twists to look over his shoulder at John, who has put down his paper and is now scowling at Sherlock with clear annoyance written across his features.
Sherlock yanks the door open. John blinks up at him. Sherlock has a sudden flash of perspective of what John must see.
“I can-” Sherlock breaks a hand away from the position John has kept him in to reach towards the drawer again.
Thirteen days before Christmas Sherlock’s resolve to not tamper with the already volatile situation at last breaks. It has been gnawing at him like a constant itch under his skin. He requires data.
John’s body tenses at the faint creaking of the door. He has been waiting here for two days, never knowing when Sherlock will return from his journey, but it feels like he has been waiting for this moment for a lifetime. His eyes eagerly drink in Sherlock for the first time since that night in the alley. Sherlock had been duller then; drained of life, like a zombie. A beaten bloody and broken shell of his former self. The eyes that now catch his own for an all too brief second have recovered some of that inner light. Sharply perceptive, they travel over him and, even though he has always felt as if the man could see straight through him, this feels
He’s just taken a bath and come up to his room to change. Having shed his housecoat to put on clothes he is turned away but whips around suddenly when he seems to sense Sherlock in his doorway.
“Where do you even get these questions, Sherlock?” John's eyes seem to sparkle as he looks over his own glass of scotch.
John’s gaze lingers on Sherlock. A small flicker of something, difficult to discern from Sherlock’s peripheral vision, crosses his expression. He licks his lips and clears his throat. He angles his body towards the door, apparently reconsidering his original intention to leave early to do some errands prior to his date. Then, he strides into the sitting room and settles into his arm chair. He picks up his newspaper and casually begins to look through it.
As I watch, the figure transforms and a violin is lifted and merges with his silhouette; pressed between his chin and shoulder. Heavy notes leaden with sadness, passion and longing sink down to the street, giving the ordinary world a magical quality. People walking by look up and around, trying to catch sight of the source of that siren call. The figure turns and glides away, the notes retreating with it.
"I'm curious." John does a half-hearted shrug. That strange smile hasn't left his face and Sherlock hates it - it makes him feel as if he's missed something or there's something he should be anticipating but can't.
Sherlock is frozen; everything swimming around him as his mind blazes with fiery pinwheels at the unexpected sight of John in nothing but dark blue, tight-fitted, cotton boxers. Soft, golden light flows across the planes of John's chest and strong thighs. Shadows curl around the cuts of his muscles and pool in the dip of his collar bone and navel. Sherlock wants to dive in and lick the darkness out with his tongue. He wants to pin this fine specimen of man to the wall, like an insect to a board, and study him in detail. His eyes trace John’s form, thirstily drinking in the wealth of new information, drawn to the one thing now hidden from his sight.
All of these are equally terrifying, which is why Sherlock spent the last month and a half (when he was supposed to be
” Sherlock’s voice is quiet but utterly flat; absent of any emotion. He doesn’t move in John’s arms. He doesn’t hug John back. He stays as impassive as when Victor was beating him.
“Please." There’s a pause. A soft rustling. The voice is lower, quieter, closer - almost a whisper. "Know you’re there - can hear you breathing, Sherlock."
“You've been staring holes in my head all bloody morning. Now you're ignoring me. I assume we are back to you plotting my murder? So, I say once again,
for anyone she sets her sights on. She's looking for some rich boy to make her a trophy wife; comfy mansion, credit cards, maids. Knew a rich boy, some heir to a banking mogul - well, knew what he
He sighs and sets the glass down; unfinished. He leans forward and scrubs his hands over his face, feeling the coarse stubble and wrinkles under his fingertips and palms.
Biochemically speaking, falling in love is indistinguishable from obsessive compulsive disorder in the brain. The destructive chemical cocktail of increased dopamine, adrenaline and norepinephrine coupled with decreased serotonin produces an overwhelming desire to fixate on one person,  hijacking the normal functioning of the brain.
“Have a seat, Sherlock.” Mycroft gestures at the chair opposite himself as he leans back in his own antique leather armchair. His legs are crossed and his fingers smooth along the delicate engraving of the polished wooden arms; the picture of calm control to anyone that does not know him as well as Sherlock does.
John looks over and finds Sherlock's brow furrowed adorably. He feels something inside collapse, which he suspects is his final defenses. Sherlock lifts his eyes to meet John's and his body grows more heated under Sherlock's gaze. He knows he has gone a shade redder. He shrugs; trying to remain casual.
A deep-throated, whimpering moan that was clearly sexual reverberated through the air. Sherlock slid down the wall, his chin tipped up and his knees splayed wider to accept the dark haired man pressing into him roughly. Muscles on the stranger's back and arse flexed as he moved his body harshly up and down against Sherlock’s.
Sherlock obliges with a deep breath in and out. John's studious gaze darts over his chest. He tips his chin forward and Sherlock does it again; a deep breath in and out. John continues to study his chest with his brow furrowed. When John doesn’t proceed with his account of the things that he feels he needs to apologise for, Sherlock prompts impatiently, “And?”
An irritating, lovestruck idiot who couldn’t resist fawning all over Sherlock even whilst he was supposed to be doing the
"There's no reason to fight this," he repeats over and over insistently until it loses meaning and just becomes sounds, like some ancient chant. It wears down my resistance.
“Sherlock!” Angelo comes bursting out of the kitchen, wiping his hands on his apron. “It’s been too long! Come. Sit. I saved your table.” Angelo ushers him to the booth by the window. “I have your favorite dish on order; your boyfriend’s request.” Sherlock clamps down on the automatic urge to object with
Sherlock lands near the head of the bed and a stray limb hits the lamp and tips it from the bedside table to dangle from its cord, casting wild shadows on the ceiling. After a few seconds of recovery, Sherlock flips around and scrambles for the drawer again.
Sherlock blinks repeatedly, forcing parted lips closed and pulling back on a cold, shielded expression.
It was right there in front of him the whole time - how he became this way - what made him. Looking at it through John's eyes he can see why he is uncomprehending and dismissive of friendship - why he doesn't understand love. He'd been raised in an ivory tower - a cold, polished, sterile world of professional distance and transactional, business-like relationships. It's all he has known. There never seemed anything wrong with his method of dealing with others... until now.
Then suddenly thinner, slightly rough lips are dipping in, pressing so soft and sure, thrusting against his own with tiny, almost innocent, sips and Sherlock's eyes slide closed. The familiar scent of John envelopes him and those perfect hands are against his cheek and jaw, clutching him like he's something precious. John pulls back slightly and, for a few seconds, little gusts of warm and wet breath caress Sherlock's mouth. This is not unlike the mouth-to-mouth resuscitation John provided during his panic attack. That is grounding in how familiar it is and when John presses their lips together once more, Sherlock flexes his lips; testing the pressure and trying to replicate John's movements. In response, a soft moan rumbles in John’s throat and it's dizzying in how intoxicating it feels vibrating across their joined lips.
I hesitate for a few seconds, certain that her observation is going to be something I won't like. Still, I feel a bit ashamed for snapping, so I dip my head in a nod of consent, eyes focused somewhere around her knees.
an idiot; so slow. Mycroft was already dead- dying - poisoned. I never saw a thing until it was too late." His fingers have turned into claws now, digging at the smooth surface of the table. "So, Hopkins, you see, I deserve
Captain Watson flops back onto the small, stiff bunk, and lets out a loud sigh. Beside him, Stinson lies sprawled on his stomach on his own temporary bunk. His face is turned to the side towards Watson and he can see his cheek is already starting to crease with how he is pressing it into the little, flat pillow.
"Fine. Yeah. Good…" I force a wane smile, unable to stop from glancing up to the corner as I carefully weigh what I say. "Busy - I mean, I've moved. Living in London now and doing a bit of…
“There’s only two reasons someone that young makes it to the rank of DI; nepotism or exceptional skill. One must assume it is the former since there’s no indication of notable acumen or luminosity in DI Dimmock. He is nothing more than someone’s nephew or brother-inlaw with subaverage intelligence and a conflated sense of entitlement and self-worth.”
“What happened? Did someone hurt you?” John slowly pivots around again, scanning the room for an intruder. Finding no one, he turns back towards Sherlock, looking him over. His whole body is trembling and it likely appears to John that Sherlock is in the throes of another panic attack. John relaxes his muscles as his mind clears a little of the fog of sleep and the adrenaline of a violent awakening. Sherlock can almost see it all coming back to him as he recalls the events of the day and that he'd been lying on top of Sherlock as a
Mycroft rolls his eyes to the ceiling and lets out a harsh breath. “Do grow-up, Sherlock! This childish rebellion is disruptive and others will be hurt.” Mycroft leans back and snaps his book closed with an air of finality. His features smooth to that cool calmness as he slips the book back in his pocket. “ The rules are for the protection of all. All lives end... Caring is
As the unit hustles across the unforgiving desert sands towards the awaiting Chinook, they move past a tall figure standing perfectly still; serene and untouched by the violence all around it. Its lean frame is draped with a long, dark coat that billows out behind it and dark curls dance over its alabaster skin. Its silver-blue eyes track the soldiers as they pass close to it. It is unseen to all but the young, wounded soldier on the gurney.
“Wasn't even using my dominant arm,” he remarks with a smirk. Sherlock’s eyes narrow and he tips his chin up slightly.
“Right. Of course,” John sighs. There is silence a moment while John closes his eyes again and tries to relax, drifting towards sleep once again.
It is the expression John wears when an idiotic criminal is about to make the foolish choice to try to run or fight, requiring the highly-competent and dangerous ex-soldier to reveal the truth of himself hidden beneath the ordinary facade.
. Every callus and imperfection and the variations in texture of those hands are burned into his mind with perfect accuracy. He knows the soft parts and the hard parts and how gentle yet firm they can be.
“Alright then,” John says setting down the book. His expression holds relief that the silent staring is about to be over. “Have at it.” John leans forward, elbows on his knees and hands clasped, and locks eyes on Sherlock.
“Heard of knocking, mate?” Victor sneered, his eyes cold and dark and his lips pulled into a taunting grin. Not relinquishing his hold on Sherlock’s wrist and neck, he moved to block John's view of him.
John tilts his head to the side. It's kind of sweet and more than a little confusing that Sherlock has gone from threatening to kill John to worrying that John thinks he's a killer. He's not quite sure what to make of the strange mix of natural ease and tension between them. It feels like the start of
John tries to shift up the wall away from the sharp knee between his legs, pressing up against his sensitive undercarriage, but the knee follows him so he stills. He lifts his hands to shoulder height, open palms facing his captor in a kind of surrender. “Least thought you'd be more creative ‘bout it,” John smiles
Sherlock looks up at John, and his gaze is drawn to John's lips. The sensory memory of those lips on his replays on all his nerves again. He blinks several times, then shakes himself, mind stuttering back online. He knows exactly what he wants.
Sebastian relents in whatever he’d been driving at and chuckles, clapping his hands together. He switches gears, becoming more serious. “I’m glad you could make it over. We’ve had a break-in,” he states, getting to his feet.
It is quiet for a few moments. John’s hands haven’t left Sherlock's body, but surely they are about to. So Sherlock tries desperately to trace the path of John’s thoughts and understand what may put this fiasco back on track.
A peacefulness settles over Watson at the thought. An end to the vicious, bloody, exhausting chaos - the unending war raging, within and without.
It isn't exactly comfortable, against the cold, hard floor, but John feels that familiar, calming effect of the world narrowing down to him and Sherlock and the comfort of being able to hold onto the most important thing in his world. He slips his arms inside Sherlock's coat to firmly wrap his arms around Sherlock's lower chest. The heat is
defend himself. He is a brown belt at Shotokan Karate and he'd already managed to subdue the boy once before when he'd first burst through the doorway. The boy had even had the element of surprise on his side that time. He could do it again, if need be.
“Oh, we both know you’ve already memorised that.” With an elegant flick of her hand, Irene snaps Sherlock's book closed, nearly catching his fingers in it. “Spill it, Sherlock.” Her tone is stern and she tips down her chin so that her fierce stare can be seen over her sunglasses. Sherlock glares right back at her. His face is heating and his throat feels unbearably dry, so he swallows. A coldness is sufusing his chest. Logically, he knows it's adrenaline, glutamate, and cortisol flooding his system; a natural cocktail in response to the threat of being exposed for the deeply compromised being he now is. Yet, knowing this does nothing to keep him from providing all the tells that Irene would need to know she's onto something. He can’t stop tapping his fingers against the table because everything in him is telling him to move. He wants to pace, or run, or tear his own hair out - or
John is talking to him. He nods without trying to comprehend. He reaches for John’s shoulders and feels the sturdy strength of them beneath his palms. Muscles and gravity fight as John pulls him up, up, to his feet and anchors him. For a moment the room swims; everything heaving, spinning, and fraying on the edges. His ribs ache. His body sways. His pulse thuds at his temples. John is there, facing him; solid and sure when nothing else is. His hands are on Sherlock's waist; curling around each flank to brace him. John’s shoulders flex. They could be dancing.
“Oh?” John seems genuinely surprised and dismayed to hear this. “Sorry,” he scrubs a hand over his face. “There was a party and drinking… Didn't mean to drink
Sherlock nods again, eyes practically rolling back in his head as John's hands take the path back up his thighs, arse and lower back pushing firmly into the muscle as if revelling in the strength and give. This is dangerous... So much more so than last night… but he can't think, can't move, can't hardly breathe. He'd agreed to anything if John keeps touching him.
Sherlock clenches his jaw and leans closer with eyes narrowed on John. "Are you purposely attempting to distract with tedious and arbitrary matters or can I
I hear him shift beside me. He exhales a long, slow breath like he's resigning himself to something.
"I… um"  John swallows, purses his lips, and rubs his hands over his thighs again as he tries to work out what she's asking. "Sorry. Don't want to be rude but I don't understand…” John pauses a second to glance around again, as if he might find some clue as to why she'd picked him up. “You… wanted
. Right to the heart of it, easy as breathing.” Her eyes hold a little heat as she stares at Sherlock. “And not just that... you stepped all over everybody while doing it. Especially Lestrade... I really respect ‘im - he looked out for me comin’ up… considered him a friend. Before John came along to teach you how to be human, you treated him like
“Please. Please. Please..” Sherlock’s voice dragging from whimpered plea to demanding growl at last sent John over, roaring and arching, emptying himself so deep inside that deliciously warm and tightly clenched body. The orgasm rolled through him in wave after wave of intoxicating pleasure. As his body crashed back to the earth, he collapsed around the thinner body, slick and sticky with sweat. He sleepily moaned his disapproval as that warm body moved away and he drifted back towards sleep, a blissful lethargy pulling him in. He vaguely felt cotton and elastic settle back over his groin.
When John pulls back again, they are both panting and Sherlock doesn’t even bother to try open his eyes. He feels sedated and floating just outside of himself; completely surrendered to John.
We all are. She just wants you to be happy. She’s a smart one too. Knows heartbreak when she sees it. You’d led her to believe John was dead or she might have done something on her own. Didn’t know he wasn’t dead until he did his performance and, well… it’s clear to see how John feels about you... She agreed to get you out of the flat so you would see the broadcast.” Sherlock looks down for a moment, thinking it over. Hopkins had seemed especially cheerful as they discussed the frankly uninteresting cold case this morning. When he had inquired about the source of her mood she had simply said she felt that
Sherlock becomes more rigid; relief and anticipation warring within his body. He continues to stare at the computer, only stealing a glance at John once he is certain his back is turned.
Sherlock flushes, stands up quickly, and walks to his violin. His heart is thundering in his chest, his head, his fingertips. It bursts out of him in the wild, erratic snaps of quick-paced music he plays.
at the time of the original incident, he presently appears to be aroused at recalling the struggle with John.
After a moment of letting things settle inside him, staring at John's steady, blue eyes, Sherlock finds everything ordered enough to force out the words he knows he needs to speak. He swallows hard but his voice still sounds gravely. “John, I would like you to know I remember what you said in my room last night.” It all sounds very formal once he gets it out there and that's probably not the right way to do it but it's a good measure better than sitting there in panic. He pauses and watches John.
"Up here." Once Lestrade is satisfied that John is properly suited he turns to lead the way. "What'd you say your name was?" He asks over his shoulder to John as they weave their way around the clusters of police milling about on the spiral staircase.
He starts to type and, for a few tense seconds, I think he might not answer. Then he replies flatly, as if it is the most natural thing in the world, “Of course.”
He steps closer to me, eyes flitting over me as if he's reading me like a book. "You get those often?" His tone that is quieter and more intense, makes me drop my hand and look up at him.
“My compliments to the chef,” Sherlock shouts. Angelo starts and turns towards him with a broad grin.
John hunches his shoulders and turns up his coat collar against the brisk night air. Shoving his hands in his pockets, he shuffles quickly along the pavement, tipping his chin down to hide the pained grimace creasing his face. His eyes scan the shadows; knowing he won't find what he is seeking there, but he is unable to stifle the need to try. The hair standing up on the back of his neck and the gooseflesh raised along his sides have nothing to do with the wet chill in the air.
“Ok. So you've found one word,” John laughs. He is panting and starting to perspire from wrestling with his surprisingly unwieldy companion down the first flight of stairs. He props the wobbly detective against the wall at the first landing a moment. Sherlock's large, silver eyes are blinking slowly and trying to focus on John's face.
John’s eyes widen and he feels a sudden rush of heat in his face and chest as realisation of what Sherlock is implying, given their earlier discussion, punches him in the chest. He looks at Anthea, who thankfully appears to still be completely focused on the little screen before her. He swallows roughly, then gives Sherlock's wrist a gentle squeeze.
“Christ, no. Just - shit- just hold on, McDonnell. Come on... McDonnell?…” Watson's voice drifts off and his hands keep moving, his eyes burning and the cardiac arrest alarm blaring its damning defeat. “Someone kill that bloody alarm!”
John has not expressed an interest in that sort of intimacy, as other versions had. That was something Sherlock had at first welcomed because the loss of John in the Victorian era (his name had been John Watson then too) had nearly broken Sherlock.
Sherlock thinks he will never be able to hear his name the same again because, in 18 years of existence, no one has ever said it quite like
John sits in a chair at the end of a narrow hallway. In the distance there is the rumble of the train. His face is crumpled in sadness.
I let out a breath and turn away as well, fingering the raised letters of the name Sherlock Holmes imprinted on the card in my pocket.
Sherlock looks him over a moment. It is so odd to see him powerless; broken. John did that to him; took this invincible demon and made him into a mumbling, sniveling farce. How could he not see it before - how pathetic Victor is? Sherlock's stomach churns as he steps in closer. He leans down over Victor and watches the fear fill his eyes. “You're right,” Sherlock says quietly as he palms the call button from beside Victor's hand. “I have it on good authority that I am…
