"Would you like some?" Dean shrugs and takes it. He takes a swig, and Cas seems pleased. Dean downs the glass. He's forgotten how much he enjoys apple juice. Dean sets the cup on the counter and looks over at Cas, who seems to be studying him.
"Nah, it's him. No preacher's kid has a right to smell like that though. Whoa, brother." Benny laid an arm across Dean's chest, and Dean realized he'd already taken two steps in the guy's direction without even thinking about it. He just smelled so damn good. Dean leaned back against the wall next to Benny. "Shit. I didn't even realize..." Benny smiled. "It happens sometimes. That's how Andrea was to me. Go talk to him, just keep a clear head, I don't wanna see ya hurt." Dean shook his head.
He's not going to be able to hold still for this and they both know it. There's another harsh smack on his right cheek and he cries out, biting his lip to stifle the sound, eyes clenching shut. "I don't think that's what you should be asking me for, boy. Try again."
In a sappy gesture that Dean decided he didn't care about he placed both his hands on Cas's cheeks, palm to cheek. "Hey. It's alright. Don't worry, okay? We can head back to my place and grab you some clothes to wear, for now, then we'll talk about it." Dean adjusted both their clothes as best he could, and grabbed Cas by the hand to lead him out of the cemetery. "What do we have to talk about?" Cas's curious voice was just that. Curious. Not judgemental or worried, just inquisitive. Shit. Dean had to tell him something didn't he? He hadn't meant to say that like that. "I'll let you know after we get changed man. Don't worry about it." Dean worried about it though. Shit.
Castiel raises, shaking with need at this point. It feels like every nerve inside of him is on fire as he rides Dean even faster than before. He sets a punishing pace that has him gasping even as his balls are tightening and his mind is screaming. Dean lets go of his cock and grabs onto his hips. Castiel’s unprepared for the shift but then Dean’s feet are planted on the bed and he’s lifting Castiel with the force of his thrusts.
The man thrusts his hand out after his eyes meet Dean's again, and he takes it without thinking about it.
"Yeah. Had to get rid of the evidence. And honestly, it was either that or a murder spree. I thought arson was a better option."
of explanations, but it wasn’t his job to police someone else’s feelings. Another day after that and Castiel is down off his high horse. He never should’ve told Dean like that, especially while he was drinking. That just made things so much worse. Castiel is now depressed and regretting his drunken stupor of the last several days. Stubbled, hair unwashed, and clothes stained, Castiel does the only thing he can think of. He goes to visit Cain.
Cas nods and shrugs dismissively. "I've been waiting for that, to be honest. Any excuse to hit John Winchester is a good one for me."
He pops three pills into his mouth and chugs a swallow of water down after them, rubbing his temple. He grips the steering wheel with one hand and the other fiddles with the radio dial. The parking lot to the CVS isn't very busy, so he's just sitting in a spot, trying to figure out what's bothering him about this morning. He knows it's what Dean isn't telling him, but he doesn't understand why it's irritating him so much. He's quite used to there being a modicum of privacy in all his relationships, personal or otherwise, so why is it that Dean's insistence on silence is nagging at him like a sore tooth?
"Cas, I don't really have that many people you need to worry about. Sam already knows I'm out, and as long as I'm happy, he won't care. My friends... They're good people. I wouldn't consider them family if they weren't. They're not gonna care. Besides, it's not like you're wrinkled and bald yet, E.T. It is way too early to be talking about shit like this. Topic change?"
Having talked himself out of his negativity as best he can, Dean pulls the key out of the Impala's ignition and is now officially parked in Cas's driveway. He takes a deep breath, reminding himself that he's got this. If Dean doesn't like it, it's not like Cas is going to throw him out or something. He told Dean that.
Dean stiffens in his arms. The rigidity of his spine against Castiel only confirms what he already knew. Dean's trying to run away from something. Castiel wraps his left arm around Dean and nuzzles his neck, making him relax a little. "Don't do that. It's not the end of the world, you know."
Dean opens his eyes and looks down at Cas for a moment, feeling like the king of the world, and then lowers himself backward. Inch by inch, Cas's thick cock fills him up, and the only sound in the room is Dean's panting and Cas's quiet groan when Dean's ass settles firmly against his legs. God, it feels so deep this way. He looks up at Cas, not missing the affection in that gaze, and ever so slowly grinds his hips in a dirty circle that makes Cas grab his hips again. And why the fuck is Cas still in a t-shirt? He doesn't know why that just now hit him, but it did.
The phone rings and Dean quickly slides his thumb across the screen to answer it. Cas's deep voice now fills the relative silence of his bedroom.
Cas sighs and leans into Dean, and Dean feels hand slides around his waist then grasp his asscheeks, squeezing lightly. Dean gasps lightly, enjoying the feel of Cas's hands on him. "I would like that, Dean. It's very okay with me." Dean grins.
He hoped he wasn't making a mistake. "Yes. I would like to stay." Dean was frozen for a moment in shock but then he let out a whoosh of breath and his face melted into a smile. "Thank Chuck for that." Castiel was confused. What kind of expression was that? Dean must've noticed his confusion because he suddenly had what seemed to be an "Oh, shit." moment. That was really the only way to describe it. That was an odd reaction. "Thank Chuck?" Dean just shook his head. "Don't worry about it. Come here."
Alarm bells are going off in Castiel's mind at Dean's words. He locked the door. He always does. But- "How did you find me?"
Dean shakes his head as he pushes on the bed to stand up then sit down on the cover. He's not going to lie to Cas, and Dean knows if he doesn't say anything, it's just going to eat him alive. Cas's footsteps start coming down the hallway, and Dean looks up at the doorway until he appears, clutching the pacifier in his fist. Cas walks over and sits on the bed, carrying his phone in hand. He kisses Dean on the cheek and gives him a bright smile, and Dean gives a strained semblance of one in return.
He leans forward and presses a kiss to Castiel's lips. When he pulls away, Castiel says, "Sassy boy."
Castiel walks back over to Dean and begins to loop the rope around his thighs without warning. He wraps it around and pulls it through the hole in the wall, skillfully tying a slip knot. He repeats on the other side and mentally chastises himself for not having a camera on hand.
Knowing he doesn’t mean if Castiel is truly apologetic or not, he nods. Dean breaks out into the most gorgeous smile. And that’s why the ancients worshipped the sun, Castiel thinks. He's beautiful.
Dean's mouth falls shut with a click of his teeth snapping. It wasn't an order, but he still doesn't want to fuck anything else up. They were having such a good day too. "Dean, look at me."
"Yeah. They're mostly dicks, too, so don't get your hopes up about fluffy wings and harps and clouds and shit. They're pretty much all  bastards."
"I've heard about you as well. I'm pleased to meet you." Castiel retracts his hand and looks around. "You have a nice place here."
She thinks about it before answering, "The only thing I can think of is this; medicine is not a cure-all. It can help whatever chemical imbalances or issues that might there. But it isn't going to fix any emotional trauma," She looked at Dean sympathetically, "I don't want you to be expecting magic. We do offer therapy services and an array of groups and classes here at the center. I run a group therapy on Mondays, and I'm also available for one on one counseling if that would be something you're interested in. They could help further."
"Dean? Are you with me, baby boy? Come on. Open those eyes for me. Ahh, there you are." The first thing Dean sees is Cas's bright smile, and he just wants to kiss it, so he does. They lock lips slowly, and the slide of tongues is sensual and almost stupidly sweet at this point, considering Dean has Cas's fingers in his ass. Speaking of which - Shit! Dean pulls away from Cas with a gasp, rocking back on his fingers, shuddering. "C-C-Cassss."
"I mean, only that since we are "getting to know each other" that we actually do so. I don't have a claim on you since we are not dating. Yet. But I would like you to remain single if it isn't too much to ask. I don't play with other's toys."
Dean sits up and drags himself into the bathroom so he can shower. He wiped off last night, but he still has lube and sweat dried on him, and it's gross. When Dean gets out, the bathroom is steamy and hot. He dries and dresses as quickly as he can. Dean makes his way to the kitchen, phone in hand. He makes himself a bowl of cereal because he's feeling lazy this morning and checks his phone.
Dean throws his jeans in the vague direction of his duffle bag where it's sitting on the floor. It's been a long damn day, but overall, it wasn't too bad. Sam has apparently hooked up with someone, so he has a separate room on down the way. Dean's kind of relishing having his own room for once. Jeez, he can't even remember the last time it'd happened. And he has plans tonight. He's made sure the door's locked, and the curtains are drawn before taking off his boxers. Now he's naked. It feels good to just walk around in his own skin without being worried about anyone seeing him. He stretches, reveling in the silence. For once, it isn't too silent for him. He shuts the light off, leaving the bathroom light on so it can cast a little yellow glow into the room, not that he needs it, really. He grabs his lube off the nightstand and throws it on the bed. He is so not getting under these covers naked, who the hell knew what had been there, so he just lays on top of them.
His eyes refuse to open, but he doesn’t care. Dean’s surrounded by warmth and comfort, and he can feel arms wrapped around him. Deep breath... It's Cas.  He’s holding him. A small smile graces his lips as he feels Cas kiss his forehead, and Dean stirs a little, wincing at the soreness in his muscles, which aren’t bound any longer. He barely remembers the aftermath. Cas got him down; Dean was shaking and shivering with the cold of the sweat drying on his skin, and he remembers not being able to stop the whimpering. It just kept happening. They kept escaping with every jostle of his body and every movement. He should feel embarrassed about that. Dean thinks back to the orgasm he had, about what he experienced being in full submission like that to Cas.
After he's got all the ropes off, Dean is swaying on his feet. Castiel quickly hauls him up -"Up, Dean," - sweeping him off his feet, so to speak. He intended to carry him bridal style, but Dean grabbed his neck and scrambled into a different position. Dean's wrapped his arms around Castiel's neck, buried his face into his throat, and wrapped his legs around his waist. Castiel stills for a moment, a hand pressing reassuringly against naked skin at Dean's lower back.
"I supposed I could help you a bit further. I could assign a security detail for you and Dean. Keep you both safe."
What the hell- All the blood rushes out of Dean's face. Cas has been hearing him say his name. When he... masturbates.
Cain makes a noise of understanding and turns his watch around and round his wrist, pursing his lips. The dark blue suit he's in looks expensive, and it looks good on him. Castiel's glad to see there's no attraction left there anymore. Just respect, friendship.
There's a hushed whisper of feet on the smooth wood floor and Dean looks up, heart beating so loudly he can hear the blood pulsing in his ears. It's like his entire world is frozen in crystalline glass, ready to shatter. Please be Cas, he prays to no one in particular. Then Castiel James is rounding the corner.
There’s no answer or even a sign that Dean heard, and Castiel has no idea why. Not one to be particularly tactful, he steps inside the shower behind Dean and closes the curtain. Dean is still facing away from him, just letting the water beat down over him and not moving in the slightest. He extends his arm out, and when his hand touches Dean’s heated skin, there’s no response. “Dean, what is it?”
He sighed lightly, making sure Zachariah didn't hear him and continued to follow him. Zachariah had begun speaking again, and this time Castiel focused on it if only so he wouldn't be caught off guard again. "Nothing but maggots, Castiel. Nothing but a plight of worms on the bright word of Christ. These very people you see now, the same people that run these shops and stores, they are nothing more than putrid sacks of sin and debauchery. We must cleanse them. It is God's intention and his plan that they are expelled from the Earth through the Apocalypse, but we must try to make them see the light. They are unworthy and it is an ugly, disgusting task, but it is ours."
"The bedroom will be fine." Dean nods and sets off to do that. He loves the way this house is set up, seriously. Dean shakes his head at himself and puts his duffle bag on the floor next to Cas's bed. Dean takes a deep breath, then turns and walks back to the kitchen. Dean can hear Cas moving around in there. As he enters, he finds Cas at the counter, pouring some juice. He looks up with a small smile, offering Dean the glass of apple juice.
He reaches out and strokes Dean's stubbled cheek gently until he looks up and meets his eyes. "I'm here. I'm sorry I hurt you. I'd really like to know what it is that's bothering you. If that's alright."
Dean had to repress a shiver. Cas cussing did things to him. "Well, let's see, there was this one bastard that tried to force me to become Michael's vessel so he and his cronies could start the Apocalypse. Then there's Balthazar. He was an absolute asshole, but he did alright in the end I guess. And Gabriel, pretty much the same thing. He trapped me and Sam in... I really don't know how to describe it, but it was a world that basically reset itself everytime I died. Sam watched me die over and over again, hundreds of times, man, reliving the same day over and over. Only to prove a point."
Everything has been hurting. Just aching inside and Castiel hates it. His life used to be so simple. Now everything was complicated and painful. He loves Dean, he does, but Castiel can’t handle this right now. Everything about their relationship is so incredibly mercurial. Every time someone sets a boundary or makes a rule it gets broken, or ignored, or pushed past. They’re so wrapped up in each other that they forget the real world. Castiel’s fallen behind in his work, so has Dean. They’ve both put off chores, and responsibilities for more time with each other. In a perfect world, that’d be fine, but Castiel can’t let his life fall apart over one person. Nothing ever stays the same with them and Castiel can’t handle all of the emotional fallout every time. They’re too new to be going through things like this. Everything’s been so shitty and hard since John came into the picture. Before that… Before that, it was perfect.
Despite the fast pace of his heart and his sweaty palms, he hesitantly takes Cas's hand and lets him lead him towards the first hive. As they get closer, the buzzing gets louder, and Dean brings his right hand up to wipe his forehead since Cas has his left. He does not want to get attacked by a million bees.
He was horrified. Why would someone like Cas- Fuck. Cas looked so damn apologetic it was ridiculous. "I'm sorry, Dean. I didn't mean to be this much trouble."
Cas regularly donates to a charity for children's cancer research, his sister Anna was hospitalized for gunshot wounds, and Dean has a feeling he knows how that happens. He publicly denounced Luke and his actions. He rallied against Luke's campaign of terror. Cas is a good guy. Dean knows this. He can feel it. His stomach feels fluttery and he's seriously wondering if he's going to vomit or not.
"Oh, baby boy, you're going to cum for me again." Dean starts to protest but- "Yes, you can. I promise. Trust me."
That returns Castiel to his mindset, and he reminds himself that Dean is vulnerable right now. He can't get shocked by the things Dean might do right now. He can't show Dean that because he'll misinterpret it. Castiel pushes him up on his body and shifts him a little, then nuzzles his face into Dean's neck.
Dean's eyes burn as they scan the screen with hawk-like intensity, raking over the raging, blinking little words on the screen. He can't even think. Everything is frozen.
A sound falls out of Dean's mouth that has Castiel's erection straining upwards, and he's nearly ready to break and take the plug out and shove himself inside. He loves being in Dean's ass. But he's waiting for something, it should be coming sometime soon.
Castiel's snap open, searching the darkness for the noise that woke him. Whimpering, harsh, wounded noises of some injured animal. Castiel rubs his eyes with the heels of his hands and sits up. The darkness is thick, and Castiel can't really see anything. It's late, probably the middle of the night since he and Dean went to bed late.
"A little. It's nothing bad. I imagine your foot has it worse," Cas says, grunting a little as Dean finds his way up under Cas's boxers. Dean chuckles and wraps his hand around Cas's cock loosely and begins to tug gently, not enough to chafe. Every swipe of tongue against skin is an
Cas leans over, and Dean can feel his warm breath on his neck. "Do you think I did not enjoy this morning? Do you think I wasn't happy you asked?"
. Dean keys the ignition and the smooth rumble of Baby's engine filled the air. He grips the steering wheel and turns to look at Cas who's looking at the floorboard dejectedly. "I'm sorry, Cas. We can come back another day, okay?" Cas just nods and mumbles, "Yes, Dean."
Dean's cheeks redden, and he whines at the words. He wants it now! Cas chuckles and removes his fingers, making Dean whine again. He feels so damn empty.
Dean visibly relaxes, and Castiel shakes his head. How did he get so lucky? His middle finger slips inside, and Castiel revels in the little whimper. He begins to thrust his finger in and out slowly, working Dean open until he can add another. Without warning, Castiel curls his fingers at just the right depth and rubs against Dean's prostate. His boy's back arches away from the wall and keens loudly.
He sighed almost inaudibly and Dean gave a small chuckle. "Sorry. A side effect of blood loss. Sleep. I've got ya. Sleep, Cas." Castiel was out before the words were even finished, he was just so tired all of a sudden.
They ate and hung out. Cas showed Dean his beehives and his garden, both of which had been cooler than he would've thought they'd be. They'd even played a board game, which Dean had won, then Cas had challenged him to a game of Twister, which had not ended well for Dean. Being that close to Cas, and at some points being wrapped around him, had been terrible for his libido. He'd had to excuse himself a couple of different times to go calm down. Cas had just smirked knowingly and let him.
"Umm," Dean looks at Cas, eyebrows drawn up in confusion, but Cas isn't paying attention. He's looking at the pacifier with a fond look that kinda makes Dean sick to his stomach. Well, no, it's not the look that has his stomach roiling around like an ocean storm.
Castiel is torn. He should respect the request, but he doesn't think that leaving Dean alone is the smartest thing to do. It seems callous and uncaring. Instead, he decides to try to figure out what happened. “Is this about yesterday?”
"Well, thanks, but did you really just ask me what I do for a living when I'm literally working right now?"
The room, thankfully, is quieter than the rest of the club. The walls are probably padded but the rich oak panels reveal nothing. A long time ago, Castiel used to tease Cain about his "mancave" of an office. The carpet is thick and a deep red umber. All the accents in the room are dark wood and gold gleams. It ties well together.
Castiel hates it. He hates talking to strangers and trying to convince them they are making mistakes and sinning when he himself doesn't believe it. He hates pointing out their supposed wrongs as if he has no faults of his own. He hates the way Zachariah and almost the entire church feel they know best and makes it their personal missive to correct others, others who don't even believe in their god. Sin or not, he's envious of all these people. They get to go out and have fun, and not have to worry about their cruel step-father breathing down their neck over every single misstep. They are free. Free in a sense that Castiel has never experienced and it's never weighed on him so much as it is now. He's exhausted, they've already been doing this for hours and it's just the same as it is every year.
Dean nods, "I'd never turn down Cas's cooking," He turns to Cas then, "Are you thinking tonight or tomorrow?"
"Sorry, sir." He mumbles quickly, instinctively clenching down on the finger that's starting to move inside him. It thrusts back and forth slowly, completely avoiding anything fun, but it still feels pretty good. Then another slick finger slips inside. After a few moments, so does another. "Oh fuck, Cas. Sir - Sorry. Please. Please, feels so good." Dean babbles and Cas chuckles darkly. "You sound so pretty begging for me, baby boy. Do it some more. Maybe I'll let you cum on my fingers. How does that sound?" It sounds like
A few moments pass in silence, and Dean starts to get a little uncomfortable under the scrutiny, and he shifts around in his seat. Cas seems to know he's uncomfortable because he drops his gaze and looks down at his phone with a curious glance.
"Lube first," Cas reminds, and Dean hears the click of the cap but can't see Cas's hands since they're behind his back. Then lube-wet fingers are slicking up his hole, making him bite his lip as he looks down at all of Cas's sexy, dark stubble, and bright eyes. Dean leans down as Cas's fingers plunge into his hole. Dean kisses those plump pink lips, licking them open and thrusting his tongue inside with the same rhythm that Cas is using with his fingers, and Cas groans into his mouth. Cas's left hand slides up his side and into Dean's hair, pulling his head back forcefully. Cas attacks his throat, licking and sucking along his stubbled jaw, then biting at the meaty connection between his shoulder and his neck. Dean moans, trembling under Cas's ministrations.
"No, not always. It depends on the case. But this is a mental health clinic, so if I think the patient would benefit from being able to talk to their doctor anytime, then I do."
Especially from strangers. Though... Dean didn't precisely qualify for that. Castiel had wanted to be owned by Dean, that's why he had made him bite him. Castiel had wanted the mark, though now that he was thinking about it he couldn't exactly remember why he had had such a blinding urge to be bitten. That was a little weird actually.
It was useful to the nth degree honestly. "She's beautiful, Dean." Dean's small smile amped up to about a thousand degrees of dazzling dental brightness at that. Cas literally could not have chosen a better thing to say even if Dean had given him a script. "Yes, she is. This is Baby. 1967 Chevy Impala. She rolled off the line a pure smokin' babe, and I've kept her that way." Cas turned and smiled at him.
"You don't like being vulnerable and asking for things you want." It's not a question, so Dean doesn't bother to answer with anything but a soft 'yeah.'
"I mean, yeah, probably." Dean shrugs it off, "If he was drunk. I don't think he would if he were sober."
Interesting factoid: Zulu was a mute comic book character from a series that was popular in the 1940's. Dean makes pop culture references NO ONE understands, I guess. Mostly cuz I suck at references, sorry. :) Enjoy.
" The pleased growl he gets in response is almost drowned out by his scream when Cas thrusts inside him in one push, bottoming out in the first stroke.
Fun story: One time my partner and I were kissing in our car outside of a rest stop and an old woman knocked on our hood and gave us a thumbs up and a huge grin. I have no idea if that was in support of us being lesbians, or if she was just a voyeur, but I prefer to believe the more wholesome one. It was funny enough to include here. I hope you guys enjoyed the chapter! <3
The blinds on the door rattle against the wood, and Castiel takes a moment to look around, vaguely noticing a bookshelf, a desk, and a window before Dean is on him, pushing him against the wall, "Where are we?"
"Dad, stop it!" Sam yells. Dean only hears it distantly. Everything in the world has slowed to a crawl and it's like Dean can see his entire childhood laid out in front of him. Every hit and every night spent lying awake wondering what he'd have to do to keep food in their bellies. All of the abuse and every bit of neglect. All the tears, all the pain, all the hatred. It rises within Dean like a blazing phoenix and all he can do is succumb to it.
He practically purred, "Oh, I think we both know that's not true, sweetheart." Castiel knew it was wrong but this was a little arousing. Dean was being very dominant and it was- No. He was not going to submit to him again. Apparently, that had been a mistake. "Dean, get off me." His voice was gruffer than usual and he hoped Dean wouldn't notice, but of course, he did. He raised his eyebrows and chuckled lightly. "Why?"
He shouldn't be this delighted that Dean replied to his letter, but he is. He doesn't care. This has been the most excitement he's gotten in ages. He unfolds the paper with a childlike glee and reads quickly.
"Focus, Dean. My other question?" Dean rakes his brain, trying to remember what the hell Cas asked. Oh, yeah.
"Holy shit, Sir." Dean mumbles, opening his eyes further to look up at Castiel. He has a wicked idea, and he made Dean cum on his stomach for a reason.
Castiel puts his phone down immediately and pulls Dean off of him, slipping his cock from his mouth.
"This just doesn't feel real, you know? I mean, we met a few days ago, and now we're... boyfriends and... you know. It's just... Good things don't really happen to me, you know? And you're perfect. This whole situation is just so... Hollywood. It's not real. I don't know. I'm kinda expecting the other shoe to drop and for me to wake up alone and-" Castiel shushes him.
They were lying on the bed and Cas was resting his head on Dean's chest while they watched a crappy movie on the tv. Neither of them was really paying attention to it so it was mostly background noise as they talked. Well, Dean talked, Cas texted.
"Hell yeah, I am. I get to dismantle a legend and build it back to its glory with my hands. I can make it shine again and purr like a kitten. I'm frikken... what's the word? I'm..." Dean considers, searching his archives for it. "Buoyant, Cas. I'm buoyant. God, this is going to be so good for us. I can't believe I get to rebuild a ZL - 1. It's a literal dream. You should see her, man."
“Oh, God, Cas. You feel so good around me. I can’t wait to be inside you. Can you… How do I- Just tell me what you want me to.”
Gadreel looks down at his watch, which Castiel notices has a broken face. "About thirty minutes ago, sir. He's very vicious. We didn't know he is such an experienced fighter."
His blood begins to boil and his vision tinges red at the insinuation. Dean emerges from under the car on a rollerboard just as Castiel reaches the woman's side.
So I stuck Crowley in here because why not? Should I write more Crowley? I'm trying to decide whether or not I should stick him in here. I'm leaning more towards a 'yes' but if you guys don't want him, I won't. I can make this Destiel centric. I'm super sorry if Crowley's a little OOC(Or a lot). I've never written Crowley before so I probably failed. Just a little fluff and issues like normal. Next chapter up soon, this is more just a filler, I guess. Not that I'm gypping you guys or anything.  ;)  Don't hate me. Probably post tomorrow if my muses cooperate with my wishes.
Laying there in each other’s arms afterward, spent, is as much a reward as the actual sex was. The AC works overtime to cool them off and it’s not long before goosebumps are pimpling Castiel’s skin.
He hates the feeling, but he loves having Cas's cock inside him, so it kinda makes up for it. Dean wants to be clean and confident. Once he's done and he's all scrubbed and shiny and smelling enticing, he hopes, he sneaks back towards the bed. Dean carefully eases out of his pants and tears his t-shirt off. He squats down and starts digging through his duffel bag as quietly as he can. What Dean wants is at the bottom. He finds them and almost lets out an excited whoop before he remembers he's supposed to be being quiet. He slides on the ruffled, bright blue boy shorts, enjoying the way the lace feels against his skin. God, these always make him feel so sexy. The best thing about these is that they're assless. They leave part of his cheeks and his hole exposed, which means he can wear them while Cas fucks him. He kinda has a thing for the cute little bow sitting on the front of the waistband.
"That we were each other's weaknesses. Achilles heel and all that. You don't fuck with family, and he was telling us we were wrong for that. Then there was Michael, obviously... bastard. There was this thing with our step-brother Adam, and he's trapped in the cage with Lucifer. And Lucifer himself, you know, not good news. There was this bitch... her name was Naomi, ironically. She was one piece of work, I'll tell you that. Then Metatron. That guy was all kinds of whacked. I really can't explain it, there's just so much."
He hears the phone connect, and a weary breath fills the relative silence of his car from his phone's speakers.
Cas opens the door and steps inside and flips on the lights before beckoning Dean to follow. He goes in, not sure what to expect. He's stunned by the coziness of it. Whatever he was expecting, this isn't it. It doesn't look like a sex dungeon, which was kinda what he was picturing. The walls are warm wood panels, cherry? Maybe not. They're a golden brown, like a good whiskey. The carpet is plush and thick, a muted red color that makes Dean think of expensive wine. The lighting is low but plenty bright enough to chase away shadows.
Dean makes a soft sound in the back of his throat as a sign of acknowledgment. Cas seems to take that as an acceptable answer, thank God. If Dean had to speak words right now, he might very well keel over. He's exhausted, and his brain is a bugged-out black mess of only partially recognizable images and sounds.
Cas reaches for something on the shelf, and Dean lets his head loll against him. Cas comes back with a washcloth that he wets and covers in some sort of spicy-smelling soap, then he starts washing Dean. He rubs the soapy cloth over his neck and down the valleys of his chest. Then over his arms and even his hands. Cas is being so patient and gentle, and it's lulling Dean to sleep. This man is too sweet. Dean bites his lip when Cas starts rubbing the cloth over his inner thighs. Cas chuckles in his ear.
"Cas?" He calls in a loud voice and locates his toothpaste with blind hands, not paying a bit of attention as he shoves it in his bag, still staring at the pacifier in his hand. Isn't it a little big for a baby? Dean can't be sure. He barely remembers Sam using a pacifier. As a kid, Sam had always had his thumb in his mouth.
"Hell yes, Sir. Fuck me. Fuck me hard and quick and dirty and mmph!" Dean glares up at Cas because he covered his mouth with his hand. Cas
Cas mumbled something unintelligible and burrowed further into his pillow. Dean chuckled. He shuffled closer to Cas and leaned over his head to whisper in his ear.
"Y-yes. Yes, that's what I want, Sir. I need your cock filling me up. Pounding my ass. I need you, Cas-Sir! Fuck," Dean braces himself for a reprimand but instead gets a sweet kiss.
“Hi,” Dean whispers, and Castiel smiles. He's so cute. Castiel wraps his hands around Dean’s where they’re cupped around his middle and just holds them there, enjoying the solid line of heat at his back. He likes this kind of embrace, it’s not often that he’s had it. Perhaps there’s more to dating than he originally thought. He didn’t realize just how fond of physical contact he is until recently. He loves having Dean touch him. The situation and circumstances don't matter. Castiel hopes that going to a public place together might cement the feeling that they're real. They're real, and together, and it's concrete. He’s not sure of course, but so far, they’ve only been together at the coffee shop where they first met, and their houses, so he imagines that for Dean it feels like that’s the only place they exist. He remembers how scared Dean was that they weren’t real before he dropped the first time and Castiel feels he has done little to alleviate that. He’s hoping the outing today might help.
He was already exhausted and angry, and really the situation could only improve from there, basically. And here is this beautiful man, Adonis, or maybe a Greek god, offering him a way out. Deliverance, almost. He's always been the good little sheep by outward appearances, living under his family's incessant rule, and inside he's dying, suffocating under the church's thumb. He wants to say yes. He's going to be brave and say yes. Instead, what comes out is his deepest desire, one he hadn't intended on voicing.
What he should say is something dirty. Something like how he wants Cas's cock filling him up and fucking him raw, but he doesn't really want that right now. The words get stalled on his tongue. No. He can do this. He can ask Cas for this. He can trust him. He wants something soft and slow and sweet. He wants... "I want you to make love to me."
"Yes," Castiel opens his eyes but doesn't make any other movement. He's waiting to see where this is going.
"Is my beautiful boy begging for my touch already? Would you like me to touch you?" Cas trails his fingertips up over Dean's left shoulder so softly that he can barely feel it, and Dean bites his lip. He wants those beautiful hands on him.
Dean nods, but he doesn't know what to say. She did seem kind, but that doesn't make him feel any better. He used to be better at things like this. It would've been better if he'd had time to mentally prepare, but with everything that had happened last night, they'd been rushing to get out the door this morning.
Perhaps that should be worrying to him. Maybe this all should be. Who's he to say? He doesn't exactly have a lot of experience in any of this. Relationships aren't exactly his forte, and he's never had a partner like Cas. His kinky Dom boyfriend is a huge first for Dean, and actually, he needs to research that. Almost everything he knows about BDSM he knows from Cas. It'd be cool to get his own view on it, find some information, and hell, maybe surprise Cas. The idea makes him feel warm.
"You're not going to piss me off by looking at me. I'm not very easily angered, Dean. Just look up here a minute. I need to see you."
Dean's hand comes up in the space between them, trembling slightly, and he reaches out until his palm is hovering by Cas's face. He implores the man to understand with his eyes, scared that his voice will ruin the tenuous grasp on
"No offense to you, Dr. Bradbury, but Dean, if there's something you don't want to do, you don't have to," Cas says softly. Dean knows he's trying to reassure him, but he also knows it's stupid to come to a doctor and then not let said doctor do their job.
For one instance, Castiel almost corrects him on the title, and it's not 'Sir' that he was going to say. Fuck. Castiel rids himself of the thought immediately and as surely as he can. He and Dean have not spoken about age-play as of yet. It would not be right to ask Dean to call him anything beyond what they've already agreed upon.
God, their scene was so amazing. Dean's never felt that high. It was just like flying, except not mind-numbingly terrifying. He'd do it again in a heartbeat. He hopes they can plan another scene to do soon. He has a feeling he has a new addiction coming on. Sex with Cas is like the best thing ever. But now, as he's laying here thinking about it, there's something else he wants to do too. He'd love to go out on a date with Cas. Like, a real date. With dinner. And drinks. You know... date-stuff. If he runs into any of his friends, he'll just tell them. He's not gonna hide Cas from his family. He wants to show him off. Though he doesn't know what everyone might think of him being 12 years older than Dean. But it doesn't matter. Cas's age isn't an issue, and if any of his friends judge them for that, then Dean doesn't know them like he thinks he does.
He slips the tip of his thumb into his mouth, pressing the textured pad of it against his front teeth and closing his lips around it - not even thinking about it.
"Thank you for telling me. Thank you for being honest. I won't be disappointed if this doesn't end as perfectly as you envision it. I don't expect perfection from you, Dean, or even greatness. I just want honesty, passion, and innocence. I know you will give me those things. Give me that, and it will be great. It will be perfect. And as far as it goes..." Cas's lips give him little butterfly kisses along the nape of his neck, and it has Dean leaning his head back, arching his neck, and baring his throat. "I think you will be fantastic. Do you remember last time?"
Dean shuts the front door behind him and takes a deep breath. It’s meant to calm him, but it just saps the energy out of him. He needs to shower, though, unfortunately. And clothes. Those are important. Actually, no. Dean’s at home, alone, and he doesn’t have to wear clothes if he doesn’t want to.
Dean belts out the lyrics to an Uncle Lucius song and Cas listens contentedly. It's been a really good day overall. He'd like a thousand more of them.
It's a shorty, but I did bang it out in like a little over an hour. And considering how annoying my lil sister is, that's saying a lot, lol. She's like a puppy. I hope you guys enjoyed this chapter! TELL ME!!! Click that comment button and tell me! <3
"Yeah, come on. It was my bedroom, by the way, if you're comfortable with that." Cas nodded slightly as he followed Dean into his bedroom.
"I don't hold much for daytime television. I have heard of it, and now I understand, but no, I've never watched it."
"Sure, why not? Good a chance as any other place right?" Cas seems to accept this and they get out of the car. The little shop is kind of run down, but it's nice enough. There are flowers and rocking chairs in the windows, and it even has a little porch on it that's painted robin egg blue. It looks clean and well kept, if a bit old. Maybe they'll get lucky and they can find Cas a frikken coat so Dean doesn't have to deal with those sad blue eyes. "Well come on, Constantine. No time like the present." Cas nods and follows Dean up the steps and through the door. A bell hanging above it makes a tinkling sound when they walk in.
"Why don't you take it off me, baby boy?" Cas quips back, and Dean has zero hesitation. Dean leans forward, pulling off Cas's cock to do so, and drags the hem of Cas's shirt up over his chest and around his head, and finally throws it onto the floor. All of a sudden, Cas chuckles, and then he's pitched forward when he grabs Dean's hips and slams inside of him, pounding Dean with his length. Dean moans and has to catch himself on the bed so that he doesn't fall onto Cas as he starts to pound into Dean.
It was hot outside and the mall was packed full of people and Dean could sympathize with sardines that got packed into cans. He was feeling like a sardine. A hot, sweaty, irritated sardine.
All of a sudden, Dean is moving. His eyes fly open and he sees Cas’s bright blue eyes looking down at him, his pupils blown and lust evident in his piercing gaze. Cas groans unabashedly and his hand grapples down over Dean’s ass, gripping one of the cheeks and squeezing hard.
There are several moments of silence. Then, "Thanks. I'm not going anywhere either. Just so you know."
P.S. Multiple male orgasms are possible, however, I am a V-owner. Google can only get me so far. Forgive me for any inaccuracies I've displayed here or display in the future.
"I don't know what I did wrong. I guess Dad was just mad. But he had his belt off, and he went to hit me with it. I-I didn't even know Sam had-had followed me. I didn't hear him. He jumped in front of me, and the first hit landed on him. I screamed at Dad to stop. I pushed Sam out of the way and yelled at him to go to his room. Little brat didn't listen, as usual. But then Dad was hitting me, so it didn't matter. I don't know how long it lasted... It felt like forever. I kept asking him to stop, begging, but he didn't listen. My arms were... there was blood... But anyway, when it finally stopped, he just passed out on the couch, and I was crying. I remember that. I was trying not to 'cause Sammy was there, but I couldn't help it. It hurt bad.
A tear leaks from his right eye as Castiel sits in his front seat, and he just lets it fall on his steering wheel. Dean’s home. The Impala is sitting pristine in Dean’s driveway. There’s a single light on in the house, probably the kitchen, but it’s dark on the street, so he doesn’t worry about getting spotted. It's so early in the morning, he's surprised Dean's even up. Castiel just wants to drop this off without having to talk to him. It’s been a week and there hasn’t been so much as a single message or call between them, so he thinks that’s a pretty clear sign that Dean wants to be left alone. So Castiel’s going to do that. But he’s not going to do it with Dean’s things in his house.
"Fuck! Please, sir! Please! Cas, I need your cock. I need you in me! I need you fucking me so hard I won't walk straight tomorrow, or hell, a week from now! Please, Ca-Sir! Please! Please fuck me! I'll be so good, I promise! I promise! Please!" He's babbling incoherently at this point but apparently, it's what Cas wants to hear. Dean's been worked up forever now and he's so close to the edge already. Fuck, fuck,
That had been freaking fantastic, and that was an understatement. Dean hadn't come that hard in like forever. He laid his forehead against Cas's, sharing breath until he had his breathing under control. "Cas. That was fucking awesome. Mmm." He hummed a light note as Cas tucked him back into his pants and pulled the zipper back up. "I had a similar comment." Cas's dry tone surprised a laugh out of Dean. Well alright then. As his brain fully came back online he realized what he had done. "Uh, Cas. You're covered in cum aren't you?" Cas looked down like it was the most surprising thing he'd ever heard. "Oh. It appears I am."
"How often have you been bothered by feeling bad about yourself – or feeling that you are a failure, or that you have let yourself or your family down?"
"Do not call my Father's name while you think about the pleasure that your fantasies of me give you. Do you understand?"
Dean just couldn't seem to control his laugh, and he kept chuckling as Cas gave him a confused look. It was actually really cute. "Alright. Let's go get you some clothes. I'm sure you're not too comfortable in your pants, huh?" Cas wrinkled his nose. "No. I am not. But I don't... Um... Can't go home like this." He mumbled very quietly, and Dean would've been surprised if another human could've heard it, but with his awesome hearing, Dean didn't have a problem.
They sit in a booth in McDonald's, Dean opposite him, rapidly eating french fries like they're going out of style. Castiel looks at him with bemused eyes as he grabs his burger and starts to dig in wholeheartedly. The first juicy bite of beef, bacon, and melted cheese is
He bends a little at the waist and squints at the fridge, hoping something delicious will magically appear. Sadly, the food fairy doesn't do him any favors and nothing appears.
you get out, I'll be waiting. If you even think about coming near Sam or Dean again, I'll see to it that you don't make it to the next morning, understood?"
"Well, flapjacks and sausage work for me. I'm hungry too, Sir." Shit. Castiel suppresses a shiver and shoots Dean a glare, which makes him chuckle.
how uncomfortable to drive in. He’s pretty sure he’s got denim burn on his asscheeks (because no, he’s not going to wear a dead man’s underwear. That’s just weird).
"I know that's how it's done. It's just- I don't know. You're in control, Sir, and I trust you. I know you won't do anything I don't want. Being constantly asked about it would just kinda pull me out and make me nervous, I think."
The man's eyebrows raise in surprise, and he smirks as he lets go of Dean's hand. "Do you always slur all your words together, or are you intoxicated?"
Castiel turns the water off in the tub and moves his right hand to support Dean. His left travels down the length of his back following the natural curvature, slowly tracing over the slight ridges of Dean's spine.
He slides his erection past Dean's pouty lips, and it's heaven. A hot, slick tongue starts twining its way around his cock, and Castiel puts a hand to the wall behind Dean and the other in his hair, tugging slightly, encouraging.
"They are sensitive. Fantastic. Alright, hands crossed behind your back, baby boy. Like this." He demonstrates with his own hands, and Dean copies the movement behind his back. Cas makes quick work of the knots with his tie, and after only a few moments, Dean's wrists are trapped behind his back.
Cas surges forward and Dean grabs his hair as their mouths mesh, Cas forcing his tongue inside and plundering his mouth, making Dean shiver all over. He whimpers and tugs on Cas's hair with his fingers, while the other hand scrambles around to grab Cas's T-shirt, pulling him in closer, unconsciously undulating his hips. God, he wishes he could get closer to Cas, his body is thrumming with excitement and anticipation. He doesn't think Cas would fuck him in the car, at least not here where there's-
"I wouldn't say it's in the way. Things happen and we deal with them. This is real life too, you know?"
'Amazing' is the word he wants to say, but he can't picture himself doing that. He couldn't dominate Cas, he doesn't think. When Dean first met him. he thought he could, but now? Hell no. It'd just feel weird.
The happiness leaks out of him like a sagging balloon slowly deflating and the reality of the situation hits him again in a rush.
This is going to feel so good. He's still loose from his shower so he goes ahead and slides his finger in, going right for the gold.
They'd have to find a new place before winter though, Dean didn't have a way to heat this place, not without risking killing them both in a fire. There'd been a few musty blankets in a closet that Dean had found. They smelled like smoke but they were in mostly good condition, and not too thin. Their bed consisted mostly of just old flour sacks stuffed with grass but Dean thought it had been pretty good thinking on his part. He used a couple of the blanket to cover the rough texture of the bags, and he and Sammy covered up with the rest. It suited them just fine he guessed. He could only be thankful that Sammy had grown up in it so he didn't know it wasn't right that they lived like this. In a couple more years, maybe just one more, Sam would start asking questions. Questions Dean didn't want to answer, ones he wanted to avoid at all costs. Questions that would make Dean feel guilty. He was doing the best he could, but he knew it wasn't enough. He just knew it. Sam's hollow eyes and visible ribs told him that.
“So good.” Dean moans and rocks his hips faster, matching Castiel’s punishing rhythm, Castiel pants above him, trying and failing, to catch his breath. Dean’s face is flushing from the exertion and his eyes are glassy with pleasure.
"If I ever see you again, I'll kill you. Don't come near me, or Sam, anymore. You're the worst fucking person I've ever met, and you're nothing more than a sperm donor. You've never been a father." Dean rises and turns, walking away quickly.
Dean chuckles and raises his head, "Come on, Benny, it's not that bad. What about that time when I caught you with Rebecca
"Good. Good boy. Precious Dean. So amazing. Do you think you can drink some water for me, baby boy?"
"ACDC. A man after my own heart. I knew I liked you, Cas." He leaned over and gave him a quick kiss on the cheek, leaving behind a faint blush that Dean was a little in love with. It was nice to see the little angel all flustered and out of his element. He slid the cassette tape into the player and the heavy guitar sounds and familiar drum beats of Back in Black began to play. God, it was going to be a good day. He eased down on the gas gently and pulled her out of the alleyway carefully, loving how smoothly Baby handled. They pulled out onto the road and were soon tooling along at a steady clip when Cas gasped beside him and Dean caught the barest scent of fear.
Teeth grazed his shoulder then they latched in a rough bite that had Castiel gasping, then Dean soothed it with his tongue, licking languorously at it. Castiel picked up the pace, rubbing his length against Dean greedily, aching for more. Dean huffed a soft laugh before nipping at Castiel's skin in a path up the side of his neck. Hungry hands are running all over his chest, then down to his thighs, fingers digging into the large muscles.
Castiel gets a dishrag to the face for his effort, and it makes him bust out in laughter at seeing Dean's red face. He's flushed from the lip of his t-shirt to his ears, and frankly, it's adorable. Castiel's still laughing when he puts the dishrag on the counter and turns of his sauce, moving it onto the back burner. He walks around the bar and spins Dean's stool to where he's facing him and grabs his face in between his hands, and kisses him soundly. When he pulls away, Dean looks up at him through light lashes and says, "You're an ass."
Castiel swallows, "I actually do like the taste, you know. I love fried food, and burgers, and pie. I'm just a lot older than you, though. This burger is going to take at least a week of jogging to burn off. It's so worth it though." He grins and digs back in. Dean smirks and they both continue to munch until their food is mostly gone. Castiel grabs a few greasy fries and chews them thoughtfully. As if on cue, Dean grabs a napkin, wipes his face, and sighs.
The words send tingles of trepidation and excitement through him. What's Cas gonna do? From some inner pocket of his trench coat that he's still freaking wearing Cas produces a bottle of lube. Oh, fuck yes, finally. Cas maneuvers off Dean's legs and in between them, pushing at the backs of Dean's sweaty knees to get them to spread further. It's a little hot in the room and he's all worked up now. He doesn't remember it being hot a few minutes ago. But then again, he didn't have an angel fondling his balls either, so... Cas frowns and raises his hand in a weird waving gesture off to the side of the bed and Dean feels cool air skate over his overheated skin. He mojoed the thermostat. Awesome. Dean realizes that he feels really exposed like this with a fully clothed Cas kneeling between his spread legs and staring down at his junk like it's the Holy Grail or something.
He's just settling in for the night when his phone goes off. He considers ignoring it, but a nagging thought at the back of his mind makes him roll over and grab it. Maybe it's C. He didn't have a letter on his door earlier which kind of worried him. Maybe he pushed too far by telling the dude to text him. Luckily, he's wrong. The text is from C. He inputs the contact information then texts him back.
He didn't think he could deal with his mother right now on top of everything else. He was tired and hungry, and he had a large headache buzzing behind his temples like an angry swarm of bees. He closed the grey door quietly without so much as a whisper of sound and walked across his small, grey, utilitarian bedroom. Almost everything in it was grey, and he had very few personal items. He was not allowed anything frivolous or exciting, his parents thought it would distract his mind from the mission of fulfilling God's plan. He didn't even bother pulling the thin blanket down, he just laid down on his hard mattress, shoes, and clothes still on. His feet were aching, and his head was pulsing in time with his heartbeat.
"I'll explain it later. I promise." Sam steps out first, but neither of them notices when he stops dead in his tracks. Dean plows right into him. "What the hell-"
"Thanks, stranger." He mumbles. Then an idea strikes him. He can tell the stranger thank you. The post office should be able to give it to whoever sent it. So he sits down and writes the note and decides to walk to the post office tonight just to get it over with. He can't wait to call Sammy and tell him about the new clothes he has.
"Of course." Dr. Bradbury says, and Dean wonders if what she's really thinking. She's young for a doctor, he thinks.
His butt is numb, and his feet are tingling, but it's beyond him to care at the moment. His mind is wrapped around what happened earlier. Everything that happened at the club and all the events afterward are a blur of motion and noise in his mind. Like a liquid-time-warp was poured into his memories. Something happened after everything with Dad, but he can't for the life of him think of what it might have been. He doesn't remember anything besides warmth. That's not a terrible memory, he supposes. It's better than the police and the paramedics swarming through his thoughts. God, what he wouldn't give to forget everything that happened.
He's heard of Seraphim Street, and he thinks he knows where it is. About twenty minutes later, he finds out he's right. It's a pretty lane surrounded by tall oaks and aspens, and there's only one house at the end of the lane. Dean pulls into the driveway with more than a little nervousness. He tightens his hands on the steering wheel and rests his head against it for a moment, closing his eyes and gathering his thoughts. He takes a deep breath and climbs out of the car, observing the house.
Dr. Bradbury gives him a kind smile, "I understand it might be a bit uncomfortable. The reason I'm requesting that we do further testing is to make sure you get the proper medication that will fit your needs the best. Every person is different, and everyone reacts to medication differently. Some people can spend years trying to find the right medication. I'd like to find out a bit more about you and see if we can't get you a medication that will work right the first time. You also haven't had a physical in..." She glances at her tablet and scrolls a little, "Eight years. So, I don't think it's a bad idea to get you checked out fully and make sure we have the full picture."
Their breath intermingles and Dean wonders how he lived without him so long. "I'm... I'm really glad we're okay."
Nothing seems to want to go right today. He's just been irritated and less than patient since he awoke. He wonders if he had a nightmare that he doesn't remember or some such thing. That would usually put him in a mood like this, but it truly doesn't feel like that. Something just feels wrong. He doesn't know what. He's checked on his surrounding friends and Dean. He even called Balthazar just to make sure. But something isn't right and he can't put his finger on it. It's like a gnat by his ear, or something tingling along the back of his neck. Like something's coming.
