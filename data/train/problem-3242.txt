Sam frowned. He reached out to him but stopped short a few centimeters away from his jacket. "Dean is Sam. Your little brother. What the hell did they do to you?" His voice raised in volume for every word he said. Sam glanced over at Castiel in wonder. Dean was beginning to get very done with their attitude.
Sam thought.
Castiel's eyes narrowed. "How are you?" He managed to ask. Another awkward silence was the last thing he needed.
Dean closed his eyes and said his anterior prayer. "God, save me because I have sinned. I couldn't protect my brother from the devil. If you exist, you better get your lazy ass done here. I swear I am going to kill the son of a bitch that did this, you hear me?. It's all I ask," Dean said, his finger did the final push, the pang screamed loud and clear to the empty highway around.
Bobby let go of his gun, he grabbed hold of Dean before giving him a tight hug. Castiel decided to clear his throat. Dean spun around with his hand outstretched although, Bobby pushed Dean behind him. Well, that was a surprise.
Dean thought to himself while he took a big bite of the sandwich.
Dean snapped inside himself. He zapped away to a green field. He could feel emotions battling inside of him. Tears streamed down his face, Dean wiped them away with shivering fingers. His heart was like it broke into pieces. Dean wanted to scream out the pain. Dean bit his underlip until it drew blood.
The woman sat beside the person he knew was named Castiel. Dean studied her for a short moment. Her red straight hair caught his attention first then her grey-blue eyes. "Who are you?" She asked him.
Dean went out of the car and sat back in the front seat. Cas followed his example and was on Sam's shotgun seat. Before Cas managed to open his mouth, his clear blue eyes giving him a questioning and confused glance Dean put on
"I am trying," his handheld tight around the bench. Castiel saw hurt pass between them. The dim light from the colored windows in rainbows on the floor made Anna look as if she had a halo around her head. Castiel blinked. It disappeared.
Cas circled Chuck, wielded his own angel blade.
"I am fine," he said clip. The knight demon or whatever pushed his backward a few steps. Dean could with some difficulty kill it but an ache blossomed in his chest by the thought of it. He perplexed stopped up. "Sam Winchester," he said.
"Do you really believe is him? You said yourself that he was the dead body in the impala," Anna argued back.
"Fine," Sam said. His eyes changed to pitch black for a moment as he turned away from him. "They will try to manipulate him into someone he isn't. There is one thing they can never take away from him," Sam said. That caught Castiel's interest with a thrill.
He heard things being moved on Bobby's end of the phone. Sam noticed quickly Bobby was out of breath before he started talking."
Sam's eyes narrowed at that but he decided not to look further into it, his brother would tell him one way or another. He closed the door silently. Sam sat back in the living room. Dean would never know before it was too late to do anything. Sam had to make sure of that, it was for the best. His thoughts wandered back to Dean's reaction when meeting Castiel. Sam knew something was changing for his brother, for the better. Dean's happiness had to last in any form it could exist on.
Later he called the police and of course, the press arrived as well. It left a bitter taste in his mouth, one of the paramedics gave him a white thick soft blanket to take around his shoulder. He sat in an ambulance, red, blue, and white lights reflected themselves in the parking lot. A police officer tried to make him talk about the event that had happened. But Dean's head repeated every failure he did before his brother died and wasn't capable of comprehending what he said.
He went into the shower and changed into more comfortable clothes. Castiel threw himself on the bed, it's softness welcoming from his sore legs. At some point, he had fallen asleep since when he woke up the lamps were on and the windows outside showed the faint lights of the city. He jolted up when he heard footsteps.
"Give the word, and they are dead," Castiel said. Before Sam opened his mouth, he waved his hand and made Sam get back to hell in that instant. In his place, he summoned Anna and Haziel.
He stared confused at her. "I beg you pardon?"
"No," Dean acted quickly, his hands took hold of Raphael's black suit with his fists clenched until they turned white. With a slight movement that ended in Dean throwing Raphael before appearing to him again. He slammed Raphael to the wall. Raphael obviously gave no shits about it. "So, we can either do this the easy way or the hard."
"I mean it," Sam cut him off. He laughed short humorlessly. "You fear me because I got more power than you can ever wish to gain and I am not having in my faith in any of you." Sam continued. He smiled dangerously now, he could feel the waves of fear coming from the king of hell. "I won't play by your rules. I will follow my own. You can go and screw yourself for all I care."
When Dean stood up again, his green eyes glanced around the big space around him. Hundreds of replica's laid scattered on the floor. He heard the familiar sound of wings that shattered the space. Instead of Raphael that Dean expected, he noticed it was another angel. Another as Raphael.
. Gone. Gone. New changes began to break Dean apart, the growth of something huge on his back.
, modern artists I think we got," Dean lifted his thumbs as he continued to count the artists. "
. The urge and curiosity finally won the best of him.
Winchester."
"See you soon, Baby," Dean said to Baby before he turned his back to walk towards the house. He had already told his producer that he would need a few months to write a new album. It would give him enough time to figure out his songs. He knocked on the door waiting for Bobby to open.
Blood rushed in his ears. Dean imagined pulling off the trigger, thereafter, how the tissue of his brain matter would hit the seat behind him. The blood would sink into the car and stick like glue. How some random stranger would find his decaying body. Still, that choice was more appealing than the latter.
"Thank you," Cas said.
"No! I mean yes, I have done intercourse," Castiel's face turned red as a tomato while he avoided staring directly at anywhere near Dean's private parts. "This is inappropriate," Castiel managed to shift the topic. Dean rolled his eyes before he leaned forward on his knees making him on Castiel's eye level.
He expected Crowley's blow with the angel blade he hid in his suit. Sam dodged it in one smooth movement, grabbed hold of Crowley's arm, and put pressure into it. He saw when Crowley used his demonic powers to his chest. One second he stood behind Crowley and the next his back hit the wall.
"Yes," Anna smiled. The heavy footsteps of Dean's boots hit the floor made Castiel nervous.
The black and white mingled together around him, Dean turned his head to check one last time as he drove to
"No, contact me when you see him. The last time I saw him, he appeared at his own funeral. No sign of him," Castiel said.
He should have known better than to agree with Dean.
"Fine, I will give you my last slice of pancake," Dean pushed his plate over to him, he took it excited. He knew exactly what to do to make his big brother do as he wished. The advantage of being the little brother. He ate up the rest of the plate in a more civilized manner than his brother.
on me, Sammy. I am not going to talk about it," Dean considered what had happened lately. Firstly, Bobby's and Sam's attitudes made no sense whatsoever in Dean's book and the research his brother did. Second, the weather was being stronger than usual for the time of the year. It didn't make sense and he held no detective expert card just a bunch of awesome references.
"How about...no," Lucifer slammed his head against the surface. He saw rainbow-colored stars behind his eyelids. The pain jogged to his skull. Sam squinted. He dealt with a dangerous fallen angel. To reason with him would a challenge itself.
Sam stared for a few moments before the joke hit him. Power surged in his bones. "I can't wait to start some murders up there," Sam said.
Castiel smiled politely to Anna, his hand moved unconsciously to his pocket.
Dean tapped his feet to the drummer's beat. For a short moment, he clapped his palm with the microphone the crowd quickly mimicking him. "Don't hold anything for granted, then the worshipping underneath your toes. Oh, man. How they touched me. Expecting a scream. Oh, man"
. He frowned for a second, waiting for Balthazar to continue. "I am never, ever going to give up my brother. How did you know?" He talked the words quickly through his mouth.
"I didn't know music was from the heart," Cas started, he looked down where Dean touched the strings. He faced Dean. "You are right, it hurt to play on a guitar." Cas's eyes stared at his palm.
"You were just waiting to say that, didn't you?" Sam put on the timer on his clock. A flash of memory hit him, unconsciously he stepped a footstep back. His eyes become distant.
"Excuse me?" The priest said his features in shock. A few heads turned towards him.
"Have faith," Anna answered. She thanked Bobby before he gave him the glass of alcohol. "God gives the heaviest burdens to the ones that can bear it," she continued.
"Boring? Who was the one that made you laugh? That's me."
Sam's jaw clenched. He sighed and held tighter to the wheel. At some point he was far outside of California, he checked his bag that he had everything with him. Bobby tried to call multiple times but he didn't answer. Sam parked the 1967 Chevrolet Impala outside a farmer's house he before hand-checked nobody used anymore.
Lucifer took his arms behind his head. "In time, you have gotten better at dragging out the pain. Up there?" Lucifer pointed at the ceiling. "More primitive torture methods but I am sure you will find something fun to use, right?" They arrived ten minutes later into the throne room where Crowley sat snapping at demons that avoided looking into his eyes.
"No, nothing. I have been thinking when Cas feels alright with it. We should go camping. It will help," Dean whipped together the eggs and everything else for a few minutes. Sam nodded slowly.
Raphael retreated a few steps backward. Sam laughed coldly. If only this idiot knew what he was doing. Sam moved with calculated steps until he stood inches from Raphael. Raphael's blade suddenly in his hand. Sam's eyes narrowed.
. Balthazar asked for beers before they sat down.
From their facial expressions, Dean caught on worry.
The song made him get a lump in his throat. Castiel recalled how open Dean had been when he introduced him to the world of music. The way his eyes twinkled in the lights above their heads. His rough fingertips against his soft ones. Then Castiel finally let his voice loose.
"Thank you, Dean," a sad smile appeared on her face. She wiped away the tears from her cheeks and made a determined look pass her features. "I won't disappoint."
if you don't mind?" Castiel asked politely.
Dean flipped his blade in the air and gripped hold of it at the end. The point straight at Castiel's chest, however, Castiel was not able to see him. The blue in Castiel's eyes made him debut what he should do. His nature told him to follow orders. Carry them out, and don't think. Then why was it so difficult?
Haziel gave him an I-am-so-done-with-you-face, Sam laughed. "Yes, the parallels are similar to our situation but I got pressing matters on my hands." Before Sam managed to pick together a response he flew away.
To wake up with a headache was definitely not Dean's agenda of a good start to the day. He groaned loudly and rubbed his eyes with his hands. When he had planned to ask Cas for guitar lessons he had chickened out in the last second and he hated himself for it. When Dean turned his head and saw a glass of water with pills on the side he grabbed it. In one gulp he took the pills with the glass of water. Still, his head hurt like hell and he ran into the bathroom to throw up. Maybe he had drunk too much beer.
He looked around. The neon light lit up the name for the place however, he knew better than to say it. Instead, he lifted his gaze to the road he came from. Quickly Sam calculated what he should say next without raising suspicion. He went back to the car and took out the bag Sam needed. It's pain burned through his shoulder. Sam began the short stride to the Motel entrance. "Seriously? I am not a little kid anymore," Sam said while he opened the door. "Dean, I got to go, talk to you tomorrow." Before Dean could muster an answer he ended the conversation by pressing end.
Dean grit his teeth together. He had no way getting out of it, Cas was speaking the truth after all.
Sam's head snapped up so quickly he almost got whiplash. He took a deep breath.
"I don't know, whatever you want," Lucifer smiled back at him. "I got to fix boring things in hell. When you are done scaring humans report to me, we got a hell to start," Lucifer said and then he disappeared from his spot.
"Yes," Castiel said. He moved to Dean in his own accord as he was into his personal space. Bobby moved unwillingly away from them, his mind probably back into his weapons that wouldn't work against him. "You," Castiel whispered the one word so solely Dean could hear.
He suppressed the urge of pain to slipping through his words. Sam ate more of his salad before he answered. "I have my reasons," Sam pushed the plate away. He had lost his appetite. Once again their gazes locked. The nag in the back of his mind became more insisting.
"No, I am not. There are monsters out there they're going to kill me. And you can't stop it. Hell, I can't run. Hiding is out of the question, they know how to find a soul. I am sorry," Sam let his gaze linger on Dean's face. He read Dean as an open book, it went against all his instincts to every word he said. Dean never believed in the supernatural and now, he was about to get killed for it.
His father had basically told him to take care of his little brother. He failed there as well. Dean sobbed into the silence. Cas attempted calling him again and Dean turned off the phone. His mind wandered to the memories before Sam died. Dean knew the clues yet he was a coward to not face them in time. He did not want to encounter more of it anymore.
Castiel licked his lips. For a long moment he thought, he didn't mind the press insisting to made him answer at a more rapid pace. He knew that the press would twist his words in days, maybe even months after this. "I know and I am willing to take the chances," he answered with confidence, a glint passed his eyes.
"It is bad, did nobody teach you how to act around here?" Castiel gave Dean a questioning glance. Dean shrugged.
Sam really considered shouting the guy up. He spoke nothing but nonsense. He had researched a lot of weird monsters although this, took the cake even for him. "How? Because I got demon blood in me?" He spat in fury.
"Hello," Castiel greeted them.
Castiel wore his usual trench coat, black suit though his hair was ruffled.
Castiel lifted his head and his gaze made him move his feet uncomfortable on his spot. "Dean? Are you alright?" Castiel's voice shook, his eyes that before were a darker shade of blue became lighter. Close to white, Dean's soul could feel the raw power that streamed out. Castiel's hands cupped the side of his cheek.
. Dean turned towards Gabriel. "No, of course not. He stole the toilet paper and thought he was a unicorn. I had to clean up his mess."
Castiel looked confused at Dean, a frown became apparent on his face."No, as far I am aware cats eat rats and not tongues."
Dean bit back a question on his tongue, Raphael had been strict about that. Never to ask questions and only follow orders. He liked to believe he did a great job at that. "Then is not over yet," Dean said instead. He wanted badly to go out and hunt for demons. Those were a disgrace to the human race in his eyes.
. He clenched his teeth together in frustration. A ghost of wind touched his cheeks as the flutter of....was it wings? Before the guy two stood on the other side of his body. "This can't wait, the demons and rogue angels are assembling to their future leader. You know it as well, as I."
He walked round in yet another circle in the panic room, his hand under his cheek. Dean sighed, a hand ruffled through his hair. To be stuck in here was boring. Cas unlocked him after the intercourse some days after what they did...
When Sam finally arrived at their destination, he stood in awe. The whole room was pitch black. On the sides, sigils Sam never studied were on the walls. Chains hang to the ground. Sam stopped and Lucifer bumped into him before Lucifer shoved him into the room. The bad gut feeling made it worse for what Sam believed the fallen archangel had in mind.
"The impala is right here," Sam rolled his eyes and both of them found the car in the parking lot.
A laugh from Sammy when he lost the video game—
Sam frowned. "Like what?" Sam turned his head in Lucifer's direction when he heard the answer from the guy he now had learned to appreciate.
"What you need, is to get laid," Bobby took up a new class and begun the same progress. His facial expression was serious.
"I apologize, I was looking for Dean Winchester and did not expect you Bobby Singer."
Dean's hand clenched around the handgun. Its beauty a grim reminder of what cruelty it was capable of. Who knew the human lives killed by it? Dean stared for a few moments.
Haziel nodded slowly. "Reasonable, can I open the page?" He moved to open his jacket to take it up but Sam grabbed his wrist. They froze in their positions. Sam's gaze radiated anger enough to make the angel withdraw his arm from the jacket. "Not the time," Haziel concluded. No emotions were exposed to his face.
"What kind of name is 'Castiel' anyway?" Dean asked and stared at him. His frown appeared on his delicate features.
"It's not like that," Sam struggled to say, his vision becoming darker. He gripped his brother tighter. "This battle is going to last forever if we don't stop it." Then the power went out of his body. Sam's body went limp. He heard chairs scrape over the wooden floor. Voices that got loud.
"You always say that!"
"As if I care," Dean took off to the kitchen to a few beers. His hand stilled a few centimeters from it. Flashes of memories when Sam taught him how to drink made him stop. On the second attempt, he had the beer empty.
Dean almost stumbled on his feet and then his hand shot out to grip the door handle. His breath stunk of alcohol, his eyes were red and he smiled. "Yeah, whatever," Dean waved it off before he went into the bathroom without offering him a second glance.
His eyes widened in shock. "No, there is no need to consider my sexual desires," Castiel said. He pushed the money back into Dean's hands. "I am good."
"Cas—"
"That's all?" Dean huffed as he turned away. "No, 'I am sorry I fucked you and trapped you in the bed for days'?" Dean continued, amusement laced itself into his tone. Dean shrugged. "That's okay for me, I am just a weapon anyway." Dean's breath got caught in his throat when Cas invaded his personal space. His skin started to prickle, his heart speed up and he became very aware of how close Cas stood.
Stillness. Sam felt something nagging him under his skin but he couldn't place the feeling. Dean's voice snapped his thoughts back to reality. "
Winds blew stronger outside and the doors slammed to the chains. Thunderstruck everywhere, for once Dean was grateful for all those hard lessons in Michael's care. Castiel tilted his head to the side. By a snap of his fingers, the powers from his end stopped working. Damn it. How was he supposed to kill the guy? Maybe that was what Father meant by waiting.
"Oh, right!" Dean took up his mobile from his leather jacket.
on it. He frowned and opened the book.
"I like it, a good first choice. Like last time, I will demonstrate which pressure and strings you use with your fingers. When I see you do a wrong thing, I will help out, okay?" Dean's voice soft sounded in the progress of his words. After Dean showed some examples for the beginning of the song.
Mary's words to him at night, "angels are watching over you,"
"Yep, that's great," Father patted his shoulder. Something that confused him even more. "Did you do what Raphael commanded you to?"
"Seriously? I came all the way here to just heal your cancer?" She counter-augmented.
Sam raised his eyebrow. "I don't get it, why all the work for a Knight title?" He baited Lucifer. His hazel eyes narrowed. Lucifer shrugged his question off. Sam fought against the ropes and chains again. It dug into his flesh as lion claws, Sam bit his underlip in frustration and laid his head on the cold surface.
"Me too." Dean flashed a smile again.
He bit his underlip and looked away. "A personal story, about pain, losing everything you cared for. And the fire?" Dean held his breath for a second before he continued. "It was a fire...both of my parents," he paused.
"Thank you, Bobby," he was already by the fridge before Bobby had finished his sentence. He took out the white plate with cherry pie out on the counter. He licked his lips and mumbled to himself "Love me some pie." He pushed away from the thoughts about mythology, Dean knew such things never had existed and never will.
Castiel took a deep breath before he moved away from him. A second later they appeared inside the church. Dean stood beside a small altar where the archangel angel stood as a small statue. "You are Dean Winchester," Castiel began, his voice thundered. "A well-known rock star on his way up to the legends. He is a role model for people that suffers from problems the president won't take up. Dean is a man of his word," Castiel said.
" Anna sighed. Castiel maneuvered the car flawlessly through a few other ways. Unconsciously he let out a breath. The darkness outside gave him a chilling feeling, the hair on his back raised. Unfortunately, he couldn't stop in the middle of the way to investigate further, no how it appealed to him.
Dean decided to get out of the room, nothing inside this room interested anyway. He took his brown military jacket he had gotten from his father a few years back, his fingers gripped tightly around the edge of the jacket. He opened the door and nodded at one of his guards; "Hey Gabriel," he said.
. Dean rubbed his eyes while he continued. "Yeah, I found books about lore and myths. Not just any kind, monsters that don't exist. Is he going nuts or something? Sammy has never been like this before." He chose not to tell about Bobby.
"Son of a bitch," Dean swore irritated. Sam read his brother as an open book, he was upset about someone, most likely the person he had advised on.
He thought about his music. The music made him happy in ways his being felt at peace. Dean's eyes lit up when an idea crossed his mind, he had seen how interested Cas had looked at his guitar, he could teach him how to play. Dean smiled to himself.
"Who inspired you to write the song? I mean, I know you don't say who it is," Sam typed down on his laptop, the feeling of pressing the keyboard made him relax his shoulders. He turned his head back at Dean again.
Dean flew away as quick he could. What he least expected was to see his ...friend. Sam smiled at him. His Blade bloody from the dead bodies, humans actually. Dean's mouth opened in shock. What the hell was wrong with this guy? "Sam?"
He flipped through the clean white pages, no demon wanted to tell him how to get out of the deal he had made. Sam took his pen and began to scribble down his unsuccessful attempt at calling a demon. He hid the rest of the stuff underneath the floor he had made a few weeks before. He sat down and began the tiresome research.
"No, I share it with my brother. We jam together sometimes, done it since I was a teenager," Dean shrugged. He gestured to Cas to sit down into one of the chairs. He rubbed his neck. "I, uh, teaching someone to play the guitar, you need to eh..." he put his palms together. "Touch one another, but is that alright with you? I will stop when you ask me," Dean finished, he stood still. His green eyes meeting Cas's where they stayed locked for some time.
"It isn't right Cas," Dean said. He poked on the seat he sat on. He was supposed to tell Camilla he experienced in things. Or at least that what he wanted to believe. None of them showed signs of changing their positions. Cas sighed.
Sam frowned yet he understood the change of topic, Dean disliked having too much focus on himself. He thought for a long while before he answered. Abuse what never an easy topic in their household however Sam was a person that wanted to help people even it meant he had to lie to them.
"All alone, in this big world. Made of steel and harsh words. I got no idea, where I am going," Dean began the chorus. He stopped tapping the beat when the pianist grew silent. Slowly, he took the microphone away from his face. He directed it to the crowd, a knowing smile on his face. The audience repeated what he had sung before;
"Yeah? What?" He settled on in the end. Sam's hand twitched for some reason. Okay, better be careful then. This demon was high ranking for a reason. He needed intel. Better safe than sorry.
" Pure shock flashed through Haziel's delicate features. His voice shook in slight panic by his words, his pupils dilated to big plates. Somehow, Haziel could be more human than Anna could ever be. Must be the rank they had differently.
He had looked forward all week to the next lesson with his idol, Dean Winchester. Castiel stepped up the stairs to the entrance of the house. Above his head, the stars blinked down at him while they shone up the way. Before he managed to knock on the door slammed open in his face. Dean's grin lit up his dull at the second their eyes meet. The dull ache in his chest disappeared. "Hello Dean," Castiel said.
Castiel leaned until he was beside his ear, "I love you," he whispered. Dean shivered. Then he bit under his earlobe, Dean twitched. His cock tightened in his jeans. His heart was in his throat. Dean's want reflected themselves in Castiel's eyes. Castiel moved away from his plaid before he began to plant kisses on his neck and abdomen.
Instead, he wrote poems about love, life, bees, and philosophy. His favorite subject when he went to school. Often Dean would suggest a poem and create a song for it. Life was good. He enjoyed every second it lasted.
"Ooh, ooh, and she's buying a stairway to heaven." Dean began to slowly tap the beat with his foot. He seemed completely in his element and he sang as it was his last day on earth.
he thought.
. A man with black hair, Dean recognized quickly was Haziel. An angel there were a few tales about.
"I believe in you," was Cas's words before he told him where the press conference where.
"Dean, we both know that is difficult for you—" Sam started before Dean slammed his fist on the desk. "Woah, calm down." Sam put his hands up signalizing he wasn't up for an argument. The pain distracted his thoughts from the gut feeling he bore in his chest.
Dean sat on a white sofa, he took deep breaths. It had been a long journey to get this far. Dean knew all the songs by memory as always. A loud knock made him jump, on the sofa. The familiar voice of one of the stage guys shattered the silence.
"Yeah, and Dean, you need to talk with her. Alone," Sam said. Dean and Camilla nodded and moved out of the room. Cas walked over to the window, his shoulders slumped. Sam moved to stand beside him. They both stared out of California waking from its sleep. He enjoyed the ray of sunlight that kissed his skin. For soon, that would be a memory.
"Y-yeah, I didn't do anything stupid did I?" Dean began to eat to cover up his slip-up.
"Hey Bobby, I was wondering if your information is the same as I have," he started with. Sam could basically see how the wheels moved in Bobby's head.
"Which song do you want to learn?" Dean tapped his hand to the guitar creating a noise in the room. "We got
"Whatever, he is..." Dean looked away, the pain flared through his heart as a thousand swords launched his body. Dean gulped, tears were on the brink of spilling. Then he realized he had left Cas. Hate hit him hard enough that he stumbled backward until he collided with the wall. "Dead," Dean mumbled. "Damn it," he picked up the phone from his back pocket, once he unlocked it with the code Sam was so proud of it began to playing loudly in the room.
"Y-you are insane!" A woman in a red dress and wrinkles said in horror.
. When Sam shoved him playfully on the shoulder he snapped his gaze back to the game. "You got to be kidding me, my team is losing," Dean groaned in frustration.
He heard Cas open the door, he froze when Dean saw a girl holding a
He heard two knocks on the door before he opened. Camilla's eyes were red from crying, her hands shook while she bit her underlip. A furious gaze met him, Sam moved out of the way so she ended up in the middle of the room. Then the yelling started, Sam gripped hold of Camilla's shoulder.
to someone you have yet to met."
A short pain and disappointment passed Castiel's eyes. "I have been meaning to ask for your number," Castiel said hopefully.
It was, well, hell.
"Thank you I guess," Dean moved to the window, his eyes lost to the void outside that reflected the horror inside of Castiel. They went to bed and pretended it hadn't happened. Most of the time before they reached California a few weeks later, Dean seemed to become used to Castiel's presence. Yet the air was electric with every touch and hidden whisper.
The smash of the laptop getting shut did that he flinched. Sam cleared his throat and turned his hazel eyes towards him. Dean studied him. Sam avoided looking him in the eyes. Instead, his right hand kept tugging on the white paper on his desk. "What? I told you to knock on the door," Sam said.
Castiel tilted his head. A frown shaped itself on his face. He thought for some time before he answered. Castiel sat down on one of the chairs in the room, he studied Dean's face. "I do write poetry and watch bees. My passion lays in...the beauty of words. What singing is for you," Castiel took a deep breath although he collected his thoughts. Dean took forward his guitar he used last time.
"Anyway, is everything fixed? The musicians know what you need?" He fired the questions quickly to Dean to distract him. He knew Dean exploited every chance to talk about his music. He was on the road by the moment his big brother started talking again. He had invited Cas to join them during and after the concert. Sam began to feel suspicious. Dean's girlfriend might take it the wrong way, it could mean disaster for both of them. Maybe even destroy Dean's whole career, he focused on the way once again.
"You got to be kidding me, who says no to get laid?" Dean green eyes stared into him a little too long for his own comfort.
The man, Castiel looked up. Surprise wrote over his face and then he stared directly at him. Dean's fingers tightened around his beer bottle. His eyes glued to Castiel's.
He had his green bag over his shoulders, it was straining in his hand. The dirty green bag was practical to have around. Cold air passed through his clothes, his teeth chattering against his skull. Sam unlocked the door with his keys. He took on the light as he continued to walk onwards the house. He sharpened his ears when he recognized two people yelling at each other.
"Dean," he stood immobile in his place.
"If that helps us overthrow God, I am in," Castiel shrugged and looked out the window. He frowned two seconds later. "I heard as well, God took in a new powerful tool by a dying monster. Apparently, killed them like flies."
The archangel's hair was dark beige. His face was sharper than his own the archangel's eyes were grey. They were close to the same height, Dean slightly taller. "Who are you?" Dean asked. He didn't ask for the soldier's status since both knew what the other was.
A wind rustled the trees in the empty echoes of words that would be soon spelled out.
Now they stood a foot apart, Cas sitting while he stood. Dean stopped in front of Cas, his fingers reaching out. "Can we take our time?" Cas asked. Dean restrained himself from touching Cas's shoulder.
"Keep working on your songs and I will do my job," Sam stated. "No hookups, no crazy driving."
Sam didn't wait and immediately appeared in the throne room in hell. Lucifer waited on him. A bored glance in his direction. "You know, commanding the demon army is kinda not my thing," he shrugged. Sam understood that waging a war that had nothing to do with the apocalypse will quickly grow boring. At least, since Lucifer was one of God's earliest creations. Older than himself, actually.
"In the living room," Bobby shouted back.
"She didn't do anything," Haziel answered for her, blocking his path to Anna by pushing her out of his reach. "You were destined to lead, Castiel. Always was. She did everything for us. I hope you will learn to appreciate that."
Anna pressed quickly on the bottoms on her mobile before she showed a video to him. For a few minutes, they sat in silence watching it. Shock, laughter, and confusion soon followed after they were done seeing it."Dean answered my question, live," Castiel smiled brightly. He struggled not to burst into laughter again. "I never realized he would remember such an unimportant detail."
Castiel's lips pressed into a thin line.
"I am sorry, I had some issues to take care of," Haziel replied. Castiel knew he wasn't completely lying although, the matter at hand would make it hard for anyone to understand before later. He chose now.
Castiel tugged his sleeve on his trench coat and looked away. "No, I am capable of handling myself," Castiel said through gritted teeth. He flinched when Bobby put the clean glass down on the counter. He slowly lifted his eyes back at Bobby. "Is just...The job is getting on my nerves lately and my father is expecting I give him things I can't do," he stared down to the glass again.
Bobby stabbed demons from behind, panic erupted at every angel at this point. The monsters were ruthless. Then Sam saw Raphael fly into his personal space, his blade to his throat. Sam smirked before he punched the archangel hard in the stomach, Raphael's eyes widened in shock. The hate bubbled up from the bottom of his heart. This man had destroyed their lives. This man wanted to end a million more. Hell, Raphael broke Dean. Only he got the rights to do that. Sam blocked a punch aimed at his face.
"Camilla wanted us to jam together this evening," Sam said without looking up from the newspaper.
Castiel's head lifted and looked around. Dean shrugged while having his arms crossed. Castiel bit his underlip in concentration. Dean's words echoed in his head I don't trust them. Castiel's numb hands moved on the keyboard.
"I am your family," Castiel said, he raised his eyebrow. He breathed the same air Castiel did, his eyes went unwillingly down to Castiel's lips before his green eyes met Castiel's darker shade of blue. He blinked a few times, he tried to shake the weird feeling in his gut.
"Bitch," Dean said without thinking.
"I don't believe I can," Castiel said each word slowly. He frowned. They needed to know Sam Winchester was on their side or else they might kill him and Dean would never forgive him for that. "Hell is already on our side. Sam Winchester, the newest knight of hell, requested we united against the same enemy. I agreed on his terms."
"Did the cat take your tongue?" Dean smirked. He put the glass on the counter then he rubbed his neck nervously.
"They do," Micheal agreed. "Father is coming right now and I expect you to be at the best of your training Raphael has taught you." Micheal took his arm and flew them out of the building.
"We have talked about this, Dean deserves to be happy. I don't want him to see me when it happens."
cassette, and experiencedly moved the car out to the road. Sam sometimes opened and closed his mouth shortly after. Dean already knew what his brother wanted to ask;
Dean recalled many memories they had shared yet his heart laid in Cas's hand. And would be, for what he considered the rest of his life. He stared for a moment where she had been seconds before and clenched his fist. He felt Cas's hand on his shoulder, he relaxed his shoulder and turned towards Cas.
"Cas, what's wrong? Whatever you say, I won't judge," Dean tried to persuade Cas. His hand was still awkwardly in between them. "What is said here, stays here."
"Well, I am working on an album here and she is distracting," Dean defended himself. He gestured with his hands to prove his point. "Can't focus and stuff," Dean saw Sam definitely did not believe him.
Then he nodded.
Sam thought frustrated to himself.
. He shook his head while his hands clenched.
Castiel took a deep breath and counted inwardly to ten before he answered. "How to play the guitar." From the moment he answered her question, reporters stood up and started shouting. Others in the back took pictures of them. His hands became sweaty and Dean's reassuring shoulder touch sent his blood to his ears. They were only supposed to buy Camilla time with this and clear up things.
He pulled Bobby over his shoulders before he put Bobby into his coach in the living room. Sam stared at who he considered his father figure for a moment before turning away. He began to look for Dean and Castiel. He reached his and Dean's old room. The toilets. Kitchen. Garden. Then, finally the basement.
Once Sam reached his destination he walked out of the bus. To his surprise, it was almost midnight. The crossroad parted ways in three locations, an old building on his left with faded letters on it saying 'The Crimson Bar'. On his right an old tree swaying in the wind. Sam pulled his leather jacket closer around himself, his teeth clattering against his skull.
"I told you," Sam said obviously happy he stole another popcorn from him. A few popcorns flew down to the floor and Dean gave Sam his 2.0-bitch-stare. "Brute force isn't winning when the opposite team is making traps."
Castiel opened his mouth to protest however, Anna's determined eyes stopped him in his tracks so he closed his lips. His eyes narrowed in anger and fear. Again things spin out of control. He saw a million opportunities. Castiel gripped his hair and screamed. He felt a hand on his shoulder and how each particle etched apart and came together again.
A facility with white walls surrounded him as far as Dean saw. In his hand, he held the angel blade safe in his palm. The air chilled his back, Dean glanced at the emerging person Raphael had ordered him to kill because he had disobeyed him once. Apparently, staring at a woman's boobs was a sin. The man Dean faced, wore a beige overcoat, a black suit with matching shoes. His eyes were so blue Dean sometimes caught himself getting lost in them.
"First time I was here I was supposed to meet up alongside my boyfriend, the same night I meet you he up broke with me."
"Good evening Kansas!" Dean welcomed the audience. He could see the white flashing from phones and waves of gluing sticks as far his eyes could see. The scream was muffled out by his earbuds so he didn't become deaf. "I can't hear you, how are you Kansas?"
"How long ago is it since she died?" Sam asked.
The pianist builds up to the bridge of the song, Dean stepped his right foot to the beat. He thought back from when Cas experienced hard times. His fans waved their glowsticks slowly to the beat, in a rainbow before his eyes. "There is nothing like the road ahead. Alone," he sang. Each word stung more than the other. He pointed his finger to his chest before he directed it at his fans.
concert," Sam commented, he was texting on his phone.
Maybe this was a bad idea. Dean almost collided headfirst into a wall when they landed. He furrowed his brows when he noticed the building in front of them. Sam crossed his arms and gave him a nod. "Wait," Dean stopped mid-sentence and started again. "We are going in there?"
"I know," Castiel said before he gestured for a new drink. He felt shitty. Castiel thanked the bartender before he took yet another drink. A warm feeling spread over his whole body and he sighed in delight.
One of the voices Sam could know everywhere was Dean, the other didn't ring any bells in his mind. He walked softly to the room where he and Dean often jammed together. When he opened the door, his hazel eyes widened in surprise. Dean stood gripping tightly into Cas's trenchcoat. Both of them breathed heavily, they didn't seem like they had noticed him.
"Nothing is going to hurt you as long I am around," Dean gave him a short hug. He squeezed Sam's shoulder before a restrained smile covered his face.
Dean moved on his feet and stared confused at Father for a moment. Angels were supposed to feel nothing and do as they were told. The question made no sense for him. Dean thought up an answer he often heard humans tell each other. "Fine."
"...that's right," he said, Sam coughed. His throat sore from all the screaming although, the man seemed to know something he didn't. Concluded to zip out every information the demon had. Sam crawled until he leaned against the warm wall. Sam blinked a few times. Dazed.
Dean froze on his spot, he licked his lips as he seized him up and down. "Me?" Dean said warily. It seemed to Castiel that the moment he saw him, he resumed back into his archangel role but not when it came to his family.
"If there's a bustle in your hedgerow, don't be alarmed now, it's just a spring clean for the May queen. Yes, there are two paths you can go by, but in the long run. There's still time to change the road you're on. And it makes me wonder."
Dean shrugged, "I healed him." Bobby's eyes narrowed at him. He rolled his green apple eyes as he awaited his target. No fucking way he let Bobby think he could boss him around. That was reserved for the Father. Castiel moved just as Dean suspected he would. Dean waited patiently. Castiel walked into his proximity and Dean acted.
"Hello Dean," Castiel answered while he walked over to Dean. His breath hitched in his throat. Castiel avoided eye contact with Dean. His hands became full of sweat and he rubbed his hands together. Castiel's eyes landed on the guitar, he had never played one himself.
"A path held by us, chosen for us," Dean whispered. He had gotten into the music in such a way, the crowd was nothing but a distant memory. In his mind, Cas stood in front of him instead of the fans. He took a deep breath then he got to the highest notes of the song. "Home is you. Let me rest, on your bones," Dean sat on the chair, he put his hands to the front of the chair. At the same time, his feet laid lazy on the other parts of it.
"Resources has to be usefully placed to have the effect we want," Dean informed the archangel. He straightened his back.
They ended up in the backseat. None of them drove and Dean didn't mind waiting. His chest ached with love and he could see it reflected in Dean's gaze. In the silence, the meaning began to glue itself to his heart. He would never love another man as Dean Winchester. He leaned against the window, his fists clenched. A voice in the back of his mind reminded him time wasn't on his side...
"I am."
He nodded; Balthazar wasn't wrong about that.
The demon frowned. For a short moment, her eyes turned red before they went back to their original color.
"Yeah, I know." Dean adjusted the little device so he could keep track of the songs during the concert and put on one of the earbuds. He pressed the bottoms until he had the volume he wanted.
Curses ran through his head like bullets. Time passed for an eternity. When Sam breath a new, his bones were amended into something new. His very mind was different. Cruel. Deadlier. Sam opened his eyes, now flashed to black for one second before they returned to their hazel color. Lucifer raised him on the table. Sam leaned into Lucifer's shoulders, exhausted.
"No thank you, I am here to apologize for my friend's rude behavior towards you," Castiel said politely.
Castiel shocked expression made Dean smile proud of himself. Their fists collided together rapidly. Dean dodged a punch at his shoulder. Castiel grabbed him by the shoulders. Dean didn't lose any time to kick him in the groin. Castiel's blue eyes narrowed at him. He used his hand to slash through Castiel's trenchcoat, then Castiel's arm shot forward and twisted it to his left side.
Fear. Anger. Flashed through Dean's body. His body was frozen in the hallway, he couldn't make himself open the damn door.
He searched on the internet for hellhounds. The name itself made him shiver in fear but he was not the kind of man to show it. Sam had researched for hours before he had found a believable source that he was looking for. Earlier, Dean had gone off to the bar again not that he minded.
He wiped off the sweat from his forehead, his arms hurt from bearing heavy back and forth for a few hours. The sweat dripped down to his dark blue cheap t-shirt. He saw Sam and Bobby discussing something. Bobby had an upset look on his face and Sam kept gesturing his hands like he did when was proving a point. This had been going on for half an hour since the last time Dean checked his watch.
One was for an interview and the other was from the producer. Shortly after Sam got a message from Dean's girlfriend. He rolled his eyes.
Castiel looked down and fidgeted with his hand in his pocket. Dean was a rock star he was a nobody. Their worlds were too different, for everything he knew Dean had gotten news of starting acting. Castiel had loved Dean's voice from the first time he heard his single
Cas smiled again, butterflies erupted in his stomach. "Promise?" He said after he had caught his breath back.
Sam felt the power of demon blood surge forward to attempt to heal his wounds.
Dean went to the Press area, he talked about his new album
"To explain it, I have to use terms you aren't familiar with. I wish for your best," Anna said. Her eye flicked around the bar. Anna's whole body language changed once Castiel saw she noticed Dean walking towards them.
Sam glanced at him. "Cas, huh? Did you get an upgrade?" His face filled with blood he wiped away from his features. "I would give you a hug but I am drenched," Sam smirked now, a darker version of Sam Castiel never witnessed before.
Torture. Castiel's yarning grew from each day that passed. He kept his mouth closed and didn't say anything unless they asked him. Sam had begun to give him worried glances his way. The tension between the brothers also affected him (even if he wouldn't be caught alive saying that).
That perked Sam's interest. His brother has been the first on his mind. "When will I able to go?"
His heart thrummed loudly in his ears. Dean felt trapped. If he walked in they would act as if nothing had happened or shift the topic. Dean clenched his fist and breath through his nose to calm down his heartbeat.
"Is a long story, really, I lost both of my parents when I was young. For a year I was mute, I-I was only a kid back then. The music saved me and now I will save people with my music." Dean's voice hid pain.
Dean smiled when he got the response he wanted. He walked forward to the middle of the stage, Dean spoke softly into the microphone. "This song I wrote during the world tour and you will be the first one to hear it. I dedicated this song to my family for helping me get this far. It's called
Right then, Castiel's phone decided to ring for an incoming message. He gave Dean an apologetic glance before he unlocked the message. It was from Anna. He forgot about her, a bad deja vu suddenly was everywhere he turned. How could he forget her in all this?
Sam stepped forward. "I do," he said simply. Castiel put a hand on Sam's shoulder and gestured for him to retreat. Sam followed Castiel's example rapidly. He guessed nobody wanted to die by Castiel's hands.
"What inspired you to become an artist?"
"You are right, Haziel, he is. The God we have been waiting for has finally arrived," Anna told the group. Castiel walked warily closer to the crowd but not before glancing at Anna first.
is dedicated to a friend, he has been there for me more than he realizes. That's the new single. You ready?" He grinned. The whole place exploded into sounds and light.
"I do," Castiel said completely serious.
Castiel looked away and took a deep breath. One of the reasons Castiel had always been a big fan of Dean was because Dean always poured his soul and heart into his songs. Unlike the more mainstream artist those days. He had never imagined that he would actually meet him.
"The boy-king himself," Crowley said. He stood up from the chair before he appeared in front of Sam. He didn't flinch, when he was lazy he did the same thing. Just to scare his souls a bit before the actual thing.
He bites his nails as he studied the music sheet in front of him. Dean knew playing the guitar was a simple idea. The hard part, to make Cas comfortable around him, he stood up from the chair. Dean picked up his phone as he checked through his messages with his finger. He put the phone in his pocket before he cleaned up his mess from earlier.
He turned to watch Dean before his soul left his body. Sam's body stopped moving, his hazel eyes staring blindly at the ceiling. His last heartbeat short after as he began his journey to the next place his brother couldn't reach him; hell.
Castiel stood up and changed to a black suit, dark blue tie with white stripes, and ebony-colored shoes. He straightened his tie and checked the time. Later Castiel ate breakfast with Camilla and Sam. They talked about the usual things.
Bobby turned towards him. "Dean, he has been helping me out a few hours today, you didn't need to come." He took off his baseball hat. Bobby held it tight in his hands. Bobby's blue eyes met his green ones for a moment. Something in Bobby's eyes made Dean more confused but he decided not to think about it.
He refused to believe a God would love an archangel as himself. It wasn't right. Dean's hands clenched, his breath heavy in his lungs. Castiel wiped the blood off from his temple, his blue eyes determined in his direction. Dean took one step back, his eyes flickered towards the exit.
"Is that so?" A silent threat in his voice that Sam recognized quickly. He lifted his hand but did not gesture for any attack...Yet. He waited with tensed shoulders and hammering heart. Everything he had ever done, depended on what events will be put into play at this moment.
Dean shrugged the thought off. He settled behind a huge, thick tree as his eyes followed their movements. Castiel nodded to Anna before they started to walk just outside the tree line where Dean was.
," Anna's voice said to him. Unconsciously his hands clenched the wheel tighter. He gave himself time to order his thoughts. Castiel breathed heavily out. "
He grits his teeth and turned away. "No."
," Dean rubbed his face and stared down. His shoulders slumped in defeat. Castiel waited. Dean took his hand over his. His eyes almost dark green as the woods they had driven past before that day. "You know, I thought you didn't want anything from me. Other than me helping you out. But now I am not sure anymore."
Castiel's feet moved on their own record that way he ended straight in front of Dean. He counted Dean's freckles. His gaze suddenly stared down to Dean's lips then back up again. "I will not kiss a woman as you call it, Mr.Winchester. But I won't mind going out." The air tensed around them, hugging tight as a lover's kind hands touched her long lost man. Dean grabbed his arm and took the keys.
He gasped out in surprise when he opened his eyes again. Castiel's body was still shaking from shock.
Sam turned to the television Cas had taken on a few minutes earlier. Obviously, it was already spreading. Just as his days were coming to an end. And Dean didn't know, he would never have any idea. It was better that way. Before in the day, he contacted Bobby and he kept telling there he couldn't be saved.
"That's great," Sam cleared his throat. Dean's surprised eyes met his, so trusting.
So human.
"We kept looking for a dead God. keeping mercy by our shores," Dean turned serious. Both of his hands united around the microphone. He let out the caged fury he kept under leash most of his time. "O' father, I found the love of my life in her arms." Instead of thinking of his girlfriend Camilla like he usually did, he remembered Cas's awkward talks. His clear blue eyes as if the sky had opened in them. The freedom that was waiting to be set free if he dared to open them.
and finally, when dad gave to him Baby's car keys on his eighteen birthday.
"There's a feeling I get when I look to the west, and my spirit is crying for leaving. In my thoughts, I have seen rings of smoke through the trees, And the voices of those who stand looking," Castiel's voice shook, his music faltered a bit. Warm tears made his vision blurry to see Dean's grave ahead of him.
His dark brown hair messed up, then Dean heard the voice. "You don't have to do this," the man said. Dean rolled his eyes and punched the replica to the ground. Blood coughed out of the copy's mouth. Then without hesitation, Dean stabbed the man. Raphael kept referring to the copy as 'Castiel' who that was, Dean didn't know.
"Why?" Camilla wiped away tears from her eyes. "I thought we were supposed to get married a-and..." She looked down to the floor and Cas's hand touched Dean's shoulder. Dean's shoulders relaxed and Dean lets out a quiet sigh.
Sam hyperventilated when he arose from his bed. His phone alarmed loudly in the quiet idea, Sam picked up the phone. The called id, was, of course, his big brother. He mentally prepared himself before he answered the call. "Dean," Sam simply said. He heard the sounds of a muffled protest of Cas's voice in the background.
A few hours after staring that even made him in his drunk state wary, both of them fell asleep on one another. Intense light warned Dean the morning had begun. He rubbed his eyes, he frowned a moment later when he realized his pillow was hard. Dean blinked. His hand touched...Cas body, suddenly he flinched back to the other side of the car. His head collided with the window. A short bang echoed in the car. An ache spread through his brain and he grits his teeth together.
'," he informed Dean in his normal manner.
"Okay, I have a song done, I call it
Cas squeezed his back, his eyes blazed in a neon blue color before they went back to a dark shade of blue. The amulet laid beside their bodies.
He sat in his room, Dean regretted sending Cas the message but it was too late to do anything about it now. The weather had suddenly changed a few minutes after Cas left his house. Sam definitely would know about it, however, he didn't give a crap. Ten minutes passed and he threw the phone to his bedside. He rubbed his eyes before Dean stood up. Doing nothing made his skin crawl. Quickly he walked to Sam's room.
Light shone on the familiar stage. Around him, the other artist was ready when Dean was to begin. A smile formed on his face. This is what life is worth living for. Glow sticks match the lights where he stood. People screamed. Dean held tight around his microphone, his green eyes twinkled from the shots from cameras. In a tiny moment, he lifted the microphone to under his lips. "Kansas, I am back."
Dean's eyes turned to his audience once more. His tune rose in strength. "There is nothing like the road ahead. Alone. Fighting? Baiting. We left in time, to collide. Hell sings its last words, to a man that doesn't care. We are all human here." This time, his fans sang with him. It warmed into his very soul. A tear drilled down his cheek. Dean wiped it off with his palm. With the little bit of water on his hand, he looked at it for a second before he brushed it off on his black jeans.
"Sam," Castiel greeted the person, Sam nodded and moved towards him. Dean's feet got away quicker than light could reach him. "I found Dean, and I did expect you here," he continued as if Dean's reaction were just part of his plan.
They attacked and dodges for days. Yet Raphael kept pushing Dean to his limits. Dean never thought about who he was until Father stood by his side again. By then the angel's moral was knocked into his mind as a tale of truth.
Because to him, he found Haziel's nervousness to be unlike him. He raised his eyebrow slightly at them. "They are attacking our current borders as I told you earlier. The monsters are willing to take your side in exchange for you don't kill any."
At that moment Dean decided to walk in, he smiled a smile that didn't reach his eyes. "Is there pie left? I need pie," Dean said casually.
He had lied, to Castiel, of course. Some parts were true but not all. Outside a warehouse building guarded by the most extreme monsters except the kind like himself. Sam touched the Blade to relax his shivering palm. It pulsed inside his veins to kill again. However, to gain control over the lust to do so was much better worth the struggle than not.
"But," Cas rubbed his backhead, a sigh escaped his lips. "Did you want me to bend you over?"
Somehow Castiel made him question things he had never questioned in his life. The stuff he wanted to forget. Dean sat down on a chair, his hands held tight to the guitar. He closed his eyes to let the music inside his heart speak for him where he had no words. Dean's fingers flew over the strings hesitating at first but more and more confident after a while.
"That's great," she smiled. Camilla sat, in front of the piano turned towards him and Sam.
Castiel took a glass and filled it with water. He willed his cock to calm down. Castiel felt unsure, usually, God gave him a mission to complete. But lately, he had gotten nothing. And the information Dean informed him about warned him it was barely beginning. Fear showed in Castiel's clear sky blue eyes.
"You never tell me about what—"
Sam saw his opening and walked over to Lucifer easily. "No problem," he said. His hand twitched over his Blade again. Lucifer raised his eyebrow at his move. "I want to kill more monsters," he said. "Demon blood would be great too," he added.
Sam shrugged. He tapped his finger twice on one of
The grass waved silently in the winds around him. He stood with Dean's guitar in his hand. Trees leaves flew around in the warm air. Behind Castiel's back, men and women were dressed in black like the custom were. Flowers in different rainbow colors surrounded him from every direction. A reminder of life. The gravestone stood in its gray colors. Castiel crunched down, his hand touched the letters of Dean's name.
Sam thought. He leaned against the wall, a thousand options blazed through his mind. He needed to be elsewhere once the day arrived and none should be able to follow him. The sunlight painted the walls in colors, the cars began outside to be noisy by the morning rush.
"Your first time? Such a virgin you are. I have met people with smaller brains than yours. What do you want? Fortune? Fame?" She gestured with her hands.
"Pulling a kamikaze," Dean said under his breath. He let himself be guided by his emotions. His other hand took Cas's tie until they were inches apart. Dean saw it as a victory by how aroused Cas became by that action alone. Dean raised his eyebrow and smirked. "Such a shame, man," Dean lowered his tone. Dark. Sexy. Just how girls wanted it sometimes.
He flew back to where he had been. However, the cafe only held a few humans eating. Dean began to track the grace he could catch, he followed Castiel's track like a bloodhound. Dean moved silently, no twinge of any plant made him visible. In the far distance, Haziel flew away from Castiel and Anna.
That left Dean with his thoughts. His feelings were still in turmoil and he wasn't sure what to believe anymore. Castiel talked as if he already knew him. That struck him as odd. However, he also had to follow orders.
"What are you?" He hissed. Castiel blanked out for two full seconds before a strangled sound escaped his throat.
"Of course, being in the shadow. Not that it's important, what brings you here?" Balthazar shrugged.
"No," he said to nobody in particular. The alarms blasted on full volume and it made him blink to get his painful headache to lessen. Lights in front of him went on and off. He noted he needed to fix the other light. Castiel took his hand to his head and after stared down at his palm. His hair was filled with shattered glass, it stung and he hissed when he touched the bruises. Blood dripped down from his head to his lap.
She closed into him and before Sam could protest he felt her lips against his own. The kiss was short but it still left him breathless.
hair Dean concluded while his smile broadened. Cas stared at him for a few seconds. "Hello Dean," Cas answered in his low voice.
Castiel took the paper as put it down in his pocket. "Why not open it now?" Castiel asked he frowned in confusion. Sam leaned against the cold surface. He and Haziel exchanged a glance before he saw Haziel pull his whole attention toward Castiel.
, isn't that right?"
Dean opened the door and greeted Gabriel on the way. The guy never seemed to need sleep for some reason he filtered that information to ask him later. Dean opened up the trunk and took out his guitar, he patted it softly with his fingers before he lifted it completely.
"Why should he?" Dean took out his car keys from his brown leather jacket. "There is chaos, destruction, and violence. God has been lazy if you ask me," Dean's hands curled around the keys. "Sammy is worrying me," Castiel heard Dean mumble underneath his breath.
"My father" Dean gulped "taught me that saving people is important, that means helping."
In truth, Sam lied to Crowley earlier about the demon blood. He had no recollection of ever drinking the blood he talked about. His heartbeat until it hurt inside his chest. The door opened again. A young man with dirty blonde hair, pale, healthy body, and gray eyes walked into his prison cell.
Sam nodded if she planned to backstab on him, Haziel would know about it. Their relationship worked both ends. Lucifer would be difficult, demons all around the US feared the guy unlike they were higher ranking like himself. They departed in different directions after that.
Castiel stared at the bottles lined up in front of him. He tried to think rationally.
"Different? We are just starting. You are not yet a Knight of Hell, that would be too easy. No, I will be sending you to the racks."
Sam cleared his throat before he slowly put the bag down. It's rustling only thing that broke the tension between his big brother and friend. Dean moved away from Cas as if he had been burned while Cas's blue eyes blazed with emotions. "Dean, what's happening?" Sam finally made himself ask.
He went down to the garden, on the backside to get privacy. To be personal with music had never been a problem until now...
Michael's presence was clear to him, he could recognize the sound of the wings everywhere. Dean held his gaze downcast. He attempted to clear his mind from his feelings. Harder than he anticipated. "Dean," Michael said.
"What's mysterious about porn?" Dean raised one eyebrow. Castiel looked at Dean confused. Dean waited for his answer while he did his best to not punch Dean right at that moment.
The angel frowned now but slowly a glint in the vessel's eyes told him, the angel got it. "I understand, you plan on seizing them when they least expect it? I can talk to my squad about it and see what I can do."
He spat Raphael in the face. "You deserve to die," Sam hissed. His fist collided into the man's groin but Raphael twisted his arm at an unnatural angle. Sam used his feet to do a round kick to his stomach. Raphael let go.
Dean followed quickly up to his little brother, he waved at Gabriel before he entered Baby. "Before or after the jam?"
"It isn't," Micheal said. "We have a mission in planning and not anyone can take it. Our Father will be able to tell you more. And also, clean up your mess," Micheal ordered.
On the other hand, Dean never gave up on him. He had every reason to but didn't. Castiel clenched and unclenched his palms. He went into the living room and put on the tv. Surprisingly his encounter on his way home was stated in the news. Though the news lady focused more on the unusual weather. His mobile beeped. A message from Dean.
A white light lit up from within.
"Sure Dean," Sam answered. They walked to the car, Camilla clung to him like a rag doll. He tried desperately not to show how uncomfortable it made him feel. Cas didn't say a word from then, however, he avoided his gaze. The tension rose although none seem to react to it.
They had this discussion many times, yet he never got any answer to his questions. It unsettled him deeply. Once again a silence reached new thickness in the air. Before Castiel could muster up an answer Anna had shut off the call. Castiel rolled his crystal clear blue eyes.
"Damn it," his fist hit the wheel, his teeth grit together when the burning pain reached him. A short distraction. He wiped the tears away. Nothing appealed to him anymore. Not the music that helped when nothing else did. Or Dean could buy whatever he wanted.
Sam restrained himself from rolling his eyes. "Fine," he said through grit teeth. His hand covered an oozing wound that hurt like hell. A thousand needles of white agony never seemed to end. Lucifer dragged him up from the floor. His strength surprised Sam for a moment. They put a few meters distance between them.
Castiel sighed. "It's the best choice, Father got the archangels and unknown allies, we got to be careful who we trust. And I trust Sam."
He sent a few more messages before Anna didn't answer him. Dean stood now staring over his shoulder. "Whar's up with her?" Dean's skeptical voice dragged him out of his thoughts. Castiel had to talk with the bodyguards, they seemed to know more than they let on.
Sam thought.
. "Around midnight, I will help you to write poetry. Just don't disturb me when I am sleeping," Castiel answered his friend on the phone. Anna laughed at the other end. The feeling of been exposed dispatched.
He heard the surprised gasped when they discovered what he had done.
"No, she didn't," Dean said, a wave of underlying anger in his voice. He folded his hands. Dean answered a few more questions before the journalists turned towards him again. He felt Dean's gaze on him and swallowed thickly.
Castiel paid the bill and drove to his father's church. He used a few hours to clean the church altar and took a break around midnight. The darkness surrounded him when he stared at the mobile number again.
The hallways were lit up by a claret in the ceiling, the surfaces in a dark black color. Under his moving feet, the floor was gray. Understandable enough, the air crisped in his mouth as usual. For how long they walked down the corridors, Sam didn't know. Could be hours. Days, maybe only mere minutes.
Dean looked up irritated at his brother." What?! Why didn't you tell me yesterday?"
"It's about your life. Take it seriously, people won't hesitate to get a piece of you now. And with your brother dead..." Gabriel's brown widened. "Where did you get that amulet?"
Dean looked startled up at her; Cas had asked a similar question yesterday. He thought out a satisfying answer, in a way he hoped it would reach his fans."As you may know, my childhood was rough. I found peace in music, it saved me in a way I hope my music will do," Dean said honestly to the interviewer.
The cold around him made his teeth shatter against his skull. Still, the darkness surrounded him as he swallowed the thick blame. Castiel's bright blue eyes laid on the biblical pictures of Jesus, he turned to the door. He straightened up and let his gaze look at the person coming in.
A flash of air and Castiel stood in front of him. "You really don't remember anything we did together?" Castiel said. Dean eyed him in suspicion, the blood rushed loudly in his ears. What the hell was he even talking about? It didn't add up. "Or what about, you never were created the same time as your fellow angels? Your brother? Forgotten him too?" Castiel laughed.
"No," Dean said stubbornly. "I got no idea where you get these things but they are not true." Castiel's eyes narrowed at him. He attempted to shake off the constant reminder of
"I am aware. However,  I would refrain from making an irrational choice in your state. I suppose I can't do much. Angels are watching over you, and I will too," Castiel reassured Dean at his best of his abilities. Dean nodded.
He took a step forward, his hand outstretched but stopped halfway. "I am so sorry," he mumbled. "You are right, I wasn't thinking straight. But I love him, Camilla. I want you to have the life you want. And I can help you have it, trust me. I will. Your dreams can still come reality," he said. Dean took a deep breath. He said the words out loud that had been on his mind for months. It was thrilling. Yet scary.
"This is..." Sam took a deep breath he no longer needed. The power pulsed through his veins, ready to let loose and kill, rip apart murder, and blood lust. Sam moved away from Lucifer, his hand covered half of his face. The senses were stronger than ever and he was dizzy.
Lucifer seemed proud of him while Crowley's eyes frickled around in the room. The sign, Sam knew was a sign of weakness. Lucifer took up his sleeve, the crimson Mark on his arm as a crescent with small strips on top of it. Before Crowley could say anything more Lucifer took hold of his arm.
"He gets you, even a fool can see that,"
Sam gave him an irritated stare. Once again, the age was random, the marks the same, no sign of a struggle. The pieces were far from being solved in his thoughts. However, Sam began to see a pattern he previously hadn't seen. "Did she do a ritual to call angels?"
It tasted almost sweet on his tongue, he licked his lips. Swiftly he locked up his car. He sat down on the seat, Castiel's mind working quickly. He knew he must tell someone about what was going on. The car rumbled underneath his ass once he started the vehicle, he tapped the wheel proudly. Castiel disappeared into the night, never once looking back. With one hand on the steering wheel while he texted in the number to Anna on the other.
This part would be a difficult one.
Dean wiped away the tears from his eyes. "Nothing, is just I have never met someone like you." Dean continued to laugh for a few minutes more.
Sam moved to catch Camilla's hand but Dean's now open eyes told him not to. He grits his teeth in frustration. She gripped hold of Dean's leather jacket, Camilla leaned her head against his chest. She sobbed. Dean patted her scalp and hugged her and muttered words into her ear. "I am so sorry," Dean kept repeating.
Cas squeezed his shoulder. Dean nuzzled into his warm chest and sighed. His hands wrapped around Cas. The grip like steel. "Do you ever plan to become an artist again?"
and what had inspired him, and so on. Dean smiled at how oblivious they were. Kept asking about stupid things Dean really cared any less for. After what Dean checked later was three hours, he went to the backside of the stage. Where Cas stood to wait for him.
"No comment," Dean said, he scolded his face to show no emotions even though, the red corners of his eyes said otherwise. He kept his voice neutral but a small shiver of panic slipped through anyway.
After half an hour the bus appeared. Sam found his place and sat down on one of the hard seats. Only an old woman around her sixties was on the bus, her frown appeared on her face. Sam looked anxiously out the window. His eyes narrowed at the street signs they were passing.
God opened his mouth to respond, however, Raphael, the nasty bastard he was answered instead. "Don't be stupid, there is only one God that matters. Is Chuck and not you. An apocalypse is set into motion and we can't have you interfering," Raphael got a nod from Michael. Lucifer's jaw tightened. Crowley merely seemed to be bored. Cas shook his head but a glint blazed in his eyes.
"Whatever," Sam responded. The empty room held many secrets Sam's eyes had taught him to uncover. For example, Crowley never left without his angel blade. There were papers on the deals going on up at the earth. Demon population and all that boring shit. Lucifer didn't seem to mind yet.
"Let him explain," Sam said. He nodded towards his big brother. Dean and Cas exchanged a glance even Sam couldn't decipher what went through their eyes. Dean walked in front of Cas as if protecting from Camilla's wrath. Sam put his hands in his pockets. He was ready to interfere when needed to.
. "I want Anna to take my place as a leader while I am gone. You will be in her second in command, Haziel. Sam would manage to keep you updated. In the meantime, I will track Dean up."
"Sam, the only monster here is you," Raphael extended his arm, Sam smashed into a tree. Stars appeared behind his eyelids, pain burned like fire up his back. Cut. Needled. The yells continued around, as well as the fighting exalted in pressure. The words carved themselves into his heart.
Sam opened the door to Bobby's house. He heard the sounds of plates and tableware. Sam's hair was ruffled from the fight. His hand clung to his green plaid, blood dripped down from his wound. His view was blurred around the edges and his head beat harshly towards his skull. The flaring ice of a thousand knives was through his stomach and he struggled to keep himself standing. His right hand painted a crimson line of blood through the walls in a straight line.
Castiel's ocean blue eyes stared at him. Dean immediately got a cold chill down his back. How long had he been able to see him? Castiel must have played him somehow. Involuntarily his breath left his lungs. Anna already began to charge towards him but Castiel did an unexpected turn as he took her and flung her five meters away.
"I should have told you," he told her. Dean rubbed his neck and avoided staring at Camilla. His hands were taken into his pockets. His emotions ruled over his face. Dean knew more than their relationship was at stake and he wanted to at least assure her he would help her dream. No matter how small that help is.
Something flickered across Dean's green eyes, an emotion of conflict."I am good," Dean answered and smiled a thin smile.
Dean realized he had slept in the clothes from yesterday.
"You know, people are going to stare—" Dean started before he stopped midsentence and when he got a glass of beer and drank it. His eyes twinkled in the light. "Why you don't make a zip of the beauty you got there Cas?" Dean pointed at his bottle of alcohol.
Castiel's face was illuminated by the mobile's light blue glow. He had a hard time believing that the rock star Dean Winchester had given him the number so many fans wanted to themselves.
They entered the bar and asked for drinks. Dean found seats in the back and Sam went for the drinks. He told Camila about how the world tour had been, he experienced outside America. For awhile the two of them — that being Sam and Camilla listened closely to his stories.
. Castiel bit his bottom lip. It wasn't planned but Dean's eyes have been alluring. How his confidence in his every stride before he had gone for a hug. He had been lost in the moment and his body acted on the ache the heart had ached for. Dean's lips were softer than what Castiel imagined. His body strong against his own.
Castiel becomes very aware of his own body at the same moment. He hoped that Dean hadn't noticed him. His heartbeat even quicker against his ribcage.
Gabriel nodded; "He will meet you backstage after the concert, last time I saw him he was talking with your producer."
"Dean." He tried again.
He opened his palm on Rachael's chest, from the outside it seemed like nothing but Sam used the Mark's darkness to corrupt Rachael's light, he staggered backward but he took hold of Sam and dragged him down. The glint of a blade was one of the things Sam witnessed to cut into his flesh. A scream boiled out from Sam. His hands grabbed it and attempted to take it out. He heard Dean's footsteps.
Castiel eased into him. He must have used some sort of magic trick since his hole was slick. Dean took a deep breath. Then he lifted his eyes to Castiel in total fascination. Castiel smirked at him and began to thrust into him. The pain made him grabbed the sheets so as not to fall over. His body was so full he could burst, however, the ache in his chest suddenly let go from his chest. Dean was safe in his own head after months.
"Shut up!" Dean yelled. An annoyed glare was aimed his way. Sam looked at him with his innocent puppy dog eyes, pretending he had done nothing wrong.
Michael raised his hand and Dean became quiet. "No, you do as you are told."
"Dean," he merely managed to say before his brain decided to shut off when Dean kissed him on the lips. Desperation is unsaid in every move. His dick twitched in his boxers. Dean would be the death of him. Castiel finally convinced himself to push Dean away before he decided to fuck him senseless right there and then. "Damn it, Dean," panic slipped into his voice.
The guilt was feasting on his emotions. As if the whole world weighed down on his young shoulders. Dean fought from the daze in his head. A lazy smile in the tears he shed. He could practically hear his brother say
. When Cas's words left his mouth, Dean turned the music higher. His knuckles white on the steering wheel, Dean did his best to keep the panic and fear from showing on his face.
Lucifer tightened some ropes above his neck and chest. "Making you ready for the prom."
Sam leaned back to his seat again. Meg's lips twitched into a smile. "What do I get from this?" She grinned fully now. He always had hated her back in hell, now? He loathed her. But there were desperate times. Sam knew not all demons were bad and needed a second chance. Unlike Dean, that right now believed everything in black and white.
"We got time to see where he is, Dean. We will find him. God gives the greatest tests on the man," Castiel said, he gripped hold of Dean's arm and dragged him up from the chair. Dean opened and closed his mouth like a goldfish but in the end, decided not to say anything. However, a frown became apparent on Dean's face.
Sam saw the monsters froze in their movements before a silent nod was exchanged between them. He peeked further from the tree he was behind. The brown a contrast to his black eyes. He listened to the conversation.
"One beer," Dean said before he turned towards him. With his other hand, he put the guitar softly against the counter.
There was a restaurant close by and there was a small amount of walking. He ate effectively. Sam felt the presence of someone by his side. Slowly he moved his gaze up from his salad, Sam's hazel eyes narrowed when he saw who it was. Balthazar of all people. "Oh, this is rather unexpected," Balthazar said with his thick British accent.
She pouted. "Fine, we seal the deal with a kiss. I will give you ten years before I will come to collect your soul."
Dean excused himself and sat in front of the interesting man. The man's hands fist themselves together. An awkward silence passed, neither willing to break it. Dean took a sip from his beer and cleared his throat before he managed to make an understandable sentence he was disrupted.
Anna took her hand above his, her dark blue eyes never left his face. "Castiel, it's either Dean or a next date that will get you nowhere."
Bobby stood up to attack him, he guessed but Castiel grabbed his arm. The two exchanged a glance before Bobby relaxed his muscles. "Dean," he breathed, he coughed. Blood hit his palms, damn it, that angel had been a pain in the ass. Panic rose in his chest. Could he trust them? At this moment they had the possibility to kill him.
The last words went on repeat. Does Dean want to kill Cas? Sam struggled to believe that. However, by the way, Castiel acted, it wasn't fake. Sam's eyes flickered to black for a second. Rage boiled in his veins. He believed Dean left that behind when he left him with Bobby. His hands clenched. Screw the angels. They deserved to die every single one of them to make his big brother this way.
"An angel of the lord," Anna deadpanned. "Was," she was quick to correct herself.
A soft hand touched his neck and tilted him in Anna's direction. Her face went out and in of focus. "What do you think?"
He could practically imagine Dean rolling his eyes at his behavior. Sam unlocked the door and opened the door. It creaked under his pressure. The white wooden walls were full of dirt and he frowned when the stank of dirt hit his nostrils. Sam found a table at the back of the room and took out his jars of salt. Dean gave him a weird look and he shrugged. Then he found a big spoon he bought a few days prior and began to put the salt on the door and window frames.
"You are right, it's certainly much information your brother isn't sharing," Castiel stated. He rested his head towards Dean's comfortable shoulder. A perfect fit. That was the moment Dean's brother Sam Winchester decided to show up, he had one bag in one hand and walked quickly to the exit. Castiel's sky blue eyes widened and he shoved Dean to make him see. "Dean," he hissed.
Sam began to change clothes to a flannel shirt and dark blue jeans. He needed time to think. "I am fine," Sam lied. The line went quiet on the other end. Sam finished packing before he paid the Motel as Sam headed towards the car. First, then Dean answered again.
"Great, I talk with him and you help me out later.
"He is not supposed to know," Sam answered determinedly.
Tears streamed down his cheeks. Dean sniffed. His nails dug into his skull. Dean tried to shut up the thoughts to no avail. The voices in his head grew into a crescendo. "Shut up," Dean begged quietly, his scalp pained him more. He took deep breaths, his heart raced in his ribs. The idea of not been able to save his brother, destroyed something inside him.
Cas frowned before his fingers ghosted over the same string as him. His finger barely touched the string yet a lighter tone than Dean had made surrounded them for a few seconds. "It wasn't the correct way," Cas tried again, this time copying Dean's method. A perfect deep sound echoed in the room.
. Not that he wanted to, having the Mark seemed like fun.
"Sorry—" He started before he was cut off.
The wind grew stronger around him. Dean's feet were getting wet from the rain that streamed down. He overlooked the building once before going. More than five different cars were parked on the west side of the building. Another angel watched the guard there while some others arrived through other means.
Then he clapped and rubbed his hands together. Lucifer laughed, a chill ran descended his spine.
Who that was, he didn't know.
Colors surrounded him, and he moved through places as easily as butter. He kept sure no tails were on him when he arrived at Bobby's. He was surprised to see the lights were on, he recognized Dean's voice immediately and Bobby's rustling from weapons. Castiel made himself appear in the room.
He tapped his other palm on the back of the guitar as he kept the beat. Castiel continued. His eyes blind to the world and remembered the little stuff he and Dean did together when Dean was alive.
"We?" Castiel breathed out. He coughed, red-colored the white sheets. Frustration showed in his features. He turned towards Anna or whatever she said she was. Angel or not, he didn't care. Anna is his friend no matter, Castiel refused to think otherwise.
"I don't trust them," Dean said bluntly. "I researched Sam's stuff and found out about hellhounds but they don't exist, do they? Though, Sammy acted weird before this. His notebook has that evidence."
"I can't believe it worked," Sam said stunned.
What he saw, love without no hinder. He titled his head slightly and their lips met in a sweet kiss. Pain flared up his lip and made his hand held tighter onto Cas's trenchcoat. He opened his mouth for the first time tasting Cas's tongue against his own. His blood boiled south. Dean pushed Cas away, his face flushed. Cas's eyes stared into his in confusion.
Castiel bit his lip until he drew blood, the pain as a weaker to his dying body. He wished whatever he so was illusions of his own mind created to make him cope with his loss. "That's hard to understand," Castiel started choking and Anna was quick to be by his side.
Tomorrow was the day everything changed as far as Dean knew.
"Cas," Dean laughed. "You have been staring at me for the last five minutes," he rubbed his forehead before he let his hand on his lap. Castiel blinked. He opened and closed his mouth a few times before he managed to say something through his drugged daze consisting of flying angels.
"I will take a flight to do my dreams, and I am going to try to get into my school I have always wished to get into. Castiel, it's nice seeing you, however, my time here has come to an end and it's over between me and Dean," she smiled bravely to them. After that, she said goodbye and went out.
. The song
"Really?" Dean raised one of his eyebrows. "Because I remember I won tackling you to the ground and guess what? I am right."
how much he
Dean realized he had drunk up his bottle and looked dumbfound at it for a few seconds. "Thanks," he simply said.
"Protect me from what exactly?" Dean walked over to him, curiousness is written all over his face. Dean trailed his fingers through the demon knife of his. A confused glare directed at its engravings.
"You can carry out the packages to the car outside, Sam took half of them already," Bobby's voice broke his short daydream.
"Nine, also you got an interview today," Sam made his serious face."No porn on the interview, you know what happened last time."
"You are playing a dangerous game, Demon," the angel responded after some thought and took the page inside her jacket. Her blue eyes looked him over for a moment. The air electrified around them. "Whatever the consequences may be, it will have sacrifices." Then the rustle of wings before the angel was gone.
Dean's back hit the refrigerator, their lips parted for a moment. Castiel panted. "Missed you," Dean said before he began to take off Castiel's overcoat. His breath hitched. Dean's hands were everywhere on him. Each touch lit a fire inside he didn't know he had. Dean's lips kissed his neck and him groan out in pleasure. His hips bucked forward.
"Heya Sammy," Dean hugged tight around Sam before letting him go. "What's up?" Dean asked casually.
"I am sorry," Dean lied without meaning it but it worked his magic.
The cold air ghosted around him when he walked down the old wooden stairs. Sam glanced around in the room. Here Bobby had things stored for spells, more lore, maps, reserve food, and so on. Bobby thought of everything. One of the reasons he saw Bobby as one of the best hunters he knew. He had heard about a legend once as a child. Men of Letters they were called, nobody thought they existed (the same way, it was a collective truth within the community Big Foot wasn't real).
"Your head is humming and it won't go, in case you don't know, the piper's calling you to join him, dear lady, can you hear the wind blow, and did you know, your stairway lies on the whispering wind?" Dean's eyes held an intense pain for a second before it was gone.
Sam stood finally in a big cabin his big brother sometimes took him to when he was eight years old. The walls were made of thick wood that covered most of the ceiling, old pictures from them when they were younger Bobby had taken was there too. Mugs were locked inside glass shelves. A small fridge stood by the left side, a table some meters behind it.
Dean was out of the door before Castiel managed to summon himself awake. He rubbed the tiredness out of his eyes. On his side of the bed, a note laid. Dean's curved letters written on it, Castiel picked it up. His eyes scanned through the paper. Dean was meeting up with another musician for the duo-song he would make.
Castiel frowned. He stared again(he did that and made Dean uncomfortable but he was not one for commenting that every five minutes). "I heard you say on the phone, he acted suspiciously," Castiel stated.
Silence rested upon them both and Dean swallowed nervously. They exchanged a glance between each other as Dean wrapped his hand around the amulet. It began to glow in white color. The room became black as it moved into white again. Dean's scream disturbed the silence and he started to wrestle the bedsheet. His skin was burning up. Cas held him down, Dean's pupils close to black from the sheer force.
"There's a sign on the wall but she wants to be sure.'Cause you know sometimes words have two meanings. In a tree by the brook, there's a songbird who sings, sometimes all of our thoughts are misgiven." Dean closed his eyes and his fingers flew over the strings. A hint of pain entered Dean's voice.
Sam Winchester.
Sam straightened once he recognized Lucifer's arrival, a smile played on his lips. He walked out of the prison cell. The days never really existed in hell. Not that he cared for anything. "What does the fallen angel want today?" Sam asked. A glint showed in his eyes that weren't there before.
Father crunched in front of him. "I got a mission for you," he said.
After ten minutes and two seconds, Dean's hands found the leather jacket. The brown colors were faded and had dirt on the inside. Dean lifted his hand to a few centimeters over it, a white blaze shone from his palm. A moment later, the jacket was clean and he changed into it. Dean found a red plaid to take on and some jeans.
Castiel — the man Dean gotten a command to kill, walked out. He stared for a while, something boiled under his skin. Like an itch in his mind, that urged forward to break the walls in his head. He didn't, though. Raphael told him not to 'scratch the wall', so he followed that.
"What's stopping you?" He grabbed for straws. He knew that. Dean didn't notice how a few heads had turned towards them nor how his entire being was focusing on one person alone, Cas.
. Dean gestured to the way the Baby was. "You guys ready for the road trip?" Dean said.
They were the greenest eyes he had ever seen.
All the colors humans considered fun was there. Yellow, pink, green you name it, it was there. Dean followed them inside to the table where they asked for food. The two angels left their food untouched as normal. Although, Castiel ate a hamburger and groaned in pleasure.
Dean bit his underlip, already figured out what Raphael wanted from him. He took some distance between his feet. Dean's hand wielded the sword(it was light as a feather in his hand) ready to stab.
A small smile spread on his face. Sam's knuckles tightened around the wheel. Blackness and few yellow lights flashed up to his way to the next state over. He passed a few houses on the road before he parked the car in one of the Motels nearby the main city. Sam finally decided to answer Dean.
Dean sat in the driver seat and put in
"Cas?" His voice was distant to even his own ears.
he thought happily.
"You are ready for the party," Lucifer answered.
Castiel ripped his pants off. His breath hitched in his throat. Dean's lips caressed Castiel's neck once he was close enough. The smell was familiar. Of nature, an unmistakable odor of sweat that mingled into his musk he couldn't get enough. Castiel flinched but his fingers touched the walls to his entrance. Dean's hips bucked.
Sam tried before to hack into the police station's date base with no such luck. He heard rumors about a community that did take cases like this but they were hard to track down. It always started on hurricanes, strong winds. The death rate varied from state to state. For all he knew, this was his ticket to finding his demon. Sam collected his papers neatly on the desk.
"Isn't there any way you can get them back?" Sam asked. They both acted as Dean was non-existent. He convinced himself he only stayed for the information and nothing else.
"I am fine," Cas said assuringly. "Had a hard day." He tried to take the glass back but Dean held it out so Cas couldn't reach it. Dean's eyes narrowed. Worry spread in his chest, he knew the signs of someone being broken and Cas showed far too many for Dean's liking.
A little kid, around the age of nine, stared at him with big eyes. His brown hair was ruffled. The kid smiles brightly at him before he started to grin. Sam frowned in confusion. "Single bed," Sam said.
"You ever heard of private space?" Dean rolled his eyes and pushed up his sleeves. "Yes, it's inspired by a person but I got a hard time making the notes," he said. "The music isn't coming to me and I have a friend of mine having problems and I want to help him," Dean's become very interested at the desk.
was what he wanted to answer.
He was too tired to pay attention to his surroundings and who he was talking with. Finally, he sat down on a comfy chair and turned towards the interviewer.
Out of the corner of his eyes, he saw some men appear from thin air. All of them wore matching black expensive suits. But it was unmistakable who stood in the middle. Dean's light brown hair stood out from the rest. His freckles as familiar as when Castiel saw him for the first time when he bypassed a poster. Or his green eyes that seemed to wield the secret of life itself.
"Care to share, Dean?" Castiel found himself smiling. Dean had yet to turn. He saw the Billboard awards on the walls, from 2009 to 2012. Castiel knew Dean deserved every single one of those, he hadn't told Dean he was one of the very first fans. That was for another time, another day.
Then the first attack against the barricaded door happened. The door bulged inwards by the pressure. "Sammy, tell me what's going on, right now!" Dean yelled, his eyes kept drifting from him to the door.
"I talked with your producer, he wants you to create a more personal album. Camilla is waiting for us at
"Do you never become tired of speaking like this?" Dean commented. He put the glass down and fumbled with the glass.
. His eyes slide closed when he recalled what they had argued about. Of course, Dean had been so close to his personal space he didn't realize before Dean's little brother walked in on them. Castiel's hand curled around the keys. The darkness made it hard to see ahead. He tucked his trench coat closer to his chest. Inside his heart, his emotions fought for dominance.
He heard the familiar sound of Dean entering the house, Sam sat at his normal desk working on the next few months scheduled promotion campaign. Dean yelped out in surprise once he saw him, his apple green eyes widened in surprise. "Sammy?" Dean's shocked voice disturbed Sam's(for once) peaceful silence. "What are you doing working so late? Do you never take breaks?" His eyes landed on the documents on his desk.
Dean's heart ached when he sang the next lyrics. He thought's of Camilla's brown eyes, black hair that fell around her face as she was an Asian princess. How her face brought light to his dark days when she laughed. "The demon holds my soul but I was saved by my beauty queen, she is my beauty queen. We play with their hearts like a ribbon on their vessels. I broke the seal of the angels, o' lord praises me."
"Trust me, having those issues will break you down and make you feel like hell," Dean said firmly.
Dean opened the paper without asking for more. His eyes went from surprised to sad in a matter of minutes. He opened and closed his mouth a few times. Dean took off the amulet he always wore around his neck. "Sam..." he muttered to himself.
The angels wore the standard black suit, matching shoes, the woman with their hair in a knot, and the men utterly expressionless. Raphael, Michael, Gabriel, and other archangels stood behind God. Lucifer as well as Crowley were five meters from Cas. Their army was considerable. Sam whistled low. The twigs that broke stopped momentarily.
Ooh, ooh, and she's buying a stairway to heaven," Castiel sang softly to the empty coffin between the earth under his feet.
"No," Castiel said. His eyes narrowed in fury, the room rattled. Then it stopped. "Dean needs you, you are his brother."
Sam and Dean exchanged a glance. "Hey, don't leave here alone," Dean pleaded. The appeal to walk in there? That was like trying to make a Cupid doing his job without him shooting arrows at your ass. That was difficult. "Come on, man," Dean said insisting.
. He focused solely on Balthazar, his tunnel vision on him alone. Sam waited for what he would say. He tasted the rest of the salad in his mouth. Sam still felt Balthazar was keeping things from him but he was willing to risk it. No way he would go further into the hunter society without a backup plan.
As if the prison cell knew the visitors were gone, the flames flared up again on his body. Sam closed his eyes and attempted to stay in his happy memories. Anything to escape the pain that nagged him day in and day out.
He stood outside the bar waiting for Camila to arrive. Dean looked around impatiently. "Man, this is killing me. How long does a woman take to be ready?" Dean pouted.
Sam cleared his throat. "Lucifer doesn't have any problem giving me the lead for your army,
"Hey, we are always been enough to fix it," Sam reassured him. For once in his life, he relaxed and he held back his complicated emotions in his chest. The pain was not an unknown feeling, however, is scared he couldn't show his brother. He had to be strong, for his father's sake. Dean forced a grin on his face.
Of course, Dean fought against the itch to roll his eyes. "Yes, they plan to work together with the king of hell. We have to stop them—" Dean said as he turned to Michael.
The man's hazel eyes made a chill run down his back. He knew this person. Dean's grace was quick to see the knight demon face there was the Mark of Cain on the person's arm. Dean's hands twitched to reach for an angel blade he didn't have.
"Do it, kid! Is not like he can arrest you for it."
Sam thought.
"Our song is
"What?" Dean asked. He rolled his shoulders before he licked his lips, Castiel's eyes followed the movements as enchanted. "You love it," he grinned.
"Then what should we do? You obviously don't love me anymore," she leaned towards the white wall, the sun beginning to get through the curtains on the other end of the room. Her eyes locked into his own. He opened and closed his mouth a few times. "I get it."
"I-I don't know when he told me, he looked scared before I could do anything he stormed out. I ran after him but it was too late, the dude was already gone," Dean said. "I swear the guy can fly, he disappeared on the spot," Dean continued. He gestured with his hands and mouthed 'poff'.
The silence where the only response he got. So Sam stood up from the ground and turned towards Balthazar. The surprised face definitely created room for him to think out alternatives that Balthazar kept from him. "No—I mean, yes, she did. Why?" Balthazar finally said.
A few awkward moments later they had exchanged their numbers and Castiel managed to relax his shoulders. They talked for a bit later and Dean had to go for the other interview again. Once he saw Dean left the bar he turned to look at Dean's number on his phone.
They reached back to town later in the evening and Sam finally got to meet some hunters. One part of him worried the other was excited. However, he knew to expect anything from anyone the hunters weren't much approved by the rest of society.
When he walked into his room, he didn't expect to see Balthazar and Gabriel standing in his living room. Both stood with their hands crossed behind their backs, a serious face etched into their faces. "What the hell, man? You can't just break into a house like that," Dean said, he slammed the door shut harder than he intended. The lights bulbs shook above their heads for a moment.
Castiel hid the beer bottles since he saw how much of the drunk. It was his last straw. Dean saw no reason to keep on living with this inner pain. Slowly, he used the tip of his finger to take off the safety as his dad had shown him years before.
Castiel sighed before he moved his fingertips. Blood splattered some of the crowd's clothes and benches, floor. Castiel wiped away the crimson liquid from his face. His lips went downcast. The God images changed to Castiel's instead. He stretched his tie. Castiel found the screaming to be irritating and turned around to be faced with...
Oh okay. That was it. He flew away and landed on top of the headquarters to the angels.
Cas managed to get the two fingers right on his first try, he had a harder try to reach the thinnest one. Dean put the guitar against the wall. He once again let Cas have time to withdraw if he found it uncomfortable. Dean's fingers took a light hold on Cas's finger though he took his time to put it on the string. "Looks you will have to use a few days to get to this string, is normal. I wasn't a perfect player," Dean soothed Cas.
felt okay.
Castiel finally noticed who was sitting on a chair with a yellow colored guitar. It was Dean. His fingers played experienced on the guitar creating heavenly sounds and then the voice...
"What the hell, man? I think you need to talk to
He realized however how real the angels had been, they had no understanding of the connection he now wielded with Cas. At some point, 'Castiel' had become 'Cas', and Dean slowly discovered that in his eyes, Cas wasn't the Father in any sense of the word. He was, Cas. Dean glanced at the huge metal door when he recognized Cas's powers from the other side. The sound of the door unlocked itself made Dean straighten up.
"You aren't supposed to see this, Dean. I am trying to protect you," Sam moved over to the bag again, he took out iron strings that he fastened on the door. He threw the key to a random place on the floor. He rubbed his eyes. For the tenth time that day, Sam checked his watch. He had done everything he could and now the only thing left to do was to wait.
"Come on, it wasn't even that bad," Dean pouted. He took hold of Castiel's trenchcoat as he guided them out. Outside the grey sky was everywhere. The cold air made his air turn white as well as Dean's.
"There's a lady who's sure all that glitters is gold and she's buying a stairway to heaven. When she gets there she knows, if the stores are all closed with a word she can get what she came for." Dean sang softly to himself. His emotions hit close to Castiel's heart.
"Fine, you have it," the other said, his voice tired and angry before the person moved to say, "I am sorry," as a whisper.
"Security protocol, wouldn't want any murderers after what happened back in California. Problems always seem to follow you, Dean," said Balthazar. He shrugged before he gestured at Gabriel. "We heard the news and guessed you would head back here. If you think this is bad? You haven't seen what people talk about." Balthazar finished.
"So, how is the work going for ya?" Dean raised one eyebrow. He punched his shoulder playfully as he grinned. "Any hot chicks?"
The trees surrounded them, their branches waved quietly in the background. The ground was dirty by previous footsteps, no police were in sight. A woman dressed in a white dress laid on the ground, her platinum blonde hair tangled in the mud. Where her eyes were supposed to be, they were completely black. Sam crunched down to get a closer look.
Dean refused to let go, already going through a few ways to persuade him to tell. He cared even it was one of his many fans. Dean's eyes shifted back to Cas's again. A rush of adrenaline still went through his body. For a few seconds, they stood there locked in a staredown.
"If you were to play a love song to your girlfriend, which would it be?" Dean's eyes widened in surprise by Cas's question. He opened and closed his mouth a few times.
"No, I wouldn't risk destroying him. I don't have that good control over my powers yet. I could...kill him if he restrains against my powers."
His blood rushed in his ears. Castiel's heart throbbed roughly. Sweat spread on his forehead and Castiel struggled to get his thoughts right.
Stars in all colors began to appear behind his eyelids. A dull headache began to form. It throbbed hard against his skull. No matter how desperately he tried to get into his lungs he never got enough. Winds pressed towards the windows. He heard the sounds of glass breaking and bowed down to not get hit. His vehicle hit a tree. The impact forced his body backward in a brutal throw. Lungs went empty of air.
is dangerous and I have never encountered anything like it before."
Castiel took a sharp intake of breath. Before Castiel could move to get out of the car, Anna drove out on the way. Her hands clenched around the wheel, her lips pressed firmly together. "Why did you do that?" Castiel turned to Anna. His voice filled with anger and fear. He knew deep within his heart Dean was there.
Dean held his hands up in a sign of surrender while Bobby threw water on. Dean spits it out as he blinked in confusion. "Dude, I am alive, how many times do I have to tell you?" Dean said.
Pain exploded behind his eyelids. Dean's hand unwillingly opened up and the blade fell to the floor with a loud bang that echoed in the silent room. Damn it. He used his other hand to use grace to repeal Castiel's hold on him. Before Castiel opened his mouth to talk, his hands were around Castiel's throat. A tear drilled down his cheek. It was suddenly hard to breathe. Dean's heart squeezed in his chest.
"You should stay away," Anna's eyes narrowed at him.
After a few attacks more the door fell to the floor, the white dust rose from the surface. Sam held the demon knife, he saw their black fur, yellow eyes, and stank of the dead. Dean's eyes moved in the wrong places, as Sam already knew from before, solely he could see them. One of the hellhounds launched against his stomach and he cut the nose with the knife.
. Dean stared back at Sam, refusing to listen to the voice in his mind.
"Is just I am sorry about what I did, I never knew how much I hurt you," Dean rubbed his neck. Suddenly the bottled-up feelings made his gaze teary. Dean went out and in of focus.
Cas dragged Dean closer to himself. Sam felt awkward as if he witnessed something that was between his big brother and his friend. He cleared his throat and immediately both of them moved apart from each other as if been burned. "Camilla will find out, you can still make it up with her. But question is, whatever you chose there will be people out there angry, and will it be worth it?" Sam asked.
"Hello Dean, it would be rude if I don't introduce myself. I am Castiel Novak and this is my friend Anna Milton." Castiel said. They shook hands.
Crowley wore a black suit, his eyes narrowed however, he seemed bored out of his mind. Sam felt the same way about being stuck downstairs for ages. Crowley talked the demons out. Sam's fingers flickered over his demon knife Lucifer had given him during his birthday.
Raphael froze in his position before two angels Dean didn't recognize flew away. Dean had a clear idea of what was on his mind and waited to fire his questions until Raphael faced him. "Why did you lie about my brother?" Dean's hands clenched by his side as his eyes narrowed.
"Like hell is difficult, I am here because I want to," Dean said. Sam opened and closed his mouth. He knew something was off about his little brother but no way he could prove it without evidence. Bobby acted weird around him too, the way he always did when he kept things from him.
Haziel flipped through Dean's porn magazines a frown became deeper and deeper from every page he passed. He didn't turn when he started to talk. "My battalion is eliminating your tracks as we speak, when do you wish to see Castiel?"
Castiel tilted his head in confusion. Sam cleared his throat. "It has, when I was undercover for these two last months I managed to pick up some intel from the inside since you kept Crowley busy by killing off his knights. Raphael was the one to tip Dean's life into an archangel and they recreated his soul. There exist a layer dividing Dean's soul from his memories and hardened him to be able to handle the pressure of an archangel. He has wings, sure but that isn't what makes him an archangel. Are God's powers," Sam explained. Castiel's expression progresses in agreement, to surprise, then shock.
The day passed when drove to his destination, he heard someone slam a door closed and the footsteps of his big brother closing into him. "Sam, what's going on?" Dean asked, his voice worried. Sam decided not to answer and walked to the farmer's house. He felt Dean's hand on his shoulder however Sam wiped the hand away quick enough.
"What?" Castiel squeaked. A wave of tiredness sweats him under. Sweat spread in his veins. Castiel groaned at the pain that was inflicted on him. It destroyed his senses. "What do you mean?" His tune was groggy to his own ears.
"I can't, I am sorry."
Sam took a deep breath. Dean made relaxing circles on his back although his eyes saw worry for him. "I am fine," Sam said as he leaned into Dean's shoulder. His tensed back relaxing.
Sam rubbed his face with his palm and leaned back on the chair." I got nothing," he said simply. Sam didn't hear the answer from Bobby straight away he turned towards the clock on the wall.
Anna showed no sign of surprise on her face, nor did Castiel expect any. She clearly would be irritated about what he did. But in his case, it was for Dean. Nothing could compare to Dean's freckles, his strong body that wrapped himself around him more than once when Sam was away. Or he talks about soccer games. It never stopped to amaze him back then, how true Dean could be to himself.
He took the familiar route to the living room. The desk was full of books open on different pages with drawn pictures in it. Dean noticed one of them was open with the title
Suddenly the piano started again, more forceful and strong. He felt proud of his fans, they knew him so well. He arose from the chair and moved to the forefront of the stage. Dean touched a few hands of his fans. Many of them began to cry and others fainted. The guards on the side took care of that immediately.
