“Strange name, Cas.”
Dean isn’t sure what to do with his hands.
Castiel laughs and then
Castiel’s still facing the bookshelf and waits a few seconds to turn around and look at Dean. He needs to approach him carefully about this.
“You never get dessert. Why is that?” Dean asks.
And with that, Dean closes the distance between them, and they kiss in front of their friends and family. As husbands.
“Castiel has been crying in our room for over an hour. I tried to help, but he won’t tell me anything except that his lunch with his father was horrible and that his father turned his phone off. I came to you because I don’t have Meg’s number but either way, Meg is close with her family and wouldn’t be able to relate as well to this situation as you could. Before you ask, no, Castiel didn’t tell me any of your family details. He merely mentioned that there was a funeral over Spring Break and that you and your father had a complicated relationship; I put some pieces together, connected some dots or so have you. Any-who, Castiel does not want to talk to me. In fact, he specifically told me to leave him alone, so I am here to sic you on him instead. I’m leaving him alone and you’ll be there to make sure he doesn’t dehydrate from crying.” Crowley says. “Also, Castiel did not tell me where you live, you are simply easy to find. Now, please go see if he will allow you to help him. I will spend the rest of the day in the library.”
Dean doesn’t know what to say. He just opens the door wider to let Cas in. He wants to hug Cas, but he decides to keep his hands to himself.
“You got it.” Charlie says.
It takes a long time. Castiel internally debates whether or not he should go after Dean and decides against it. Dean will come back when he is ready. Until then, Castiel will wait.
Cas: Hello, Dean.
Castiel’s heart melts and he kisses Dean’s cheek. “And you are exactly what
“No. I’m not mad.”
. And talking to someone he doesn’t even believe in is better than talking to no one.
“’Course you can.” Dean opens his arms out to Cas.
But that’s against their rules.
Castiel nods and immediately regrets it.
“Which Singer? Bobby or Ellen?”
Is a man who is supposedly holy still holy when he hurts his children?
“Dean?” Cas asks. “Are you okay?”
“I was joking, Cas. I want to go with you.” Dean can’t help but feel weirdly touched by Cas’s concern. It must be strange for Cas to be his friend. Cas is this super powerful angel and Dean is just a puny little human. And right now, Dean’s being told that he needs to let some other super powerful angel take him over and do whatever the Hell he wants. So, Cas is…Cas is being careful—considerate.
“Yeah,”
you?” Dean lets out a laughing sob.
Can he be that for Cas?
Castiel doesn’t even think. He reaches out and grabs Dean’s wrist. “Don’t leave,” he whispers. “Please, Dean, don’t leave.”
“Tickle fight over?”
Cas takes Dean’s right hand in his and kisses his knuckles. Dean feels something stir inside him and tears prick his eyes.
“Cas?” Dean calls, running into the kitchen. “What happened?”
, they’re at a point where they tell each other that.
“Looks like we’ll be waking up beside each other forever.” Dean chuckles, feeling his face flush. It’s hard to go from years of not saying what he felt to suddenly saying it all the time. He likes it but it’s…different.
. Jack saw the train and thought it looked cool. Dean likes the movie. The song about hot chocolate is catchy. Of course, Dean feels so good right now that he thinks he would like any movie they watched.
How’s Dean supposed to explain that he misses Cas already even though he hasn’t left yet? Just telling the guy that Dean believes him now will send him away forever…assuming he
You don’t know.
Castiel enjoyed both movies, but he was anxious to give Dean his first new and improved gift.
“How did you find that?” Dean whispers. He glances at the door, suddenly worried his dad will show up.
Dean smiles tightly and puts his hand on Castiel’s arm. He looks into Castiel’s eyes and seems to be searching for words. Dean says nothing and releases Castiel’s arm. It feels incredibly cold without Dean’s gentle touch.
Dean sees a kid sitting alone on a swing, reading a book, so he decides to sit on the other swing.
Dean and Cas run upstairs to change clothes. It’s time for dancing. It’s really not much of a change. They just throw their jackets in their room and take off their matching vests so they’re both in their white dress-shirts and black slacks. They also change shoes. Cas puts on his old bumblebee Converse. Dean puts on his old biker boots. The shoes are their something old. Their rings are their something new. Dean’s borrowing a pair of Cas’s bumblebee socks and Cas is borrowing a pair of Dean’s coffee mug socks.
“Yes.” Dean tries not to whine.
Cas: Favorite color?
Dean doesn’t believe Cas. Obviously. But there’s something about this guy. Because, God help him, but Dean
“Dean! Wake up!”
“Do you want to watch
. He has been curious about the book for a while, but he hasn’t read it yet. There are quite a few lines that intrigue him. One is “The mind is its own place, and in itself/Can make a Heaven of Hell, a Hell of Heaven” (Milton, 254-255). Castiel likes this line the most so far. Because it’s true. Because sometimes Castiel gets so wrapped up in his own mind that he feels like his brain is on fire. Because sometimes, he has found paradise in the places he hates and fears the most.
“Like what?”
“For what?” Castiel asks.
“That’s one word for him. I’m partial to shithead.” Castiel shrugs.
Well…perhaps not
“Okay. If you’re not the kid’s dad, who is?”
hates me. I’ll never—I’ll never—I’ll never be—be,” Cas gasps for breath.
Cas starts mumbling, “Dean, you makin’ coffee?”
Dean: Favorite beverage?
Claire and the rest of her team run to the middle to set up for the next play.
. He also notices that there’s a bruise on Claire’s face and his insides turn to dust.
“Dean!” Castiel shouts.
Cas whirls around and his face turns the same shade of red as a ripe cherry tomato. “Dean?” Cas’s voice cracks. “
“It’s the small one to the right.” Dean gestures to the general area of the gas pedal.
Dean’s eyes widen and his face feels hot. He does not want to flirt with this guy
“Yeah?” Dean asks.
“No, I do not.” Claire says without looking up from her book.
Castiel walks into the bathroom feeling physically better, but emotionally conflicted. Dean is clearly growing attached to Castiel and if that’s the case, he may believe Castiel about who he claims to be. And when Dean believes Castiel, Castiel will return to 2021, effectively leaving Dean until Dean meets Castiel in 2008. He worries that this may contribute to Dean’s abandonment issues. Castiel doesn’t want to be another person who leaves Dean…technically, he
, and Dean and Charlie are eating dinner together before Dean’s shift at the library.
Dean blinks and then shrugs. “Okay, Cas. I gotta use the bathroom first though. Be right back.”
Cas hugs Dean back. “It’s okay, Dean.” Cas says.
When will Dean stop crying over him?
He grabs everything he needs and shoves it into his thrift-store leather jacket. Then he walks out of his dorm on his way to Wawa. An occasional cup of Wawa coffee won’t hurt his budget too much. He really loves those mochas with the extra caffeine.
“Thanks, Meg.” Cas giggles and Dean’s heart just about flies out of his chest because it is the cutest sound he has ever heard.
Being human is getting tattoos to prevent possession and supernatural tracking but also to represent people he loves: a small cowboy hat for Dean, a book for Sam, a teddy bear for Jack, a lioness for Eileen, and a halo for the angel Castiel once was. Castiel also has tattoos of things he has read. He’s partial to the Richard Siken quote, “Here is the part where everyone was happy all the time and we were all forgiven, even though we didn’t deserve it.” Castiel has that going up his right arm. The one he used to wield his angel blade with. Because that’s how right now feels. They’re not happy
“Yeah, it does.” Benny says. He puts his arm around Garth’s shoulders. “But it’s worth it.”
Dean feels eyes on him, and he looks to see the douchebag staring. “She’s my kid.” Dean practically growls.
“Me too,” Dean whispers. “Maybe,”
this.
What the hell?
Cas laughs wetly.
Dean can’t help but laugh a little.
Dean can hear Cas gasp through the thin walls. Dean holds his breath for a full minute before Cas opens the door and falls into his arms, sobbing. Dean catches Cas and gently closes the door with his foot. He leads Cas to the bed, and they sit for a while, but they end up lying on the bed together. Dean has his arms wrapped around Cas with Cas’s head tucked protectively under his chin and Cas has a firm grip on Dean’s shirt like he’s afraid Dean will disappear.
does.
Dean can’t stop bouncing. He just can’t. And he’s sweating. It’s so fucking hot in here. He hates it. He’s not sure what to do about it either because he thinks he should take off his suit jacket because it’s so hot and he’s probably going to start smelling soon. But, if he does that, won’t everyone think he’s rude for not wearing the jacket?
“I think my dad may have been like your dad.” Dean admits. “I had to escape just to get here.”
Dean takes a deep breath. Then another. Then another. He blinks. The world feels…better than it did two minutes ago. Dean pulls away from Cas and stands.
Dean leans his face against Castiel’s shoulder. His heart is pounding, and he feels like he can’t breathe, but he has to tell him.
“No, it won’t.”
Dean blinks and clears his throat, pulling away from Cas. “Thanks Cas.” Dean says.
Castiel shakes his head. As much as he loves his older brother, he can’t deal with this right now.
the cat ones! Thank you!” Meg yells.
Dean can hear her laughing from outside. His face heats up and he puts the palm of his head on his face…as if that’s going to help.
“Nothing. I,” Cas shakes his head. “Fuck him.”
“So, how’s everything?” Bobby asks.
Dean winces at the admission. He can’t help it. He can just hear his dad yelling at him for his weakness. If there’s one thing John Winchester doesn’t approve of, it’s weakness. At least…that’s how he used to be. Maybe he changed. Dean sure as hell doesn’t know. He hasn’t seen the man since he snuck out of the house to come to orientation here freshman year.
“How are you not angry?” Cas glares at Dean.
“That makes sense,” Cas mumbles.
“Yeah?” Cas asks.
Dean shrugs and grins like a mischievous kid. “You’re cute when you’re confused. Would you prefer me to stop? I don’t mind stopping.”
Instead of tossing and turning while those
Castiel chuckles and presses his face into Dean’s chest. Dean holds Castiel just a little tighter. Castiel breathes Dean in. He smells differently than he used to. Dean used to smell like whiskey and gunpowder and blood and sweat. Now he smells like mint from his toothpaste and cinnamon from his deodorant and soap from the shower he took thirty minutes ago and a little sweat. Castiel’s beginning to realize that perhaps Dean gets nervous around Castiel just like Castiel gets nervous around Dean. Sweat is by far one of the worst parts about being human. But maybe it’s not so bad if Dean sweats too. It’s like in that song about melting with someone else that Dean has been playing lately. What is it again? “I Melt with You” by Modern English?
It’s technically Tuesday, April 20
“Even though I can’t pop popcorn? And I need to replace our microwave?”
“I’ll tell them. They won’t be mad at you.”
Cas gets his card out, swipes, and the doors open.
Dean doesn’t say anything for a few beats. Then he asks, “Charlie told you; huh?”
me. So, thanks for that.”
Castiel cries out as a sharp pain flashes all over his cheek and his side where he landed when he fell.
One more chapter after this!!:)
He’s not sure that Dean feels the same way. It has been a week since Jack rescued Castiel from The Empty and Dean has not mentioned Castiel’s confession. Castiel cannot be sure if that means that Dean does not reciprocate his feelings or if that means that Dean is scared to talk about the subject. Frankly, both options seem characteristic of Dean, so it is truly impossible to tell.
“Yeah! Good job Claire!” Dean yells.
This is by far the most wonderous blanket Castiel has ever seen. It is incredibly soft as well. Castiel wraps himself in the blanket.
Dean: I hate you so much right now.
Castiel shakes his head and swipes at his eyes.
It’s about crying for a long time and then jumping when a hand touches his shoulder.
“Hiya, Cas.” Dean grins back at Cas.
“Can you…can you sleep next to me?” Cas asks in a quiet voice.
Maybe.
“I love you. So much, Cas.” Dean replies, gently brushing the hair out of Cas’s face.
Castiel also sends a pumpkin emoji.
Cas likes him.
“What?” Dean asks. He can’t help but smile. There’s just something so soft in Cas’s expression.
“Aw, shit.” Dean mutters as soon as they walk through their front door.
“Thanks,” Castiel smiles at Dean.
I can’t stop. I’m so fucking sorry, Cas. For everything.
They all fall asleep on Dean’s floor huddled together in front of Dean’s laptop. Benny’s out before
“Dean, this is your choice. Not mine.”
“Have you talked about when you’re getting married?”
“You’re not just a weapon. You’re my best friend and I,” Dean tries to say it, but he just can’t get the words out. Why is this so hard to say? This
Dean smiles at Castiel. His eyes are glassy, but he’s got a wide smile on his face. “I’ve got something for you too.” He reaches into his back pocket and pulls out a bee keychain with a key on it. He hands it to Castiel saying, “So you can always come back home.”
No, that’s not fair.
Cas laughs and wraps his arms around Dean. Dean puts his mug down beside him and hugs Cas back.
Sammy looks from Cas to Dean to Cas and says, “Your meeting was a meet-ugly.”
Dean walks straight for the Impala.
“So, Dean of 2021 actually picks his battles?”
“That’s much appreciated.” Castiel replies.
“Cas!” Jack slides on his knees beside Castiel.
But he knows that he wants to retire. He wants to use his hands to make things. He doesn’t want to kill anymore. He’s done.
Castiel’s eyes burn with tears. Castiel smiles at the blurry image of his almost-husband. This man. This man who loves Castiel just as much as Castiel loves him…and Castiel loves him a lot.
When they arrive at Dean’s and Castiel’s apartment, Gabriel is holding his phone up, clearly recording everyone walk in while Meg and Crowley are mid-argument because Crowley refuses to take down the banner that hangs across the living room. But that’s okay, because when Dean sees the banner, he breaks into a huge grin.
“I would’ve gotten Jack to tear through the past with me to find you, but Naomi was gonna kill you if I tipped them off. And even if she didn’t kill you, you would’ve been human. And…and I didn’t wanna make you lose such an important part of yourself. Not again. Not after the last time. And not ‘cuz your angel powers are useful. But ‘cuz you’ve been, you know,
really what
“I, uh,” Dean doesn’t know what to say.
happy. Are you happy, Jack? You deserve to be happy too, you know.”
“Okay, let’s try to relax a bit. You need to be loose, so you’ll be ready to make turns.”
“Dean?” Rowena asks.
“Cas, you are so not an asshole.” Charlie says.
Cas chuckles and bumps Dean’s shoulder.
. But he’s
Dean feels like every place where Cas touches him is on fire. He looks at Cas and realizes he has never been this close to him before…at least, not in the daylight. He looks into those blue, blue eyes of Cas’s and tries to come up with a comparison for them. What else has he seen that is this shade of blue? Those eyes put the sky and the ocean to shame.
Castiel shrugs. “Worth it,” He smiles and waves, “Bye, Dean.”
the rooms in Tucker are hot, but it hadn’t gotten to the point where it was nearly unbearable until Castiel smiled at Dean. Shit. Fuck. Fuck. Fuck.
Dean-Yeah? Mine too. Apparently, Charlie and Benny had a bet.
Then the panic sets in.
“Hey, Cas.” Dean replies. “Oh hey, we need to figure out the division of labor.”
“I know.” Castiel gives Dean’s shoulder a little pat.
“What kind of a self-respecting junior has a class on Friday?” Dean gently pokes Cas’s side.
“I can’t wait to go off together.” Dean says. “Not too far from Sammy, but a little wiggle room…just for us.”
“That is what you would call bullshit, Dean.”
“Yes. Thank you.” Castiel passes the mug to Dean.
. Castiel shouldn’t do this to Dean. Castiel doesn’t even understand what he’s doing or what’s going on with his head. Everything is just so
“What the fuck is Benny doing there?” Dean laughs.
Cas types into his phone and Dean receives several texts.
Dean has to blink back tears before he can look at Cas again. Then he starts talking.
This is the place Cas found to be
“Fine,” the doctor sighs and ushers Castiel out of the room and into the waiting room. “Where’s your friend?” The doctor asks in a stern voice as if the problem is Castiel rather than the ridiculous no-friends-allowed policy.
“I had Jack’s help.” Dean grins. “We bought a printer when we were at the mall that time and for the past few days, I’ve had him distract you so I could run to his room to print stuff out.”
an amateur when it comes to this, but still. He should’ve planned better.
who had the worst fright.
Dean runs a hand through Cas’s hair. “It’s gonna be okay, Cas. I promise.”
“You’re not the Dean of 2021 and the two of you differ in many ways, but you still mean a lot to me. I need you to know that just because I want to go home, does not mean I don’t care about you. I just…I

Dean can feel Cas pulling him to his feet. There are people staring. Dean’s laughing loudly.
Dean-Night, Cas
weeks doing what Castiel can only describe as panic-cleaning. Dean has started doing all of the chores and sometimes goes behind Castiel and redoes the chores he does, he has planned several meals and alternative meals for the whole week, he rearranged the pantry three times, rearranged the spices four times: in order of use, alphabetically, in order of expiration date, and then he put it back to being in order of use because he found that organization to be more efficient…in order of use
“How did you want to listen to music?” Dean asks.
“I don’t know, but at least you got to have the outdoor ceremony yesterday. That was the big one.”
Sam hugs Castiel. “Thank you for being there for him.” Sam says in a quiet voice.
Dean wishes Sam were here. It’s not like Sammy would know what to do in this situation either, but at least Dean wouldn’t have to deal with all this weird shit by himself. He
Cas reaches out and brushes away Dean’s tears with his thumb. His movements are so gentle. Dean’s not sure what he expected. It’s just that Cas is a literal angelic warrior of Heaven. And Dean’s just a human. And yet, here Cas is, wiping away Dean’s tears. Dean can’t remember the last time someone did that for him. It’s…nice to be taken care of.

but it’s just this weird dream he had where some dude said he loved him and was from the future or some shit. Dean can’t even remember his face though. He sighs. He needs to stop drinking so much.
Dean’s heart speeds up and he can’t help but grin. He has a home. “Welcome home, Cas. I would kiss you, but I don’t want to make Charlie fall on her face.”
Castiel takes a deep breath. He can see his breath. It’s so fucking cold out here.
They go back to the motel so Cas can take his pain meds.
Patricia smiles back and walks away.
Castiel follows Dean.
“I’m in a taxi. I’ll be there in about an hour, I guess.” Sammy says.
Dean wraps his arms around Cas and asks, “Can you hear my thoughts?”
Cas leaves.
“I’m useless!” Castiel sobs. “I cry all the time,” he gestures to the tears streaming down his face, “I have no powers. We haven’t gone on any hunts and I think it’s because you think I’m a risk. I don’t know how to clean up properly around here. I have tripped and fallen on my face three times just this week. I’ve never worn a bandage this often before but now I’m covered in them! I ache! I burn! I freeze! I’m in pain
Dean can make a good cheeseburger. He rented a motel with a kitchen a couple months ago and he made himself some burgers. He did that for a week before his dad checked in and gave him orders to go on a new hunt. Dean hated leaving that motel. He’d actually gotten pretty good at cooking burgers. If Cas really
Dean-I hear you. I ate almost nothing but soup all freshman year because I lived next to Campus Center and had a constant supply.
Castiel helps Dean into his old jean jacket from college with the bumblebee pin. This is the jacket Castiel was wearing when he bumped into Dean all those years ago. He’s a little surprised it still fits. Castiel would’ve figured after ten years he would be a different size but apparently not.
They spend some more time talking. They’re not talking about anything important really. They’re just sitting side-by-side on Cas’s bed, leaning against the wall. Eventually, Cas nods off and his head falls onto Dean’s shoulder.
Dean looks at their hands and he feels…he doesn’t even know. Hope? Yeah, that’s the word. When he looks at their hands, he thinks maybe…he
Dean feels a gentle hand on his shoulder, and he turns to see Cas standing near him. Cas opens his arms. Dean doesn’t think, he just collapses into Cas, clinging to him. Cas hugs him. Tightly. It’s what Cas always does when Dean’s afraid. Somehow, being held like this makes everything at least the tiniest bit less scary because at least Cas is here.
go get him? The window’s open and you could see him out on the street from here!”
At around 8pm, they go on a Wawa run and pay for overpriced candy and popcorn. Benny and Charlie refuse to let Dean help pay for any of it claiming it’s a birthday rule. They also all get huge ICEEs and mix up all the flavors.
“Do you really believe that?”
“What will you do?”
, Cas. And I don’t think you’re a burden because you’re having trouble being human. You’re not a burden. And we’ll figure this human stuff out together. I’ll take you in any form. Angel. Human. Whatever. I don’t care. I’ll give up hunting. I’m tired of fighting for my life and being afraid all the damn time anyway. I want to
“I asked you a question first. How did you get here?” Dean asks.
“No!” Castiel yells. He feels a rush of adrenaline and he punches The Empty in the face.
Then he takes the tablet and disappears.
Now, Dean’s here with these four people he loves more than anything else in the world and he wonders how he was lucky enough for this to happen. For them to all live to see another Christmas. This family also had a hellish start. He really didn’t think they would make it.
“What?” Dean asks with a small smile on his face.
Then they turn off the lights and lie together in bed.
There’s something intimate about waking up on a twin-sized mattress with the person you love. Because you can’t move without waking them. The bed is too small, and you’re caught in a tangle of blankets and legs and arms, so you have no choice but to lie there, listening to them breathe.
Dean grabs the fire extinguisher out of the cabinet below the sink and stands in front of Castiel. “Watch out, Cas.” Dean aims the fire extinguisher and some kind of white foam sprays out of the can.
Dean-Yeah, imagine my face when I tell Benny we told each other that we liked each other.
“You are upset. Why are you upset?”
Castiel-Thank you for the picture. That is an adorable bumblebee. I love you too. Have fun at work.
Cas stomps over to the porta-johns. He kicks the one closest to him.
Cas: I like weeping willows. They look sad. What about you?
Dean knows he should, but he doesn’t want to. What if he wakes up and Cas isn’t there? What if none of this was real?
Dean freezes as his heart fills up with adoration to the point of bursting.
, Dean won’t let Castiel do everything. How could Castiel even suggest that? He knows how Dean is about money.
It’s just…Dean won’t see Cas for a while after tomorrow because Cas is going home at 5pm sharp and he won’t be back until 5pm the following Friday. Dean has a love-hate relationship with Spring Break. All his friends leave campus which sucks because Dean’s one of the only people in his dorm every time. Charlie always checks in once a day, but it’s not the same as seeing her in person and Dean really doesn’t like feeling pitied anyway. He knows that rationally, Charlie doesn’t pity him, but Spring Break is not the time when Dean’s using the rational part of his brain.
Castiel smiles. It’s nice to see Dean laugh, even if this Dean isn’t
“Wait. You mean like, Satan?”
.” Dean gasps for breath. “Why didn’t he love me?”
Then his phone rings.
Dean loves having a chance to be someone he is not.
marathon. Everyone sets up for it. Castiel makes coffee. Sam gets out the candy and pours the contents of the various bags into assorted bowls. Charlie grabs the pints of Ben & Jerry’s ice cream she brought and a spoon for everyone. Charlie brought everyone’s favorites: Cold-Brew for Dean, Strawberry Cheesecake for Charlie, Sweet Like Sugar for Sam, and Everything But The… for Castiel. He’s still confused about what the … is supposed to represent, but he appreciates the chaos of this particular ice cream flavor. Dean pops the popcorn with the microwave Castiel bought three days ago.
Dean turns the light on in the car and turns to Cas who looks at him and tilts his head to the side. “What?” Cas asks.
Dean hugs Cas and feels Cas immediately wrap his arms around him.
It’s Saturday, March 27
“I don’t know what to believe,” Dean says, “but I
It’s kind of fun though.
Although…sometimes…when he’s alone, Dean can’t help but think that they would’ve been better off without their dad. Then Dean feels guilty for even
“Yeah? Me too.” Dean replies.
“Dean,” Cas sounds far away.
Dean adds the kissing face emoji after he sends the first text.
And Ellen hugs Dean tightly.
Castiel puts his free hand over Dean’s and gives it a gentle squeeze. The pressure helped him in some way before.
Dean is right next to Castiel. There is room on the couch, but Dean is sitting so close to Castiel that their thighs are touching. Castiel doesn’t say anything because it doesn’t bother him. He’s just not sure why Dean’s doing it. Dean has been sitting close to Castiel a lot lately. Castiel’s not sure how to ask Dean why he’s doing these things. Castiel fears that if he asks Dean about his reasons for doing these things, Dean may stop doing them.
I don’t hate you. I was asleep. I have to work now, but I’ll call you later.
, Dean suggests coffee. The very liquid Castiel runs on.
“I’m glad I am too. You’re a good kid.” Dean replies. “I think we should have a talk though. Can we?”
Castiel’s not sure how long he stays in the bathroom, but he feels exhausted and his head aches by the time he has calmed down. His face is covered in tears, snot is leaking onto his chin, and his throat hurts. Castiel gets up and does his best to clean himself up with toilet paper and a towel, but he can’t hide the blotchiness in his cheeks and the way his eyes are bloodshot and red-rimmed. He stares into the mirror for a few moments before letting out a sigh. He tried.
Then “Simple Song” by The Shins comes on and it feels like time stops. Dean really puts his heart into singing this song and holy
.” Dean admits.
“So, aside from that nap you took in the car, you’re pushing twenty-four hours without sleep?”
“Sorry, hi. I’m Dean.” Dean winces. “Like my mom said already. I don’t know where my brain went just now. Can we re-do this?”
“Club Can’t Handle Me” -Flo Rida and David Guetta
Charlie sits in the chair on the left side of the room. Sam sits on the chair on the right side of the room. The coffee table is lined with snacks. Castiel finds himself on the couch with Dean lying mostly in his lap. Castiel’s running his fingers through Dean’s hair and glancing from the movie to Charlie’s and Sam’s faces. He feels warm and so blessed to be here. He never really thought he would get to have this: someone to love, a room full of people who are willing to spend time with him, and a safe home to call his own. And he’s ever so grateful for Dean. Dean, who doesn’t yell or punch walls when Castiel makes mistakes. Dean, who tells Castiel he loves him and shows him that he does every day. Dean, who brings Castiel coffee in the morning and sometimes accompanies him on his runs. Dean, who is more of a sprinter than a long-distance runner. Dean, who steals Castiel’s clothes in the most adorable way possible: by washing them and “accidently” putting them in his drawer instead of Castiel’s. Dean, who knows that Castiel is never giving back that blue and green flannel. Dean, who doesn’t seem to mind that Castiel has an affinity for bees and even went out of his way to buy bee items for the apartment…for their home. Dean, who makes Castiel feel safe.
“You’re telling me you haven’t learned your lesson?” Zachariah asks. There’s venom in his voice and it makes the hair on the back of Dean’s neck stand up.
That seems like the less awful option. And is that not what life is about? Choosing the option that is the least shitty?
“I’m needed elsewhere,” Castiel says.
“Cas, I—I like you.” Dean’s voice shakes and he feels like he might throw up, but he presses on. “I think I have for a while. I just, I

Why the hell does the name Naomi sound familiar?

“Yeah, we’re gonna have so much cute bee stuff.”
“My friends are your friends now too, Dean. It’s nice that everyone gets along.”
“You’re gonna get through this, Dean.” Castiel says.
Cas rolls his eyes. “I’m cranky when I’m approximately twenty years in the past and I’ve got staples in my head.”
“Okay, you have my permission.”
“Let’s do it.” Dean grins.
“Yeah?” Dean asks. “I just have to ask shit?”
“My Best Friend” – Queen
“Can I touch you?” Dean whispers.
Dean had asked. That had been years ago, but Dean remembered.
It feels almost too personal to Dean for Castiel to analyze. He just…he wishes he could help more.
Dean wishes Cas would look at him so he could show him with his facial expression that he’s not lying. Cas always knows when Dean’s lying. Always.
“I’ve got an idea,” Dean says.
Dean kisses Cas. Dean’s hands drift up to Cas’s face and then his hair.
“No. You did not crush my arm.” Castiel says. He uses a half-asleep finger to poke Dean’s shoulder.
When they get into the motel, Dean says, “Your bed smells like ass, do you want to share mine?”
“What?” Cas asks, turning around to face Dean.
“I’ll help,” Castiel says.
“Jack brought me back. Remember? It was three days ago. I’m here now. I won’t leave you unless you ask me to.”
.” Dean rubs his eyes.
Cas’s cheeks turn red and he says, “If you say so, Dean.”
“Wow, you are such a dweeb.” Dean looks away from Castiel, but Castiel still sees Dean’s smile.
Castiel is not okay. Being told he is family and that he is loved and that the bunker is his home was a needed bandage on his wounded heart, but it does nothing to help with the nightmares and his deep-seeded insecurities which were the main problem anyway.
and Joey Batey singing as the character, Jaskier, “I am weak my love and I am wanting.” That is Dean right now. Dean is weak. Dean is wanting.
Dean cries for a long time. When he lifts his head up, he just stares at Castiel with those big green eyes of his.
Dean turns off the light and crawls into bed next to Cas. It’s not the biggest bed in the world, so their sides are touching. Cas freezes the first time this happens.
“I’m in a reading mood.”
“Yes, I do. With you and Sam and…some other people.”
I knew there was something I forgot.”
Dean sits on the edge of the bed, not facing Cas.
They take
“Yes, let’s not do that to Charlie. It would be cruel.” Cas replies. His smile is just so soft.
Castiel is not sure why Dean boops him on the nose. He cocks his head to the side, trying to figure out what the purpose of the boop is, but he can’t help but smile at Dean’s silly gesture.
“Angels ask permission to enter vessels. Although, technically, this is not my original vessel.”
Dean signs.
“Is this microphone live?” Dean whispers in Castiel’s ear.
Cas: Favorite holiday?
, it’s the pie.
But…Dean looks happy right now and maybe living in the moment is what is needed after everything they have been through.
Cas hugs Dean tighter. “It’s not your fault, Dean. This is my choice. Don’t take on burdens that are not yours to bear.”
Cas: I’d prefer sooner because I am eager to see you.
Castiel has another message. This one is from Gabriel.
“Yeah, well, Adam and Bela decided that they needed to be naked in this supposedly sacred place.” Benny chuckles.
“I think he’s going to like your choices.” Sam tells him.
They walk into the motel room and Dean heads for the bed in the front of the room. He walks back to Castiel and hands him a t-shirt and a pair of pajama bottoms with cheeseburgers on them.
Dean grins and says, “Yeah, exactly.”
Dean finds a Top 40 hits station. Castiel doesn’t like any of these songs. He sighs in frustration.
“I will.” Castiel promises. “You’ll feel it with me. It will take years for both of us to admit it to the other and there will be a lot of heartache, but it
“I wish the words came easier. We don’t have all day. We’re supposed to meet our friends at 11:14AM…which is a weirdly specific time.”
“I’m an angel, I’m not sure if I get colds.”
stop moving. People keep giving him dirty looks too. He’s started to cause a scene.
Cas walks into the room. “Hello Dean,” Cas smiles. He’s holding something behind his back. “I have a gift for you.”
by Mary Shelley.
Dean plays his next song and Castiel takes in a breath. He would recognize this song anywhere. It’s “Not Yet/Love Run (Reprise)” by The Amazing Devil.
“Good choice.”
“We can do this,” Castiel says.
“Yellow.” Gabriel always answers the phone like this. The familiar gesture tugs at Castiel’s heart. How long has it been since he last saw his older brother? Christmas. It feels like so much longer than two and a half months. And now Castiel is calling Gabriel just because he needs money. Castiel feels like he’s drowning in his shame, but he has to do this. He doesn’t have another choice.
It’s worth a shot, so he starts reading
“I’m fine. I used the popcorn setting.” Castiel replies.
Jack hands Castiel one of the three molds he’s using to form the sandcastles.
Dean looks back at Cas to see him tenderly wrap the headphone-wire around Dean’s Walkman. Dean tries to ignore the ache in his chest.
It’s March 17
(2015)
“I want coffee.” Castiel replies.
“No. It’s really not.” Castiel says. “You have cooked things before. You will cook things again and if this meal does not turn out right, that is okay. You are learning. Failure is part of the learning process. Do you understand?”
Neither says anything for a few moments.
Dean adjusts his tie. At least he tries to. His hands shake and he can’t quite get it.
“Do you have a cookie flavor in mind, or do you want to decide together later?” Dean asks.
“Okay everyone! This is our warm-up song, and remember, we need to pace ourselves if we want to get through this class. Please repeat my movements, but don’t worry if you mess up. We wouldn’t have called this class “Dancing Badly” if we actually took ourselves seriously.” Castiel says.
“You okay?” Dean asks.
“Do you want to put the angel on the tree?” Cas asks, holding the angel out to Dean.
“Okay, sure, setting a microwave on fire is a way to fuck up, but I don’t care that you fucked up, Cas. People make mistakes.
“Aw, shit.” Dean puts his hamper on the floor, steps over it, and offers Castiel his hand. “We really need to stop meeting like this.”
Cas sits up and latches onto Dean’s arm. “Don’t wanna. Wanna sleep now.”
“You’re just such a dork.” Dean shakes his head.
Dean’s smile falters. Cas probably didn’t like the years of heartache that Dean gave him. Years of pushing away. Years of pain and deceit.
“Let’s go for a walk.” Dean suggests.
“Do I still like you when you’re being bitchy?”
When the chorus plays, Dean whispers the words to Cas.
Castiel is excited for this one. He grabs Dean’s hand and leads him to his room. Dean drops by his room on the way and picks something up. He hides it in the pocket of his jeans. When they get to Castiel’s room, Castiel goes into his closet and pulls out today’s gift. He wrapped this one especially nicely. He hands it to Dean who smiles that same awkward smile he smiles every time he gets a gift. It’s almost like he’s worried that if he gets too excited, it’ll get taken away. Castiel would like a word with John Winchester…just to you know
Castiel sighs. He wants to write something to Dean, but instead he keeps writing a poem about why describing the one he loves is so difficult. He’s just throwing up line after line of a writer’s cry for help and understanding—of the infinite possibilities of the writing process—and how those possibilities are simultaneously freeing and a horrible cage to be stuck in due to the dreaded thought: what if the reader hates it?
Dean looks at Ellen and swipes at his eyes with his sleeve. “Sorry,” Dean clears his throat. “Lost in thought.”
“Good job. Let’s put Baby in gear.” Dean explains how the gears work and then asks, “Got it?”
Dean feels a twinge of guilt, but that quickly gets squashed down by his anger.
“See? This attitude is why your coolness level gets a boost. Self-acceptance is cool, my love.”
Meg laughs.
“I know pronounce you husband and husband. You two can kiss each other.” Sam says.
Someone’s standing over him, pressing his hands into his shoulders.
day if the food doesn’t turn out the way we want it to.”
Castiel waits while Dean announces that Castiel will not be paying for this meal because Dean’s treating this time because “now that the funeral business is over, this can count as a date.” And Castiel is weak and he
After presents, everyone pitches in to make breakfast. Castiel feeds Pumpkin in her new bowl with the cartoon bees that Dean bought her. Sam makes hot chocolate and coffee. Castiel and Jack make peppermint pancakes. Dean and Eileen make eggs and bacon and French toast.
Cas gently pulls away and kisses Dean’s forehead. “Thank you, Dean,” Cas whispers. He takes a step back.
Castiel almost tells Dean that he loves him but decides against it. There have been too many big emotions tonight to throw that in the mix. It’s too soon, anyway. Instead, he kisses Dean on the forehead and pulls him close, this time with Dean’s face resting against his chest. Castiel falls asleep to the sound of Dean breathing.
about being out here together so late at night with the wind blowing just a little, under the lamp-lights, and Castiel cannot help but drink in every word Dean says and he does his best to memorize every line of Dean’s smile and every note of Dean’s laughter.
Jack runs out of the room.
Dean can’t imagine today any way but this way: waking up next to Cas, holding hands with Cas while they walk the senior walk with Charlie, Benny, Garth, and Crowley, taking pictures with Bobby and Ellen and Jo after the ceremony, Bobby telling Cas to get his ass in the picture and Charlie taking over the camera while Cas stands beside Dean in the middle of Bobby and Ellen and Jo.
Castiel’s really going to miss Dean over break.
come back? Will he
“Hi Jack.” Castiel waves at Jack.
They eat the snacks and pizza and binge

That’s Cas. That’s such a Cas thing to do. Stubborn bastard.
of the year 2022. Dean’s washing his hands in the bathroom. It’s their last night in the apartment and Dean’s trying not to get homesick about this place. It’s hard not to…this was their first home together. They made this place their own and now they’re moving miles away to some new apartment. It’s a nicer apartment. The kitchen’s bigger and they have a balcony. It’s within walking distance of their grad school and they’re allowed to paint the walls if they so choose.
“Was it cake?” Garth asks.

“Don’t make me be mean to
Dean doesn’t want to feel these things right now. He wants to act like a human being who can function on his own.
“Shut up.” Meg laughs. “I cannot believe they held this thing in the fucking gym. Who the hell thought this was a good idea?”
“So that’s it? I go on a hunt and I die? I’m
Dean’s guilt. How are you cool with that?” There’s anger in Dean’s eyes.
Dean feels his face turn hot. There’s something about someone else ordering dessert for him that stirs something inside of Dean. It’s not something he needs. It’s pie. It’s just something that makes Dean feel good and Cas wants Dean to have things that make him happy…like pie.
Dean shakes his head and tries to concentrate as someone tells a story about how kind John Winchester was.
“Nothing. I’m just happy.”
“Of course, it’s here. This is you and Garth we’re talking about.”
Dean takes a step closer to Cas and says, “Because you’re here.”
“Got it.”
Dean smiles as tears run down his face and he shakes his head. Everything is so fucked up right now. He doesn’t even deserve to feel good at this moment, but he does. Listening to Cas sing feels
Cas giggles and squirms away. “The kind who wanted to take a Romanticism class this semester.” Cas replies.
“We can always get a new microwave, Cas. I’m just glad you’re not hurt.” Dean blinks. “Wait. You’re
Dean shakes his head. He takes a deep breath. He wants to do this. He really does.
A small smile lights Dean’s face and he puts his hand over Castiel’s. Castiel must be close.
“Yes, we are.” Cas yawns.
Dean needs to be able to contribute
Dean-Night, Cas
Dean’s heart twists in his chest. He turns the radio on. “Stuck in the Middle with You” by Stealers Wheel is on and Dean cranks the volume up until he can’t hear Cas anymore. He tries to continue cleaning off the bed, but he just, he can’t do this. There’s something about this guy. He knew about Baby and he knows Sammy and he ordered him
“Any time, my love.”
“What?” Cas asks.
Dean grabs Cas’s shoulder and shakes, trying to be gentle, while knowing that his movements are definitely
would’ve saved you by now? I’m sure he’d like to have a word with you after your last conversation. Unless of course…maybe your precious Dean is dead. Did that ever cross your mind?”
“Yeah, but you love me.”
“Great, I’ll get some coffee. You go ahead and start it okay?” Dean gets up and heads for the door. Then he stops at the door. “Want anything else while I’m up?”
Castiel shakes his head.
“This is ridiculous.
“You’ve mentioned this before, and I’ve always been curious. So, he just…constantly kicks you out? Why?”
“Thank you. It was a beautiful song.”
“Do you have a laundry hamper?” Castiel asks.
feel.
“It’s his birthday today.” Charlie says.
“You knew?”
“Or you simply have an odd taste in music.”
“Winner gets to hold the other. Okay?” Dean’s voice is soft.
Dean’s heart skips a beat. “Okay. I’ll do that.”
“You do the same for me, Dean.” Castiel replies, looking back at the road. “Besides, stories are all about point of view. Perhaps you’re the hero in my story. Perhaps I’m the…I’m the hero in your story. Like I said, it’s all about point of view. Both could be valid. Or perhaps there are multiple heroes in both stories. You, me, Bobby, Meg, Ellen, Crowley, Benny, Charlie, Garth, Gabriel—my brother. Perhaps we’re saved by numerous people. Perhaps this is about all of us.”
He crashes into the door and holds the gift for Cas behind his back.
“So, what did you want to do?” Dean asks. “You look tired. Do you want to sleep?”
They spend the rest of the day watching more movies with those confounding puppets. They get dinner at the diner again—in their usual spot. It’s nice. They’ve developed a routine over the past few days.
“Yeah,” Dean replies.
“I brought you some clean clothes. Do you want them? If you don’t like these, you can try different ones.” Dean says through the door.
Dean laughs. As does most of the crowd. There is a bit of a crowd. Bobby, Ellen, Jo, Eileen, Jody, Donna, and Gabriel. Now that Dean’s looking out at everyone, he notices that Jody and Donna have really hit it off. Like,
“No.” Jack giggles.
. Castiel’s going so fast that the cold wind is making his eyes well up with tears and he’s so tired and
“He looked ready to shit himself. It was perfect.” Dean replies.
“I’m so sorry, Cas.” Dean says. “You deserved better than him.”
Dean presses a kiss to the top of his sleepy angel’s head. Maybe he should just count his blessings—starting with this one in his arms—and try not to get too existential about the rest.
Is that who he wants to be?
. Dean saw
“I’m sorry. It’s just. Your face, Cas.” Dean laughs.
“Thank you for the pj’s. These are fantastic.” Dean says. He’s wearing the slippers Castiel gave him a few days ago, a pair of the fuzzy socks from Castiel, the red and green striped pajama bottoms, and the long-sleeve shirt with the sloth wearing a Christmas hat.
Dean looks over at Cas to find him staring at him. Dean winks at him and gets out of the car. He goes around to the passenger seat and opens the door.
“Wanna talk about it?”
A wide smile spreads across Dean’s face. He leans over and gives Castiel’s knee a little squeeze before quickly walking to the bathroom.
(See the end of the chapter for
Then, as if by magic, the first snowflake falls. Then another. And then another. Castiel hears Jack laugh in delight. Castiel holds his hand out and catches a snowflake. He cannot see it very well and it melts almost as soon as it touches his hand, but it is beautiful.
Does he think talking about it might make him feel better?
Cas always believes in him…even when he shouldn’t. No.
“I sort of did. But I usually don’t do much.”

about his promise to earn his keep. Dean feels flushed from head to toe, and he does not like that. At all. Why does this guy act like he cares so much about Dean? Is this a long-con? What’s the goal?
“If I were to—no—
Cas looks at Dean, but doesn’t say anything. He puts a hand on Dean’s shoulder for a second, then he removes his hand and leads the way to the hotel.
(2019)
After bumping into Castiel that first time, Dean feels like he sees him everywhere.
Hey everyone, online grad school's starting up again so I'm only going to be able to post maybe twice a week now. I think it'll be Tuesdays and Fridays. (Fridays for sure, but I'm not sure if it'll be Mondays or Tuesdays for the beginning of the week post).
Cas stands up and stretches. “I’m pretty tired. I’m going to head back to the dorm.” Cas says.
There’s a thin layer of smoke dissipating in the air. The smell is terrible. It’s all melted metal and plastic and…is that popcorn?
“Love you too, asshat.” Charlie bumps Dean’s shoulder.
“What are you doing here?” Cas asks.
Dean: Favorite plant?
“Nope.”
Dean signs.
Dean: You will never believe what Mom’s doing to me right now.
“It’s good for you to try new things, Deano.” Mom replies.
Sammy blinks and a small smile forms on his face. “Coming right up.” Sammy replies. His hands shake a bit while he signs, and he swipes at his eyes.
How is he here already?
“Are we?”
Castiel starts to reach out to tickle Dean, but then Dean grabs Castiel and tickles him instead. Dean tickles Castiel’s stomach and all Castiel can do is laugh which seems to make Dean laugh. He tries to fight back, but it’s no use. He has been captured.
Cas smiles. “I’m glad you’ve found family here.”
They stand there kissing for a while. Then the snow begins to fall.
Dean looks down and chuckles.
Then Father clears his throat and Castiel feels nauseated.
Dean hands Castiel the cat.
“I have no idea.”
“It’s a seventeen-hour drive. Not including traffic.” Cas replies.
He looks at the clock. It’s December 26, 2001 and Dean thinks there’s something important about the date, but he can’t for the life of him figure out what it is. He can’t remember what he did the past few days. He…he remembers
“You’re so beautiful,” Dean whispers.
“It took you some time to reconcile that with yourself, but yes. I am aware of your sexual orientation, Dean.”
“What’s your name?”
so he’ll either laugh or cry happy tears over the ridiculously earnest and loving man he adores.
“I don’t mind.” Cas replies. “I was thinking about everything that has transpired in these past few months and I’ve been thinking about our apartment. It feels…a little unreal—not in a bad way—but…if I’m being honest, also in a bad way. I fear I will mess things up.”
“Okay, breathe in,” Dean takes in a breath.
Castiel looks at Dean and sees his blotchy face, bloodshot eyes, and shaking smile.
Castiel-What did you have in mind?
Meg-What did you have in mind?
. Meg refuses to explain to Castiel how she knows Castiel’s new roommate, Crowley, and why she hates his guts. Castiel can’t piece that story together.
dork.” Cas winks at Dean.
After breakfast, they put up the tree and decorate it.
Cas signs.
Being human is still a mixture of things. It’s still horrible nightmares but at least Dean’s in bed next to Castiel, holding him as he cries from pain and fear and anger. It’s sitting alone in the kitchen, feeling guilty about being taken care of by Dean. It’s the celebration that was held the day Sam and Eileen came back to the bunker. It’s that time when Castiel was sick for a week, and Dean and Sam and Eileen all took care of him. It’s visits with Jack that are too short but full of happiness.
“You’re sad too; aren’t you?”
Dean puts his free hand out. “Deal?”
Castiel hears Dean let out a small chuckle and smiles.
No. That’s not entirely accurate.
to help Cas, but he’s just
Cas nods again.
to hold his feelings in his chest to let them out only in an angry explosion. Dean
“But I want to protect you and I
Dean smiles and nods. “Let’s do that.”
Dean leans against the sink and chuckles.
Once everyone is effectively covered in snow, they go inside and shower and change into dry clothes. Dean decides today is a snow-day, which makes it a pajama kind of day, so he changes into his black t-shirt, his robe, his hotdog pajama bottoms, and the slippers from Cas. After getting changed, Dean walks over to Cas’s room and knocks on the door.
“All right, take us away, Sammy.” Dean clears his throat.
Dean loves that Cas figured out which episode it was in under two minutes.
Castiel smiles back at Dean. They may not have gotten to see stars tonight, but Castiel has gotten to see Dean smile and as far as Castiel can tell, Dean’s smile is just as wonderous as the stars. Castiel chuckles to himself. Dean will tell him his thoughts are cheesy.
Dean hesitates before saying, “Yeah,”
Dean wakes up next to Cas. He watches his angel sleep. Dean was right. This really is the best Christmas ever. He’s got everything he has ever wanted: Sam’s happy, Dean’s in love, and Dean has a kid. And soon, Dean and Cas will start a new…Dean feels cheesy calling it an adventure, but that’s the best word for it because trying to be normal is a perilous ordeal.
” Sammy looks at Cas. “In my defense, I did keep the secret for a few years.”
But it’s not this apartment.
“Cas!” Dean screams.
happened, Castiel. You entering my life is probably the best thing that has ever happened to me.” Dean says in a quiet voice. “When all seems lost and there’s nothing but despair, you can find joy. That is why I love you. You don’t follow rules. You look for a better way. You take care of the people you love. You even watch over me.” Dean smiles.
. He tries to do so anyway though. “I appreciate the sentiment.” Dean clears his throat as the tops of his ears burn.
When Dean looks at Castiel again, Dean’s face is red. “Do you want to dance?”
“Of course not.” Castiel crosses the room to stand in front of Dean. “You have aged beautifully, and I love every wrinkle on your face.” Castiel gently takes Dean’s face in his hands and kisses his crows-feet. “I would never trade you for anyone.” Castiel kisses Dean’s forehead. “But I think you already know this. You just have trouble believing it.”
Castiel had been standing in the middle of the room, waiting for Dean.
“Love you too.”
Dean wishes he could go with Cas just so he could punch Cas’s father in the jaw—the source of all those hateful things he says to Cas—but Dean knows that he can’t do that. It would only make things worse for Cas.
He remembers a weird dream he had once where a much older Cas says, “You’ll see me again, Dean. I swear, I’m not going to leave you forever.”
“Sometimes, I’ll wake up in your arms and think about how lucky I am to be here with you. And I’ll just,” Dean clears his throat. “I’ll kinda watch you sleep.”
“Ah, ah, ah. Stay right there, Dean.” Naomi says.
“When we go to sleep, can I, can I hold you in my arms this time?” Dean asks. “Would that help?”
“So much for taking my mind off it.” Dean mumbles.

Dean’s sure that he will eventually crash from this high, but he’s going to enjoy the ride until then.
The third stanza of this poem is about history and how the speaker does not feel connected to history. Although Castiel is fairly certain Siken is not talking about the familial cycle of abuse in this stanza, Castiel cannot help but think about it. And how Dean and Castiel are desperately working to break that cycle within their families. How each of their fathers claimed that their treatment was okay because it was what
Why does he care?
“Uh,” Dean scratches the back of his neck. “I don’t know, man. I like cooking. It’s nice to make something for once instead of you know,” Dean looks around before adding, “instead of killing.”
Dean looks at Castiel. Castiel wishes it weren’t so dark out. He can’t make out Dean’s facial expression. He can just barely tell that he moved to look at him.
“Okay,” Dean takes the carrier from Jack and holds the carrier in his lap. Dean gets a text from Sam.
“I’m not sure if it’s love—not yet at least.” Dean admits. “But I’d like to find out.”
“Tell me about your job? It sounds like you’re good at it.”
Castiel smiles back. “Thank you, Dean. You have been exceptionally kind to me. I do appreciate it.”
“Perhaps,” Dean says. “And…and maybe, we save ourselves too. We got away from our dads….and we’re never gonna be like them.”
Dean takes a deep breath. Then he holds out his arms. Charlie links her arm to Dean’s right arm and Benny links his arm to Dean’s left arm. Then they walk down the aisle together. Garth’s in charge of the music and he plays the song Cas chose as soon as the door opens. Cas and Dean both chose the song the other will walk down the aisle to.
Castiel wakes up in Dean’s arms. It’s his favorite way to wake up: warm, in the arms of the man he loves the most.
Someone knocks on the door.
“So, what do you like to eat?” Dean asks.
Castiel checks the time. It’s 10:34AM.
“And I like seeing

Cas’s next song plays.
in them because the only way to get out of the pool…the only way to get what he wants…is to put an end to it all. He will have to be honest with Cas. And the thought of doing that is scarier than anything Dean has faced so far.
But his dad wanted them to hunt. He raised them to hunt. What would he say if Dean stopped hunting to what? Retire with Cas? Go run a restaurant and become the new Ellen? Take Jack with them and let him be normal? Or at least as normal as Jack can be.
Why not before? Are they somehow closer in their friendship now that they have seen the other cry? Castiel does not understand. He
“He can’t tell. That’s the rule.” Eileen smirks.
“Sam,” Cas replies. “But the matching pajamas was my idea. Jack likes to match. I thought it would make nice pictures.”
“No.” Castiel holds on tighter to Dean’s arm. “Let’s just talk for a bit.”
Dean wants to argue with the idea that he’s bad at this stuff, but Charlie’s right. Dean has a pretty bad track record when it comes to relationships. At least so far.
to. But he just couldn’t stay away from the dorky English major who loves bees and coffee and dancing.
“You still could.” Dean says. “Go work with Bobby or Ellen or Jody. Hell, even Rowena would be better than Chuck.”
“I would say today was quite the success.” Dean says as he and Cas get the bed ready. “Claire scored four goals and we made an enemy.”
Cas splits the cake in half and pushes the larger half on Dean’s plate.
“What is Mrs. Clause’s backstory? Who was she before she married Santa Clause?” Cas asks.
“You shouldn’t be thanking me, man. This is bare-minimum shit to not want you to lose something important to you.”
“I’ve got to warn you, I’ve only baked pie once before and it didn’t taste much like pie,” Dean says.
“I Need You” -Tomo
Castiel’s phone starts to ring. It’s Meg. He answers it. “Hello?”
“Hello Dean.” Castiel says as he jogs past him.
believe him. And if Cas is telling the truth, Dean’s not ready to lose him yet. One thing that Dean definitely doesn’t believe in is the forever part. How is someone ever going to find Dean so appealing that they will stick around forever? No one will ever do that.
Dean turns it over and says, “Oh,” His voice breaks.
Dean kisses Castiel back and pulls Castiel on top of him. Castiel laughs.
Castiel looks back at the poker players yelling from the bar’s parking lot as their figures get smaller and smaller.
“Yeah, we’re pretty sad; huh?” Dean nudges Cas’s shoulder.
Cas puts a gentle hand on his shoulder. “Do you want to try to sleep more?”
Dean looks at Cas. He’s wearing the pajamas Dean let him borrow and his dirty trench-coat. He’s hugging his knees to his chest like he’s cold.
Cas nods and he looks so concerned that Dean almost wants to hug him.
A wave of exhaustion crashes over Castiel and Dean presses a kiss to his cheek. “Do you want to try to get some sleep? You look tired.” Dean says.
It’s the morning before Christmas and Dean wakes up on the couch to the sounds of someone cursing and the fire alarm going off. Dean opens his eyes to see that he’s lying on the couch with a blanket over him. He looks into the kitchen and sees Cas taking burnt toast out of the toaster. Cas is in the middle of threatening the toast when Dean comes to his senses and walks into the kitchen.
Castiel almost tells Dean that he loves him. Instead, he takes a step towards him and kisses his cheek. “Until we meet again,” Castiel says, handing Dean his jacket.
Cas laughs and waves at Dean before walking over to Crowley and Meg.
Castiel pulls up Spotify and chooses a playlist at random. “Longshot” by Catfish and the Bottleman plays first.
“Dean, I can get you there and I don’t mind paying for everything.”
“That’s awesome.” Charlie smiles at Dean.
“Hey, look at me,” Dean says.
“Oh, you want to save your family. How…pathetic.” The Empty says. “I bet they came just because they have a new problem for you to solve.”
“Dean,” Cas’s eyes widen. Then he kisses Dean. “I love you, Dean.”
It is December 17, 2020. It is 9pm and Castiel can feel a slight chill in the air. Everyone is on the roof with the purpose of stargazing. Castiel sits beside Dean. Everyone is huddling under Castiel’s new cat blankets. Sam and Eileen share a blanket. Jack huddles under a blanket by himself. Castiel and Dean share a blanket. They’re also sharing a thermos of hot chocolate. Castiel doesn’t dare bring his new bumblebee mug on the roof for fear of dropping it.
Eileen signs.

Castiel looks at Dean. All he sees in Dean’s green eyes is…love.
“This is your husband?” Claire asks.
to adopt so many of us only to mistreat us the whole time.” Castiel says. “I truly cannot fathom why you would do that.”
“I definitely did not mean you.” Dean says.
Castiel tilts his head to the side in confusion. “You want to dance with me?”
“No!” Dean jumps up and stands in front of Cas. “I can’t just drop this. It’s too important.”
“It’s cute that you think we don’t do that anymore.”
Dean stays in the bathroom and listens. And waits.
That’s understandable.
And he hates it.
“Hi Dads.” Jack waves at Castiel and Dean.
helpful. Thanks guys, really.” Dean rolls his eyes.
That’s partly true. He’s still lightheaded and he is hyperaware of every one of his body parts which all feel a little like they have been set on fire.
“’m okay. This feels good.” Dean says into Cas’s middle. “Just give me a second. I’ll get up.”
do. This is
Castiel turns a corner and starts walking. It’s hard to breathe because of the running, but also because there’s a lump forming in his throat. Tears gather in his eyes, but he blinks them back. He’s in so much trouble.
Jack looks stricken. “Maybe it’ll replenish? It didn’t look like he took all of it, but it was hard to tell.”
“Does he know where the bathroom is?” Dean asks.
want to cry now in front of Cas. “No, it’s
“Get ready to take some pictures.” Benny laughs.
“No.” Claire says.
“You’re so pretty, Dean.” Cas says right in Dean’s ear.
“If they think we’re staying to clean up for our own wedding, that’s on them.” Dean replies, revving Baby’s engine.
Castiel looks at the messages from Dean on his phone.
One more chapter left! Thanks for reading!!:D
Cas laughs. “I had to get it right at some point. Catch.” Cas tosses a piece of popcorn into Dean’s mouth.
“He’s being shitty because Claire’s our foster kid. So are several of the other parents. The fact that we’re going to adopt her doesn’t matter. She’s not our blood and they don’t want her on the team with their kids. It’s not just that one douchebag.” Cas scrubs at his face as tears spill down his cheeks.
Castiel shows the driver the address. “Can you please take me here? I’ll pay extra.”
Dean really needs to get a grip.
want to watch right now?” Cas calls from the kitchen.
He doesn’t want to make this about him. It’s not the time.
“I’m sorry your father is so cruel.” Dean says.
Castiel lets go of Dean’s hand and walks over to his nightstand. He puts the fuzzy bee that Dean of 2001 gave him for Christmas on top of the book he’s been trying to read. It sits, smiling up at him as it valiantly guards his book.
Castiel forgets how to breathe for a moment and Dean has the audacity to wink at him.
If Dean cries for a few minutes, that’s his business. Well, it’s also Cas’s business. It’s Cas’s shirt he cries into.
“Oh. Um,” Dean scratches the back of his neck. “Couldn’t sleep.”
“Oh. Yes, I was tossing quite a bit; wasn’t I? Could you check it?”
Dean tries again, “I have a credit card for you. And a wallet. For food and a motel and warm clothes when it gets cold.”
The following days fly by. They’re full of forms to sign, last-minute events with friends, dinners with Bobby and Ellen, texting Sammy, dinners with Bobby and Ellen
“What?” Dean asks.
“Oh Castiel?” The Empty asks in a sing-songy voice.
Dean smiles and wraps his arm around Cas’s shoulders and pulls him close. Dean will just have to wait and see.
“Whoops,” Dean laughs. “I’ll try not to do that next time.”
“Jack? What’s wrong?” Castiel asks.
No. Why would I think that?
“Yeah, I’m fine. Are you okay? What were you running from?”
What would his dad think about this?
Dean smiles at Castiel. There’s something soft in his expression and he walks over to Castiel, gently taking his face in his hands. “Do you remember how when we first met, you told me that good things do happen?”
“Oh yeah, it only happened one time.” Dean looks at Jody Mills, Department Head of English at William and Mary. “Sorry Jody.”
“I love you,” Dean’s voice shakes. “I love you and you’re my best friend and I’m
They stay like this for a while. Dean pulls away first. He yawns and says, “I’m beat.”
Castiel eats his food quickly, trying to figure out what’s going on.
Dean can’t help it. He thinks about his favorite part in the song “Fair” by the Amazing Devil. He hopes that can be true of them.
Dean laughs.
“Yes, my boss believes I am a hard-worker.”
Castiel blinks and says, “It’s really no big deal. I wasn’t paying attention either.”
“Oh, fuck you, Benny.” Dean says without any bite. He feels his face heat up and he wants to kick Benny in the shin just a little bit, but he laughs because he knows that Benny’s way of showing affection is assholery.
“No. We either do or we do not have a deal. Shake on it if we have a deal.” Cas puts his hand out to Dean.
“Well, you know what they say.” Dean grins.
“Cas, this isn’t your fault. Being human is hard. I screwed you over and now you’re trying to make it on your own. None of this is your fault.” Dean has trouble getting the words out.
“I should probably make food now.” Dean sighs.
Charlie gives a thumbs up and points at the door. Her face is redder than her hair.
Dean walks away. “Get away from me.”
Cas bursts out laughing.
“Well, I see we’ve skipped forward a wee bit.” Rowena chuckles. “Anywho, I now pronounce you husband and husband. You may resume kissing.”
Dean catches it and chuckles. “Man, I can’t believe we’re moving out.” Dean tosses a piece of popcorn at Cas as they walk over to the couch.
isn’t supposed to pummel his child with his fists and his words every chance he gets. A
Dean laughs.
Dean shakes his head as if that’s going to solve all of his problems and looks back at the road.
“So, will you help me?”
but it doesn’t work; he swears the squirrel laughs at it.
Castiel hugs Gabriel back. “Yeah, at least there’s that.”
“Anything for you, Dean. Anything.” Cas says. “But honestly, that sounds fun.”
“Dean!”
Dean sighs and walks into the yoga studio. He still can’t believe they’re doing this. “This is an easy class; right? I’m not gonna split in half?”
Cas: Everyone cries on graduation day.
When they get to the gym, Cas says, “Okay, I know you’re excited, but you’re really going to want to take it easy since this is your first time taking this class. It’s quite difficult.”
Cas nods. He squints and stares off into the distance as if the fridge can give him the words he needs to say next. If that
“Thank you,” Castiel signs.
“I met Claire by the swings when my phone died.” Dean explains.
ingest all the wine they taste).
Dean, I miss you. Is it normal to miss someone so much that it hurts?
“Then perhaps you should consider treating yourself with the same humanity you afford everyone else.” Cas suggests. “After all, several of the things you thanked me for are things you’ve done for me such as giving me company when I was upset.
Castiel spends the walk to the kitchen ruminating over these thoughts.
“Oh, fuck yes!” Charlie exclaims.
It was good to see you again, Cas.
April 5
Cas laughs and hugs Dean. “You’ve had a hard day.” Cas says.
for anybody.” Dean gives Castiel’s hand a little squeeze.
All Dean knows is that he aches for Cas. Dean thinks about the first season of the show
“Bye, Benny.” Dean hugs Benny back.
Then Pumpkin jumps onto the table and food flies everywhere.
“Merry Christmas Castiel!” Jack replies. “I’m gonna go wake everyone else up!”
Dean feels his entire body flush as he takes Cas’s hand and Cas pulls him to his feet. He kisses Cas.
Cas disappears and reappears in the driver’s seat.
“Cas,” Dean whispers before taking Cas’s face in his hands and kissing him.
“I’m an angel. Or…I was until Naomi made me a human. It’s her version of a cruel joke. She sent me here to perform a task she deemed impossible to torture me…and future you.”
“You know, if anything’s bothering you—like tonight. You could tell me next time.” Dean says.
Dean waits until he’s sure that Cas and Jack are on their morning walk. Then he marches to Sam’s room and knocks on the door. Sam opens the door. His hair is wild, and Dean makes a mental note to tease his brother about it later.
“Fuck you, Dean.” Charlie laughs.
“Thanks, Cas.” Dean smiles. He looks at the box and seems to be reading the summary. “This looks really cool. Don’t tell Sammy, but I’m actually pretty excited to read this.”
Cas pulls away and looks into Dean’s eyes. “Maybe…maybe what, Dean?” Cas whispers.
“You good?” Dean asks.
“I’m okay.” Cas says quickly.
“Welcome to Williamsburg! If you don’t like the weather, just wait. It’ll change.”
Cas is doing his best to fight that attack-dog spell. He looks like shit. He’s all sweaty and he keeps staring at Dean with these hurt, puppy dog eyes like Dean can help him—like Dean can make his pain go away. Dean can’t do that even though he desperately wants to. There’s something familiar about it. Maybe it’s that dream again. Dean doesn’t understand why it comes up so often—why he remembers so many details in the weirdest moments. It feels like…like more than a dream. And that makes no sense because it’s a
It’s just a small campus and once you think about someone, they seem to appear out of thin air. Dean has been on Castiel’s mind quite a bit as of late. The fellow junior is not exactly hard on the eyes. He’s also quite kind which Castiel believes is a more important quality to focus on when it comes to potential significant others. Not that Dean and Castiel could ever become romantic partners. Castiel has attempted to flirt with Dean on numerous occasions and Dean has only looked a little awkward about it. He hasn’t flirted back (as far as Castiel can tell) which means he might not be interested in Castiel. Castiel can’t exactly blame Dean for not being interested in him, but it’s still disappointing.
“Sounds good.” Jack nods.
Todd helps Dean fill out the rest of the paperwork. Dean lists himself and Castiel as the owners of the cat just to be safe.
“You’re not here because you’re useful, Cas. You’re here because you’re family.” Dean’s voice shakes but at least he’s not yelling anymore.
she’s behind this. She just couldn’t leave him alone. Could she? She always has to go after the angel with the crack in his chassis.
“If you know me then how
Dean-We can’t all be devastatingly handsome like you ;)
Castiel feels a wave of fondness wash over him. Dean never got to experience childhood. Not really. So, it’s nice to see him do small, silly things like this. It’s nice to see Dean’s face light up with childish glee or wonder. Castiel loves watching moments like this when the Dean of 2021 gets to play—even just for a second. He’s away from his father; he’s free to play. And Castiel’s chest tightens the same way it does for the Dean of 2021 at the sight of the Dean of 2001 doing something silly like this. He’s grateful that Dean has entrusted him with this moment.
They have a movie-night packed together in the apartment. There’s only room for three people on the couch and Garth, Benny, and Gabriel called dibs since they transported it to the apartment and hauled it up the stairs because it didn’t fit in the elevator. Everyone else is sprawled out on the floor. Dean’s in the middle of it all. He’s sitting on the floor, leaning against the couch under where Garth sits with his legs criss-crossed. Cas is lying on the floor with his knees up and his torso in Dean’s lap. Dean’s running his fingers through Cas’s hair. Charlie fell asleep an hour ago with her face resting against Dean’s shoulder. She’s snoring…sometimes loudly and Dean’s having trouble not laughing about it. It’s right in his ear, but he doesn’t want to make too much noise and wake Charlie up. Beside Charlie, is Jo who is asleep, curled in a ball underneath a blanket that Gabriel dropped over her thirty minutes ago. Dean watched Gabriel do it and was glad that at least Cas had Gabriel to get him through his shitty childhood. Dean figures if the guy does something nice like that for someone he met today then he probably did other nice stuff for Cas growing up…at least that’s how Cas makes it sound. He’s not exactly chatty about his childhood. And Dean doesn’t blame him. Obviously. To Dean’s left is Meg who is asleep with her legs propped over Cas’s knees. Beside Meg is Crowley who is sitting on the floor, watching the movie. That’s better than fifteen minutes ago when he suggested that they draw on Meg’s face with a permanent marker.
for the past ten years after all.”
Benny hugs Dean back and then pulls away. He’s grinning. “Open it.”
“Okay, we should let these cool for a bit. Do you wanna get some lunch?” Dean asks as he turns the oven off.
“My turn for what?” Castiel tilts his head to the side in confusion.
They sit together and eat breakfast while they listen to music. Dean’s first song is “Don’t Stop Me Now” by Queen. Cas’s first song is “Starships” by Nicki Minaj. Dean’s next song is “Come and Get Your Love” by Redbone.
“Yeah, but that doesn’t have to mean marriage.” Dean shrugs.
expecting that response.
Dean doesn’t know what to say. He just stares at Cas and feels grateful to have him in his life. Cas really does love him so much. That’s good…Dean loves him too. So, fucking much.
Based on the agony that had been etched on Cas’s face in the wee hours of Monday morning, Dean has a feeling that Cas really does understand something about breaking old habits.
“Yeah?” Dean asks.
Castiel closes his eyes and finally drifts off to sleep.
“You’re not a child, Dean. Life isn’t fair.” Mom scolds.
. Not the microwave. I mean, I don’t love the smell and we should probably take Sammy out to eat for lunch so this place can air out a little—if we can figure out how to do that without opening the window too much—but I would much rather smell this smell for the rest of my life than have you get hurt just now.”
Cas tilts his head to the side and stares at Dean. “Dean? What is this?” Cas asks.
Castiel is trying to read anything he can get his hands on.
“Sure,” Cas offers Dean his hand.
happen, Dean.” Castiel says in a quiet voice.
. If that makes any sense.
Castiel loves this picture of them too. It’s from the day after Jack rescued Castiel from The Empty and everyone stayed up all night watching the
“Yeah, whichever one you want.” Dean’s voice is soft and Castiel has a feeling Dean is staring at him.
“Dean, this is about you because of things that happen in the future. Or at least they
. Castiel’s not sure if perhaps he has a concussion in addition to the staples in his head, because he wasn’t paying attention when the doctor was talking to him last night. He also might just be tired. He can feel his exhaustion in his bones, and he feels dizzy. He’s hoping to be able to keep this to himself so he can take a nap later or just sleep tonight. He got maybe an hour of sleep last night. He just…he hates sleep. It terrifies him because it reminds him of being in The Empty. Castiel has spent many nights in the past six months lying awake in Dean’s dark bedroom, holding onto Dean like he is his anchor, like he is the only thing that will stop him from going adrift in the sea of dark. But Castiel was not a human then. He did not need much sleep, but he unfortunately does now.
Trigger warnings: references to child abuse and lots of curse words
“You really love Cas; don’t you?”
Dean opens the bag and pulls out the book inside. It’s a book of love poems throughout the ages. There’s a sticky note on the cover that says, “You should read some of these to that angelic friend of yours with those blue, blue eyes. He’ll probably date you if you asked.”
When the timer goes off, Dean pulls the cinnamon rolls out of the oven and sets them to rest on the stove.
“Not Yet/Love Run (Reprise)” -The Amazing Devil
May 3, 2021
“Let’s decide together later.” Jack says.
January 23
“Why would you be an exception to the crying rule of humanity?” Cas asks.
“Why don’t you bring him here?”
“I love you too.”
“I’m so glad you’re here.”
Castiel looks out the window.
Dean can’t help but stare at his classmate.
Dean takes the mug in both hands and walks away.
Eileen signs.
.” Cas shrugs.
Dean looks at Charlie’s and Benny’s reflections in the mirror. They’re wearing matching green suits with blue and green flannel ties. Dean’s wearing a black suit jacket with a white button-down shirt, a green vest, and black dress pants. He can’t believe only five years ago he was helping Benny get ready for his wedding to Garth. Now Charlie and Benny are in here helping Dean get ready to marry Cas. Damn, time sure does fly.
Patricia brings them their food. They eat in an awkward silence for a few minutes.
Sammy doesn’t reply, but Dean can hear him laughing as he walks away from Dean’s door. Little shit.
When Dean comes back, he takes Castiel’s bandage off. He’s gentle and he talks to Castiel about a book he’s reading in a soft voice as he slowly works the bandage off. Then Dean runs the tub-water and checks the temperature. He explains what he’s doing in the same soft, steady voice as he works. Dean’s hands are gentle as he runs the warm water through Castiel’s hair, allowing only a little water to run over the staples. He carefully cleans Castiel’s wound first and then cleans the rest of Castiel’s hair. Castiel never noticed that he had so much hair until now. And Dean is cleaning all of it with such care.
“How do you think he treated
Castiel smiles. That is an accurate assessment.
Dean looks at Cas to see Cas giving Meg his patented What-The-Fuck-Meg look. Dean grins.
“Ooh, shopping. I like shopping.” Jack says.
“Yeah, it’s Christmas Eve, and I think you should be generous tonight.” One of the poker players walks towards Castiel.
Dean’s in the kitchen before Cas says the second “fuck” and he’s greeted by a microwave that is
“Even Crowley?” Castiel asks.
But that was then. This is now.
The Empty walks in front of Castiel. He looks like Castiel again.
Dean stares at the space where Cas once was. Then he looks at Naomi. “What the hell did you do to him? Where is he?” Dean demands.
Castiel can only nod as he stares into those beautiful green eyes.
“Cas? Hey, you okay?” Dean asks.
“When we renew our vows, I get to go first.” Castiel sniffles.
“You don’t need to talk about it, but here’s something to make the night less shit.” Dean says.
Cas takes Dean’s hand and presses a kiss into his knuckles. “Yes, Dean. They do.”
And Dean wishes yet again that Ellen could be his mom. Because she’s the closest thing he has ever had to one.
“You know what we need to do?” Charlie asks Dean.
Badly.
“Okay, Dean.” Castiel whispers.
Images of Michael using Dean’s hands to kill Cas flash through his head and Dean cuts Cas off, “Sam told me. Ain’t no thing.”
?” Sam asks.
“I’ve never actually cooked an elaborate Christmas dinner before, so we’ll see if that actually works out. But I’d like to make some mashed potatoes—ooh and mac and cheese!” Dean’s face breaks out into a wide grin.
It’s May 9
“I just want to be wherever you want me to be.” Castiel answers.
“Of course,” Gabriel says. “And I want to hear all about that Dean of yours when you get the chance.”
“Dean,” Castiel whispers again because he’s here. He has come to rescue him.
“I can go with your next time, so you have more fun.” Jack offers.
“I’m not mad at you, Cas. Mistakes were made but I’m not mad at you. I’m just glad you’re okay.” Dean says.
“Dean?” Cas sounds worried. “What’s wrong?”
Dean shakes his head, trying to focus on Cas.
when he sees the gesture. Why the fuck does he want to relax right now?
isn’t really the right word. Maybe it’s more like freer or unburdened. He’s not bearing the weight of having been alive as long as he has. He’s not worried about the imminent deaths of family and friends. He’s not upset because of the cause he served for all those years that turned out to be based in cruelty and destruction. He’s not heartbroken because his fellow angels have cast him out. He’s…at peace when he sleeps.
He starts picking up yoga mats and foam blocks off the floor. He glances at Castiel again. Castiel’s watching Dean. Dean winks and Castiel chuckles.
That is, until Cas laughs and says, “I love you.”
” Dean clings to him. He doesn’t mean to, but he does.
“Uh, well, um.” Castiel looks away. “Dean’s upstairs right now. He’s sleeping.”
All he knows is that although they’re not talking, neither Castiel nor Dean seems to want to be apart for very long right now. It’s…nice to feel wanted. But it’s also confusing. If Dean wants Castiel around, why won’t he talk to him?
Dean does it again.
“Okay,” Cas boops Dean on the nose.
Dean hugs Cas back. “It’s okay. You don’t need to apologize. You didn’t do anything wrong.”
Dean feels warm all over from Cas’s rendition of “You’re My Best Friend” by Queen. Dean hugs Cas tighter and says, “I’m never gonna get over you singin’ Queen songs to me.”
It’s still better than being in his dorm where Crowley is doing only-he-knows-what with whoever he went on that date with tonight. Despite Crowley’s insistence on being involved in Castiel’s love-life (more like lack thereof) Crowley refuses to tell Castiel anything about his love-life except when he needs Castiel to not be in the room. Like tonight. At 1:46AM. Castiel loves it. He’s just having the
yours.”
“Thanks for that.” Dean takes a step forward and stabs Castiel in the chest.
Dean puts his phone down and says, “Maybe,”
It’s not important. But it is. Because in the dream, Cas promised everything would be okay—he promised that Dean would make it. And even though the promise was all in Dean’s head, it’s what helps him get out of bed in the morning sometimes.
Dean is not particularly talented in the art of silence. Even short periods of silence make Dean feel like crawling up the walls. He can’t stop moving. He taps his fingers against his legs, he plays with the bottom of his flannel, he wiggles his fingers around. He really hopes he’s not creeping Castiel out. He really just wanted to be nice and he’s probably coming off as weird.
Dean steps in front of Cas. “Leave him alone. Why are you two even here? You
“Like I said, you’re my friend.” Is all Cas says.
“I know, it’s not fair. And I hate that I’m doing this to you. But, if I have to be stuck in time somewhere, then selfishly, I’d rather be stuck with you. Dean said I’m allowed to be selfish sometimes.” Castiel tilts his head to the side. “Granted, he was talking about the tv when he said that, but I think it applies to other circumstances.”
“You’re too good to me, Cas.”
Charlie comes over at 3:50PM.
Dean and Cas just stood outside the school building for a few minutes holding hands.
Dean laughs. “I think we’re gonna be just fine, Cas.”
There are a lot of pancakes in the kitchen. Dean takes three. They are freaking amazing. They’re so much better than the pancakes that Dean makes. Half the pancakes have pieces of apples. The other half have chocolate chips. Dean is never making pancakes again. That will be the job of Cas and Jack.
“Peppermint mocha for Castiel.” The barista says.
Dean doesn’t know what to say because that was a lot of feelings to process at once. Dean wants all those things too, but actually saying them out loud is so hard sometimes.
that he doesn’t understand.
“Shithead.”
Did Dean Winchester just call Castiel cute?
“Yes. But when you’re done eating for the moment and you don’t need food anymore. What is the term for that?”
Dean looks over at Eileen who’s holding Milton in her lap. Cas dressed Milton in a little suit for the wedding and Eileen offered to let Milton sit in the front with her.
Castiel just laughs and takes Dean’s hand. “I don’t mind.”
Dean smiles. That’s fair. Dean would probably also panic if they were to go on what Cas calls a “date-date” so it’s better to keep things mellow if they can.
“Wait!” Dean says as he goes into the trunk. Dean grabs the trench-coat—Cas’s trench-coat—the one he has carried from car to car for the past few months. The one he has cried into countless times when he was alone. The one he just couldn’t part from no matter how many times Sam suggested that it might be time to let it go.
, but he puts the song on.
Dean blinks and looks at Rowena. “Yeah?” he asks.
“That was awesome, man! Did you see their faces when you won? They were so pissed!” Dean’s grinning from ear-to-ear.
No. It does not.
They don’t allow Dean to go past the waiting room, so Castiel is left to endure hours of uncomfortable conversations with doctors and strange instructions regarding pain pills and frustrated glances from nurses and doctors because Castiel doesn’t understand what’s going on.
“What about my dad?”
Cas hugs Dean back—tightly. “I love you too.”
Castiel-Like this bee
sounds worthwhile.
Castiel’s phone buzzes. “Thank you, Dean; hang on a moment please.”
Lunch is not any better. Cas is happily chomping away on a burger. It’s his third cheeseburger. And Dean is trying his best to hold it together. Cas is just…he’s sweet and he’s cute and Dean’s brain is starting to short-circuit every time Cas smiles. This is very bad. Because if Dean’s starting to develop these types of feelings for him, it’s going to suck when he starts to inevitably believe him about where he came from and then Cas will somehow return home. Dean’s not ready for E.T. to go home yet. It’s December 23, so he has three days left with Cas. It doesn’t feel like enough time.
Cas’s eyes open and Dean is greeted by a bright blue that nearly takes his breath away.
For now, he wants to have a nice night. One last good night before he goes into battle.
Castiel seems to deflate a little, but laughs anyway.
Castiel agrees.
Castiel does and he can see his older brother waving at him in the dim light of the rising sun.
and scurries out of sight.
Castiel and Dean look at each other laugh some more.
“That’s a good idea.” Dean replies.
They pop some popcorn and watch tv. Well…they try to. Nobody can decide on a show. Cas wants to watch
“You’re gonna get through this,” Dean says. “Okay?”
“So, wait, a minute. You’re expecting me to believe that angels are real. You are one. Or you
screw up, who cares? Cas loves you. He won’t care if you end up saying something awkward.” Charlie wraps an arm around Dean’s shoulder.
Dean-He promised to split the twenty bucks with me, but we’ll see
Dean smiles and types his new favorite for Cas.
Dean sighs, he’d like to be that lucky asshole.
Jack hugs Dean. Then Jack pulls away and looks at the box.
The magnitude of Castiel’s relief is unprecedented. If he hadn’t allowed himself to enjoy retiring with Dean…if he hadn’t accepted that they could have a happy ending after all they had been through, perhaps it would not have been so bad to be spontaneously ripped away from it all. But he did. He did let himself be happy. And now the Dean of 2001 has returned him to his home.
“Perfect. Write him a note and give it to him during your class. Wait until the class is over though. No point in freaking him out.”
“You looked a little lost. Can I do anything for you?” Cas asks.
“No. But I do want to get some eventually.”
Castiel doesn’t even know if it was delicious because his whole mouth
“I’ve already got that covered. Thanks though.” Dean puts his wallet back in his pocket. “Thanks Todd.”
“I think this might be my favorite part of the day too. I enjoy this time we spend together when the world seems to go still.”
“Wait!” Garth says. “I forgot the rings!”
“I don’t,” Castiel feels a sob rip through him. “You
This isn’t the first time Gabriel has hugged Castiel after their father hit him, but hopefully, this will be the last.
Dean turns over in his sleep. Dean does this a lot. He moves in his sleep nearly every hour. Castiel wonders if all humans do this or if it is only Dean. Castiel does not really care to find out. He only wants to spend these precious moments with Dean. His precious Dean who still has one hand gripped onto Castiel’s shirt as if he is afraid that Castiel might disappear again. Oh Dean.
“You’re my friend, Cas. If you hurt, I hurt. That’s how it works.”
The only problem is the sleeping-situation. This was the last motel room available and there’s only one bed. And Dean can’t stop looking at it.
Dean walks past the Sadler Center when he hears music blaring. Dean stops and looks around.
“Yeah,” Dean chuckles. “I don’t know what came over me.”
bitch.”
Dean takes the bookmark and marks his page with it. “Thanks, Cas.”
Dean chuckles. “I think it would be cool to be really strong. But I’m not the hero. I’m just the writer. What about you?”
“I love you.” Castiel whispers.
“Yeah, she has had
Dean chuckles and hugs Castiel back.
“Orange. Yours?”
,” Castiel sobs as he buries his face in Dean’s neck.
Castiel walks out of the dorm and as soon as the cold air hits his face, it’s like he experiences a burst of energy and panicked flurry. He runs to his dorm, fumbles with his card and opens the door, runs up the stairs, gets into his room, and shoves all his shit into his suitcase. There really isn’t a lot of shove. He packed up yesterday afternoon as if that would help make the ordeal end sooner.
“Castiel Novak, the best part of my day is when I get to go to sleep at night. Not because the day is over, but because sleep means I get to hold you, or I get to be held by you. And that is the highlight of my day. Just…just being with you.” Dean says. “So, I vow to wake up every morning with you and make breakfast while you prepare the coffee. I vow to have long conversations about books or anything else—but it’s usually books—over coffee every day. I vow to share the tv even though you put
“I’m sorry Dean.”
Dean hugs Castiel back.
Castiel boops Dean’s nose. “I don’t mind some boops.”
Dean sighs.
“Why?”
“Anything for you, Cas.” Dean reaches out and grabs onto Castiel’s arm. (Probably because Castiel’s hands are full.) Dean gives Castiel’s arm a little squeeze and says, “That’s how I’m trying to do things now.”
Dean smiles at Cas. He’s here.
That's it for this story!:)
“Hey, is there anything else I can get you two?” The server’s name-tag says Patricia.
“Can I give you your present for today?” Dean asks.
“Yeah,”
“Guess I have some shopping to do.” Dean says.
The car ride is quiet.
Pumpkin doesn’t like that Castiel is moving so much, so she hops onto the stairs Dean installed on the bed today and lies down on the bed Dean bought for her.
When it’s over, Dean dries Castiel’s hair, being careful to avoid the injury. Then he puts a fresh bandage over the staples. He helps Castiel put his t-shirt on afterwards and when he’s done, he smiles at Castiel and says, “There, good as new.”
“Yeah, love you too, old man.” Dean replies.
Trigger warnings: mentions of abuse, being disowned, and homophobia
“Um,”
Castiel nods. “Tickle fight.”
“Practicing?” Dean asks. “Oh, for your class. Duh.” Dean chuckles. “Your class was really fun by the way. Did I tell you that?”
. I’m so happy for you, Clarence.”
This makes Dean smile.
Castiel hugs himself. He remembers years ago when he had been put under a spell by Rowena and Dean had put something warm and soft over his shoulders. He wishes Dean were here and had whatever the magical fabric was. Castiel’s too tired to remember what it was right now. He just wants Dean. He wants comfort and Dean’s the only one who can provide that right now because he’s the only one here in the bunker with Castiel. And because Castiel wants to have a real conversation with Dean. He
Sam looks at Castiel and Castiel nods for Sam to greet Dean next.
“Well, you” Cas does air-quotes with his fingers, “

“I won’t leave.” Dean has a grounding hand just under Castiel’s neck. “You’re gonna be okay. Just get some rest.”
to have his phone on silent. He didn’t
“Cas!” Dean yells, rushing over to him.
It’s so strange because before he had never really noticed Castiel—not that much at least. Now he’s seeing him everywhere, usually dawning a tan trench-coat, black slacks, and black boots, or a yellow, black, and white flannel, black skinny jeans, and Converse with a cartoon bee print on them.
Cas stiffens and doesn’t say anything.
seem freer. He hasn’t even mentioned hunting since Jack rescued Castiel from The Empty. Castiel is not sure what that means, but he is glad that Dean is at least taking a vacation. Dean deserves to rest.
Dean shakes his head.
Crowley holds up a blue tie and says, “Found it.”
“Um, can I get a reaction, please?” Dean asks. “Also, we’re working. Why are you on your phone?”
“Can I hug you?” Castiel asks.
“So why are there different rules for you than there are for me?” Dean asks. “Why are you less worthy of protection and concern than I am?”
“I never got to be a child!” Dean’s having trouble getting the words out and there are tears gathering in his eyes. “I had to take care of myself! I had to avoid him at all costs otherwise I had to come up with an excuse to tell my teachers where the new bruises came from! I was really good at it too because nobody ever called child protective services! No one noticed! And it never would’ve happened at all if he weren’t such a piece of shit or if you had taken me with you! I didn’t want you to be stuck with him! I just wanted you to not leave me! You should have saved me too!”
to sleep because if he sleeps, he’ll have nightmares, but if he continues on like this it’ll be like reliving his experience in The Empty only this time he’s surrounded by light and he’s in his safe place and it’s almost worse because he’s supposed to be safe and
It’s December 20, 2020 and Jack wakes everyone up at 6am on the dot because he saw that it had snowed five inches the night before. There has been a thin layer of snow on everything since the night they went stargazing, but now everything is completely covered in snow. It’s cute that Jack is this excited about snow. It’s unfortunate that Jack ran into Dean’s room at ass-o’clock when Dean wanted to sleep…
“You’re safe with me. It’s okay to cry.”
“Would you like me to kiss you here? Under the moonlight?” Cas asks.
It’s Saturday, February 13, and Dean’s in the Williamsburg Regional Library. Dean likes this library a lot. It’s where he spends most of his time on the weekends whenever he’s not working or hanging out with Charlie or Benny. Or as things have gone these days, when he’s not bumping into Castiel.
So now Castiel is packing a bag.
“Dean?” Cas asks. “What is this?”
But Cas doesn’t leave.
proud of you.” Dean tells Cas.
“What? So, you’re excited about this now?” Dean asks.
“You picked the wrong guy if you wanted a

“Do you need a nap or something or do you want to go get some Christmas stuff?” Dean asks.
Dean reaches out for Castiel and then seems to think better of it because he pulls his hand back.
by Seanan McGuire. There are also two adult fantasy novels:
Cas doesn’t catch it. It hits his forehead and falls onto the floor. Dean grins at the cute face Cas makes when it hits him in the forehead. Cas picks up the piece of popcorn and throws it at Dean. Dean catches it in his mouth and smirks at Cas who rolls his eyes.
“We need to make a big Christmas dinner this year.” Dean announces. “Bring everyone to the bunker and we’ll make a big meal.”
“I found some stuff that might help you sleep,” Dean says. “I also found you a light jacket to wear under your trench-coat so you can layer up.”
Charlie runs to Dean yelling, “Dean!”
“You’re not useless.” Dean gently puts a hand on Castiel’s shoulder.
He should tell Dean that he loves him.
Castiel has no idea how that area could be ticklish, but Dean’s giggle is the cutest sound he has ever heard.
“It’s Christmas Eve,” Castiel deeply wishes he could’ve thought of something else to say, but that was the first thing that came to mind.
“Now, let’s go get your mac and cheese cups.” Dean says before pressing a kiss onto Cas’s knuckles.
“Maybe later.”
“I love you, ya dork.”
Dean hugs Cas back and rests his face on his shoulder.
Dean doesn’t know what to say. He really doesn’t know what to do...he just holds Cas close and listens.
Castiel reaches out and gives Dean’s wrist a gentle squeeze. This seems to be the family language; Castiel hopes to become fluent in it one day.
“I think it’s safe to say it because it already got it.” Jack says.
Castiel hangs up his phone, grateful to no longer be talking to his father. Their conversations can be…what’s the right word? Tedious? Exhausting? Exhausting is probably the optimum word. How could it be anything less than exhausting to speak to someone who cannot accept Castiel the way he is? His father can’t even accept the watered-down cisgender heterosexual version of Castiel that Castiel pretends to be every time he interacts with his father. His father would probably disown him if he knew that Castiel is gay.
Dean lies in bed and wonders how he’s going to fix everything. He remembers that dream again—the one where Cas is human—in the dream Cas made it seem like being human was temporary. Is that how it will happen in real life? Will Cas get his wings back? How?
“Welcome home,” Cas smiles.
thoughts jump around in his head, Castiel sits in the kitchen and tries not to cry all night.
Charlie grins at Castiel. “Honestly, this class was really fun. I usually feel more awkward dancing in public—I still do it, because fuck embarrassment—but it was nice to be surrounded by fellow awkward dancers. Well, except for some of the people in the front and you. You’re actually good at this.”
“No. This is not a tragedy. If you can’t save me from this, I’m sure someone else will. Our family is particularly obdurate.”
“It’s fine, Cas. Are you hurt?” Dean asks, looking Castiel up and down.
Dean’s heart drops.
The words make Dean feel like
“No problem.” Dean waves him off.
Thank you all you awesome people who read this!!:D
It’s 2AM and Dean gets up to use the bathroom. When he’s done, he heads for the kitchen to get a quick snack. That’s when he hears it: crying—no, crying’s not the right word. Sobbing. He hears sobbing. And there’s only one other person in the bunker and that’s Cas which means that Cas is in the kitchen, crying his heart out. And he didn’t ask Dean for help. He’s just sitting there in his own personal hell because the two of them haven’t had a real conversation since they got Cas back.
“Guess what Cas?” Dean whispers.
. And he seems so ridiculously earnest about everything and he ate
“Let’s go downstairs.” Castiel says.
“Yeah, she will not thank you for being late.” Dean says.
“I suppose.”
“Yeah, I should probably feed you.” Dean rubs his eyes and then wipes his hands on his jeans. He gets up, rummages with stuff in the nightstand and then says, “Let’s go.”
“Thank you for the headphones. Mine were getting old.” Dean says. “And I thought you might want to have something to take notes on while you do your bee-research, so that’s why I got you the notebook and pens. I mean, you should write whatever you want in there, but that’s why I got it for you.”
“I would let you go ten miles per hour,” Dean says.
“I’m fine. I’m an adult. I should’ve drunk water and eaten food. It was not—nor will it ever be—your responsibility to make sure I eat stuff and drink water. Okay?”
“Zachariah sent me to the future. You’re there. The angels left and you were…you were still uh…you were with me, but you were—"
Dean’s eyes are shining and he’s smiling brightly at Castiel. He’s so beautiful.
Dean feels…actually…he doesn’t know what he feels. He just…he just wants to sleep.
“Do you want me to drive?” Castiel asks in a quiet voice.

The toast is black and falling apart, so yeah, there’s no coming back from that.
It’s 2:13AM and Castiel’s on a run. He’s listening to “The Horror and the Wild” by The Amazing Devil as he runs and trying to stop himself from thinking about the shitty, shitty conversation he had with his father eight hours ago. His father spent

Cas lets out a small sob. “It’s okay now. Thank you for wanting me here.”
Cas takes the pj’s in his hands and smiles from ear to ear. “Thank you.” Cas hugs Dean.

“Okay. Can you go first to give me an example?”
Thanks for reading!!:D
Dean hugs Castiel and holds him tight as Castiel cries into his shoulder.
“Yeah, of course I am. Cas, I care about
“I forgot to take my pain medication.”
“I could sleep on the floor if it makes you feel better.” Cas offers.
