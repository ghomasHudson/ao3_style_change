“Callum…” John pondered the name, rolled it around in his mouth a few times to test the weight and feel of it.  “It’s a possibility.”
As he walks up to the front door he hears Mycroft’s car pull away, leaving him and Sherlock completely alone in the boy’s house as early night settles in around him.  His knock sounds loud in the still darkness around him, and he wonders if Sherlock’s neighbours are able to hear it.  He hopes not.
John chuckles softly and holds out his arms in a silent invitation for Sherlock to come sit on his lap.  The teen moves towards him without a second thought, coming up to John and straddling his legs as he lowers himself onto the man’s thighs so that they are face to face.  “All right,” John starts as he settles into the chair more comfortably with the new addition of Sherlock’s long body.  “We’ll just wait for you to get tested and then we can—”
Jesus, John has never known anyone who is so fucked up that they think that this is the way a relationship is supposed to be.  That Sherlock would say this, think that he has to sink so low just to make John want to stay with him, is heartbreaking.  John wishes like hell that he could fix the boy, make him see that he doesn’t have to demean or degrade himself just to get someone to love him.  He promises himself that he will spend the rest of his life trying to teach Sherlock that, if Sherlock will let him.
John shakes his head, trying to clear it mostly, but also rebuffing Sherlock’s words and willing them to go away.  “No, Sherlock, no,” he states frantically, trying to calm himself with his own words.  “There’s no feelings; there’s nothing to be reciprocated or returned.”  He looks the boy squarely in the face because he wants Sherlock to know that what he is saying is the God’s honest truth, he has to make Sherlock understand that
ing sound with the tip of his tongue against his teeth, “little boys shouldn’t say such things.  That’s dirty.”
John’s fingers wrap tighter around Sherlock’s hard cock, getting a firm grip on the slick flesh, and pumping.  “Fuck my hand,” he orders.
He gives a small nod, satisfied, and then starts softly.  He begins by warming the skin up with nothing more than a slight smack, on the fleshy part of Sherlock’s arse where he knows the feeling is little more than a sting, a tease that will drive Sherlock wild.
When he goes to see Sherlock at the coffee shop later that night, he is nervous.  It is the first time that they will meet as—he stops, drawing a blank as he searches for a word to describe them.
John takes full advantage of it.  He pushes Sherlock back against the cushions, laying him down, and runs needy hands across the front of the teen’s trousers, undoing his flies hastily, eager to get inside and feel Sherlock against his skin as he crawls over the brunet, in between his legs.  Together they manage to get Sherlock’s shoes, socks, trousers, and pants off, and his button down shirt hangs open limply across his pale torso.  They divest John of all of his clothes as quickly as possible as well, and the man suddenly curses the fact that they didn’t have the foresight to stop and grab up some lube.
As he sat at the edge of the bed, his hands came to rest in his lap, holding the picture frame with the sonogram in it.  He stared down at the photograph and his fingers softly ran along it, gliding smoothly against the glass.  The day he had found the picture and shown it to John, the blonde man had said that it was a good sign, and Sherlock had agreed with him, both men looking desperately for something that they could grasp onto in the middle of the destruction that had seemed to be drowning them that day, suffocating them.
“Why did you do this to me?” he suddenly asked, unable to keep the words in his mouth any longer.  “
He wonders briefly if he’s gone mad, and then he wonders if going mad is supposed to feel this fantastic.
John manages to dodge Mike for the next few days at school, so he doesn’t feel too poorly about the fact that he hadn’t broken up with Sherlock like he had meant to do after speaking to his friend the other night.
And now they sat in the middle of a room full of heterosexual couples, a small, plastic, ethnically androgynous baby doll in Sherlock’s hands as he stared at it in uncertainty, holding on to one of its arms with just the tips of his index finger and thumb.  John cringed as he looked around the room and saw everyone sneaking curious, conspicuous glances at them.  He seriously doubted that they had ever been in a more ridiculous situation than this one.
“Then fix me,” Sherlock whispers, craning his head up and kissing John softly on the lips.  “Fix me,” he keeps repeating between kisses.
“I know what he’s been telling you,” Sherlock continued, and John got the distinct impression that Sherlock was trying to shame him with his words—and, if that were the case, it was working wonders.  John visibly cringed as Sherlock spoke, not sure he could stomach listening to the man for a moment longer.  “I know that he still talks to you about his feelings for you and I know what you’re starting to think about the whole situation.”
After a moment, John heard Sherlock whispering, soft words that tore at John’s heart to hear said in the wet, broken baritone of his lover.  “If I burn out…I could just slip away.  Can I hide in you, John?” Sherlock asked, tightening his grip on John’s shoulders in a crushing hug.  “We can just stay here, safe, with each other.”
John smiles at him reassuringly, the edges of it tipped with sadness and remorse, ashamed that his actions have already caused Sherlock to doubt John and himself.  “Always,” he answers Sherlock’s question without thinking, a searing promise burning between them.  John wants to regret it as soon as the words are out of his mouth, knowing that it’s too much too soon, but finds that he can’t.  The answer is true, and he knows it.  He has always wanted Sherlock, from the days when he first started getting to know him better, and he will
No words were enough to convey his gratitude, he knew that.  These people had given him so much more than he had ever thought anyone in his life would
John made to move towards the barricade, intent on running through 221 Baker Street until he found their landlady, dead or alive, but Sherlock had thankfully recovered enough of himself to reach a hand out to stop John, explaining quickly, “She had a date tonight, John.  Mr. Chatterjee from Speedy’s was taking her out to celebrate his divorce.  Don’t you remember hearing her getting ready earlier?”
And then John turned around and left, shutting the door to the nursery behind him with a small click that sounded like a gunshot going off right into Sherlock’s heart.

“I want to,” Sherlock whispers against his mouth, lips wet from the trailing kisses and licks he has lavished across John’s torso.  “I want to kiss each one of them, taste them all.  You don’t have to be ashamed of them—they brought you here.  They brought you to me.”
He presses a third finger carefully into Sherlock’s stretched hole, knowing Sherlock probably isn’t ready but not caring overly at the moment.  Sherlock, however, simply moans and pushes back into him, wanting more, urging John deeper.  John can’t help but chuckle.  Always so impatient, his little Sherlock.  He shoves his fingers in deeper, probing, stretching, and Sherlock hisses and arches at the sudden sting of pain, but doesn’t try to pull away.  John pumps his fingers in and out of the boy’s open arse, scissoring them wide and drawing the preparation out for a moment longer, but he knows that it isn’t really necessary; Sherlock is more than ready to be taken.
John, of course, found this all rather amusing and “endearing” as he liked to put it, but Sherlock thought it was a particular type of trap meant to torture him, seeing as the more he ate at dinner, the worse the case of heartburn he seemed to get later that night, right around bedtime.
Two fingers slip in with a little more resistance, but John is gentle and slow, methodical.  He watches Sherlock carefully but there isn’t the slightest hint of pain on his face or his body.  “It’s not painful at all?” he asks Sherlock one last time as he slips his two fingers out of Sherlock’s body slowly, feeling around one last time for tearing in his rectal walls.  “Not even a little bit of soreness?”
So he just nods his head, giving her one last look.  She is staring at him from across the room, watching him to see what his next move will be.
Sherlock rolls his eyes at that.  His stride as they walk becomes wider in his agitation, making John have to rush to keep up with his longer legs.  “John, no one else wants to be friends with me,” Sherlock tells him, voice filled with irritation.  “And you had just told me earlier that I should go back on Monday and try to make friends with him again,” he points out to the doctor unhelpfully.
“Oh my God, John, you have become so paranoid!” Mary shouts, exasperated.  “Am I not even going to be allowed to have friends, now?  Is that what you want?  To keep me here, in this house all day long, only going out for work, while you’re off with Mike to the pub every night of the week?”
“Yes,” John agrees with a smile.  “It is.  And I can always tell when you’re ready for me; your body goes slack and pliant against mine.  It’s like you’re giving yourself up to me completely.  Just like that,” John says, and Sherlock can feel it, too—the way he relaxes, opens up fully.  Interesting.  He has never paid so much attention to his body before, never really thought to, and it surprises him that John obviously has, that John can read him like a book.
They continue to meet each other at the coffee shop sometimes, when they aren’t able to go to Sherlock’s house because his father has stumbled back to sleep off his current bender.  John hates these times the most, because he knows at the end of the night Sherlock has nowhere else to go but home.  If Sherlock goes there at all.  Sometimes he makes vague allusions to staying out all night, hunting through skips in back alleys for random things or breaking into medical offices to use their equipment.
John licks his lips and fights back an annoyed sigh.  He had been hoping that he wouldn’t have to come right out and say it—that he wouldn’t have to admit to cheating on his wife—but it seems that Mike isn’t as keen as John had originally hoped he would be.  “It’s, er…it’s not for her.”  He mumbles the words and fights down a blush that he tells himself is not from shame.  It’s really not.
“Don’t worry.  It took a little finesse, but we were able to take out a couple of the perps, and the others decided that their point had just gotten a whole lot smaller at that moment, so they bolted.  Police officers found them all and brought them in.”
John stares at Sherlock, at a loss.  There are no words.  John can think of nothing that he can say that would make this moment better, nothing that would make Sherlock’s pain go away.
.  He always knows how to set John off, but he always knows exactly what to do to quell John’s anger, too.  It is disconcerting, to say the least.
Crouching there on the floor next to him Sherlock gives a little whimper—the only sound John has heard him make—and leans into John’s side.  “I’m sorry, Daddy.  Are you mad at me?”
Sherlock whimpers at John’s words, wrapping his arms around his thighs and pulling them tighter to his body to give John more access to his hole.
“Look at you, so perfect at taking my fingers.  You take everything I give you so well, Sherlock; you’re such a good boy.  My cock in your mouth and my fingers in your arse.  You take my cock in your arse perfectly, too.  All of it.  Amazing.  So beautiful.”

He shook the small rectangular box, hearing the item shift slightly and heavily against the cardboard.
John takes a deep breath, holding it in and trying to calm himself to keep from rubbing off against Sherlock’s arsehole right there and ending it all.
John has honestly never felt so loved before in his life.  He has never felt so studied, so torn apart by a look yet so understood at the same time.  No one has ever known him like Sherlock does, accepted him—body and mind—like Sherlock has.  No one.
.  Sherlock’s been using that as the excuse to try to get John to play this dangerous little game from the very beginning.  John just huffs out a laugh at Sherlock’s ploy and moves across the room to sit on the edge of Sherlock’s bed, not buying it for a second.  “Go on,” he says, crossing his arms in front of his chest and giving Sherlock a cheeky smile, “tell me what I like about it, then.”  He knows Sherlock loves to show off, loves any reason to deduce John.  And John would be lying if he said that he didn’t like it himself.
When John gets a bluntly worded text from his friend asking to meet him at the pub that afternoon, John knows he is in trouble.  A part of him wants to tell Mike that he is busy, that he can’t make it.  A part of him wants desperately to run away from this and not have to deal with it.
.  “You don’t ever have to be sorry for that, love,” John tells him as he crawls back up the bed and lies next to him, planting soft, wet kisses across Sherlock’s bare shoulders.  “You don’t ever have to be sorry for letting me make you lose control.  It’s lovely and I want it to happen constantly.”
Sherlock huddles into himself in the seat and John can see that his jacket is much too thin for this time of year, aside from being completely soaked through.  John quickly turns on the heat and cranks it all the way up as he notices Sherlock shivering.
John must have ended up making some sort of sound unconsciously, because Sherlock had turned to him suddenly, whipping around and dropping the instrument to his side as if he had been caught doing something naughty.  He hadn’t resumed playing, just as John suspected he would.  He had just stood there, looking at John through wide, unreadable eyes.  John wasn’t going to let him off the hook so easily, though.
Also, on a smaller note, for those of you geeks who would find this interesting, I took the name for the Synathida pill (which restructures the male body, allowing the appendix to become uterine-like and house a fetus) from the scientific name Syngnathidae—the family of fish in which the males carry their offspring through gestation, instead of the female.
Sherlock is panting and boneless as he leans against John, who quickly takes the opportunity to push the brunet up and off of him, sitting him up and putting as much distance as he can between their bodies.  It isn’t much on the short bench seat, truth be told, but it will have to suffice.
He wraps his arms around Sherlock’s slim shoulders and brings Sherlock’s body crashing down on top of him for only a moment before he is rolling over, switching their positions and pinning Sherlock below his more substantial weight, one thigh slipping between Sherlock’s legs and rubbing up against the growing bulge he finds there, never letting their lips break apart.
When John feels that they are wet enough, he immediately withdraws them from Sherlock’s mouth and wastes no time in trailing them across Sherlock’s body, down to his exposed arse.  John presses two fingers immediately inside of Sherlock, and the dilated hole takes them with no resistance.  Sherlock bucks suddenly against the table, cursing at the sudden fullness, and John chuckles darkly at him.
He made his way carefully down the stairs and across the entry way, back towards the bedroom where he curled up on the mattress and laid his head down on the pillow, bending around his belly and wrapping his arms about himself in the chilly dimness of the room, wishing like hell John was lying beside him, keeping him warm and keeping him happy.
John sighs and nods his head, bringing a hand up to pinch the bridge of his nose in exasperation.  “Yeah, Sherlock.  A bit not good.”
John sat down heavily next to Lestrade on the couch, turning towards the detective inspector with a frown on his face.  “What?”
“It’s never bothered you before,” he says, almost as soon as John has finished his previous thought.  “Something’s changed.”  There is a short pause before, “Mary has made some sort of comment about it.”  He says John’s wife’s name like it tastes bad in his mouth.
, he must have pushed this particular item deeper down into the old box in which they keep Sherlock’s things, otherwise John knows the nosey genius’ curiosity would have gotten the better of him and he would have unwrapped the plastic bag to have a peek inside.
His hips stutter and he gives one last shove, buries himself deep inside of Sherlock, where he feels warm and protected and safe.  He can feel his cock twitching as he empties himself inside of the boy, his head dropping down to Sherlock’s because he doesn’t have the strength to hold it up any longer.  John kisses him—deep, languorous kisses—and stays buried inside of him, wishing he never had to leave.
“You know,” John says suddenly, frowning at the child sitting across from him, “I shouldn’t be letting you talk about my wife that way.  In fact, I shouldn’t be talking to you about this stuff at all.”
“God, Sherlock,” John pants, tearing his eyes away from the sight of the plush mouth around him before he comes right then.  He squeezes the base of his cock harder, digging the tips of his fingers under his scrotum for good measure.  He can feel his imminent orgasm recede slightly, but not enough.  “You’re gorgeous, you know that, baby?  Simply gorgeous.”
“Sherlock—?” he starts to ask but the younger male cuts him off with a soft whimper and a harsh clench of his hands on the front of John’s plaid shirt.
He drops his head down to kiss Sherlock softly on the lips, but when their mouths meet he tastes a salty wetness, tangy against his tongue.  He pulls back instantly, worried.
John drags his fingers across the soft, sweat-slick skin and over to Sherlock’s engorged prick.  He takes Sherlock’s shaft in his grip and holds his hand still as he rocks Sherlock’s body back and forth, his thumb dragging along the underside of it and swirling around the tip.
Sherlock looks at him for a moment longer and John thinks he is going to argue with him, but then Sherlock sighs and settles further back against the headboard he is leaning against.  “Fine.  But I have to do something to keep myself entertained,” he complains petulantly as he watches John walk across the room and toss the cigarette in the rubbish bin by Mary’s vanity.
John knows it would be pointless to deny these things, so he goes a different route.  “We’re just friends,” he states plainly; his rehearsed, official party line.  He has been wondering when he was going to first have to use it.
John knows Sherlock depends on him for a lot, but he also knows that Sherlock is one of the most independent, self-sufficient people alive. Who else could have grown up the way he did and not need anyone to look after them?  Who else could have done the things Sherlock had to do to survive his childhood and still come out so magnificent on the other side?
The pill has already proven itself to work wonders for him, but John knows that he isn’t going to last much longer.  The tight heat of Sherlock around him is too much, the indecent noises John is fucking out of him are even more so, and he can feel his orgasm coiling deep in his belly, warming his body and drawing his balls up tight.
They both lie in bed, sweaty and panting and watching each other as the last vestiges of sunlight fade from the room and leave them in darkness.
Sherlock shakes his head, confused as to why John would pull away.  “I should be doing something for you, too,” he says with a winded voice, already out of breath from John’s attentions.
“Keep touching yourself, sweetheart,” John reminds him as he scissors his fingers wider, trying to prepare Sherlock for another soon.  “I want to watch you.”
John knew that Sherlock didn’t put much stock in God.  There was ever only science in his world.  His faith was built on facts, deductions, information, calculations.  There was only that which he could see, touch, feel with his own two hands.  Science and medicine and reason.  So of course the consulting detective had no qualms about taking the pill, Synathida.  Sherlock was a man of experimentation, of gaining first-hand knowledge, of risk for the sake of excitement.
John is so stunned that he doesn’t even notice he is answering.  “Afghanistan,” he chokes out and then seems to remember himself.  “Sorry, how did you know…?”
Mycroft seems to know exactly what John is thinking, but he stands his ground, his smile growing.  “You tell me,” he says, tone insolent.
After only a moment, John is almost there.  He can feel it in the pit of his stomach, a spark igniting and setting his nerves on fire, but he won’t come before Sherlock has.  He is so close, though, that he knows he will have to give Sherlock a little push to get him nearer to the edge, alongside John.
Sherlock looks like he doesn’t exactly know whether to say yes or no to John’s questions.  That’s fine with John, though.  The man is more than happy to put Sherlock in his place.
He slowly begins to feel Sherlock respond against him, moving his own lips in a mimicry of John’s movements.  It is slightly awkward at first, but John presses his mouth a little harder against Sherlock’s and the boy lets out a small, helpless moan.  John is completely lost in the sensation of the brunet’s soft, full lips against his own thinner ones.  They fit together so perfectly that John doesn’t ever want to stop, but he knows that Sherlock must be getting short of breath—if he’s never kissed anyone before then he must not know how to breathe steadily through the nose while snogging.  It is a trick John can’t wait to show him.
When Sherlock finally has him naked, nestled between his pale spread thighs, John wastes no time rubbing dry fingers across the boy’s hole.  He can feel it clench as Sherlock gasps against his mouth and bucks into him, the tight ring of muscle closing up.  Sherlock’s arm shoots out to grab blindly at something on his bedside table, knocking over empty tea cups and boxes of nicotine patches.  He shoves a bottle at John’s chest.
Still holding Sherlock’s hand, John took a tentative step forward and was vaguely surprised when the crowd didn’t close back in around them, attempting to swallow them whole. Instead, a man stepped forward, older and fierce-looking with a full facial beard and long, scraggily hair.
Nervously, John ducked his head and reached out to grab a hold of Sherlock’s hand, walking straight into the heart of the crowd and hoping that this would be over soon. He wanted nothing more than a hot shower and a good cup of tea.
John doesn’t have Sherlock’s class the next day, Wednesday, and he doesn’t try to go over to Sherlock’s house that afternoon, his mind still numb and dazed from everything that happened the day before.  So when Sherlock leaves on Thursday morning, John doesn’t even get the chance to see him one last time.
They’ve come to find that the spankings John administers aren’t really punishment; Sherlock enjoys them.  Hell, who is he kidding—
John doesn’t waste any time sliding down Sherlock’s body, biting teasingly at Sherlock’s nipples and laving them with attention until they are hard peaks straining against the chill of the room, wet and slick from John’s treatment.  He takes one gently in his teeth while he pinches the other between his fingers for only a moment before he can’t wait any longer to have Sherlock in his mouth.  When he gets to Sherlock’s cock, John sees that he is already so stiff that it looks as if he has been hard for hours; his balls are drawn up so tight that they are already hard and red beneath John’s fingers.
John should be mad that Sherlock has used him this way, right now, in this particular situation.  Sherlock knows that John hates when he doesn’t let John care for him the way John wants, or makes John do things that hurt him.  And right now Sherlock was letting John hurt him past the point of pleasure, past the point that his body could take.  Sherlock
John is just about to ask Sherlock what happened, when he sees it—a medical grade scalpel lying on the floor next to Sherlock’s thigh, the blade covered in thick, dark blood.
particular toy store, anyways—which he had serendipitously stumbled upon just the other day.  When he found it, he had been giddy as a child himself to discover not just one gift for Sherlock that he knew the boy would love, but two.
“How can something like that be wrong, John?” Sherlock asks on a whisper, and it sounds almost like he is pleading with the older man.
She pointed to the screen, and to a small, almost bean-shaped figure that could barely be seen through the black and white static lines all around it.
“Don’t even try pretending that you don’t know what I’m talking about,” Mycroft cuts his brother off condescendingly.  “You were always such a horrid liar, even when you were a child.”
him to kiss me.  Anyone else would think that of me.”  His hands fall away from John’s face, leaving them staring at each other.  Sherlock looks down at John with large, unfathomably colourless eyes.  “You’ve thought it before,” he reminds John, implying the incident with Mike at school, his tone only slightly accusing.  “But this time…it didn’t even cross your mind.”
“I don’t expect you to understand, Sherlock.  I—” he stumbles over his words, searching for the right ones, trying to explain himself.  It seems hopeless, though.  How can Sherlock know what it feels like to be beaten down by life, to have so much taken from him?  How can a child like Sherlock understand?  “I’ve lost so much of myself over the past couple of years,” John says, trying not to sound as pathetic as he feels, though he doubts he succeeds.  “All I have left are my morals, and my pride, and my sense of right and wrong.  If I let you take that from me, I’ll have nothing left.”  He takes a shuddering breath as he stands beside the table
John frowned back at the detective inspector, unsure of what Greg was asking him for a moment. “Wha—?”
to be around each other for the rest of the day, and we made everyone around us uncomfortable.  So we had to leave.”  John turns away from him, shutting his eyes tight.  He can’t even look at Sherlock right now, he is so angry.  “Do you know how embarrassing that is, Sherlock, to have her family see us like that?  To have them hear us argue about the things that we do?”
“Yes, Daddy,” Sherlock tells him with an emphatic nod of his head and wide, honest eyes.  “I can be a big boy for you.”
The anesthesiologist made quick work of him, administering his spinal block with fast, concise movements that didn’t seem at all affected by the sudden emergency and time constraints.  Sherlock was grateful, at least, for the swift end to the worst of the pain he was feeling.  As the numbness spread over his lower half, he felt as though he were finally able to breathe again, and only then could he focus enough of his attention on what was going on around him to understand what was happening.
Sherlock kisses him back, opening his mouth to John and letting the man taste him, take him.  Against John’s tongue, he can taste the salt from the stir-fry he cooked for dinner and the smooth, dark sweetness of the chocolate that he had let Sherlock eat for dessert, a delicious combination.
When Sherlock takes too long to answer, John tears his eyes away from the pretty picture of Sherlock’s arse to look at him, turning to find Sherlock staring at him out of red-rimmed, wet eyes.  His cheeks are tracked with tears and the tip of his nose is as rosy as his bum, but the glare he is shooting John is all child-like petulance.
Thankfully Lestrade was too busy making phone calls to have a quiet, uncomfortable moment alone with Sherlock, which the brunette man was eternally grateful for, even as he panted in pain and fever in the front seat, gripping onto the insides of the car and bracing himself as Lestrade took turns too fast and the nausea roiled inside of his stomach disturbingly.
He never thought that he would end up a disabled war veteran with a medical degree, teaching advanced biology at a fucking secondary school.
John gave him a reassuring smile and reached a hand out to stoke Callum’s cheek softly while Sherlock still held him.  “The doctors want him to gain a bit more weight, and eat better,” John replied.  “He can’t take more than 2 ounces at a time right now.  But he’s getting better.  Once he gains a pound or so they say he can go home.”
Sherlock had never been a neat man.  His genius wouldn’t allow it.  Who had time for picking up after oneself when there were theories to be proven, codes to be cracked, problems to be solved?  All of the strange props he used for cases usually got dropped wherever was most convenient when he managed to finally get home after a case, and books, notepads, and loose sheets of paper generally covered every square inch of desk space, floor space and even the walls.  It was something John had grown accustomed to—over a long period of time—but Mycroft seemed adamant that his home not be treated as another Baker Street.
to a pack?!  You’re sixteen years old!” he shouts, forgetting for the moment that they are in a public place.  Though “public” is a loose term.  Their meetings have been getting progressively later and later, and at this time of night no one is around to give them curious looks.
Sherlock moans and dips his tongue into John’s mouth in response, as if he’s trying to taste John’s words.
Sherlock held in a sigh by the thinnest of threads.  “I don’t need a lecture on carrying a concealed weapon without a permit, Lestrade.  I know very well that you were in the right.”  The words left his mouth bitterly, but he knew they were the truth.
“How are things with the missus?” Mike asks when he finally shows up, throwing himself down into a bar stool next to John with a sigh and motioning to the bartender with one hand.  Mike comes here so often that the wizened man behind the counter doesn’t even have to ask what he drinks.  Just pours it and slides it along the bar top to Mike.
Unable to wait much longer, John adds another finger quickly and Sherlock groans at the stretch of it.  His body gives out completely from under him and his chest falls the rest of the way onto the wood.  John uses the opportunity of sudden compliance to finish prepping him swiftly, scissoring and stretching him widely before adding a third finger.  Sherlock gasps at the last addition, and his body must still be screaming that it is close to its limit, just like yesterday.  John isn’t too worried, though—they will have plenty of time to get Sherlock accustomed to taking more in the future.
Sherlock tried to keep his composure, but Lestrade’s choice of words was unfortunate and had him snapping out a retort, suddenly incensed and short-tempered.
He’s made a mess out of Sherlock already.  His glass-green eyes have watered from the pressure John is exerting on him and reflexive tears are streaming down his face, tracking his cheeks and meeting with the spit that is running down his chin.  Sherlock’s cheeks are a deep, blotchy red from the lack of air and his hands are shaking as they rest on John’s thighs, the fingers clenching sporadically.  In between his legs, Sherlock’s prick is still hard, the slender length of it jutting out.  John can see that Sherlock has dripped a small puddle of precome onto the carpet beneath his knees.  John’s cock twitches at the sight below him, and he grabs hold of his prick to rub the head softly along the closed seam of Sherlock’s mouth.
He pushed in slowly, carefully, enjoying the warm, tight heat of Sherlock’s body and trying not to hurt him.  It was still a bit of a stretch he knew, even with three fingers of preparation, but hopefully Sherlock was loose enough to not feel too much pain.
John has never really stopped to think too long on the fact that he is cheating on Mary.  It is just something that simply doesn’t cross his mind when he is with Sherlock, happy and carefree.  Sherlock fills up John’s heart and his mind and his life in such a way that John forgets completely that what he and his student are doing is highly inappropriate and immoral.  When John is with Sherlock, he sees the world for what it could be, not what it is, and it feels more like he is cheating on Sherlock with his wife than the other way around.
Sherlock does nothing but stare at him blankly for a long moment, curly hair unmanageably mussed from sleep.  He must have drifted off as soon as John left.  If Sherlock is surprised at John’s question he doesn’t show any sign of it at all, only wide eyes and an unblinking stare.
John figures that he needs to text him back as quickly as possible so that the boy doesn’t have a nervous breakdown.
“I don’t know what to tell you, Mary,” he says to her, voice tight and low.  His composure is hanging on by a thread and he doesn’t know what he will do if he is pushed any farther today.  “If you’re not going to believe me, then I don’t know what else to say.”
John pushes against Sherlock again, shoving him into the table.  Without warning, John’s hands move down to grip Sherlock’s arse and lift him slightly so that he is suddenly sitting on the flat wooden surface of the table top.  The height difference forces John to tilt his head up farther in order to continue kissing Sherlock, and he brings his hands around to the grip Sherlock’s thighs.  John pushes Sherlock’s legs apart widely so that he can insinuate himself between them, then pulls Sherlock’s hips against his own roughly.
No news reporter worth his salt would want to publish a story—especially such a juicy one—with only a few small facts, and, since he and John certainly weren’t confirming, denying, or granting interviews with anyone, aside from a small handful of medical specialists, there was no hard evidence to keep the story going.
And in his post-orgasmic daze, Sherlock could feel John’s thrusts getting harder, feel John’s fingers tighten on his hips until it almost hurt, feel John’s breath catch as he climaxed inside of Sherlock, making a mess out of him.
Warnings: Erm, there’s some hardcore face fucking at the beginning of this chapter.  Like, literal face fucking.  I regret nothing…
John realises that they have been sitting in the loo for quite some time now with only silence around them, so he clears his throat a little awkwardly, licking his lips.  “Do you like it, kitten?” he asks, trying not to sound nervous.  But, really, he doesn’t think it will ever stop being nerve wracking to put himself out there in such an embarrassing way, with the possibility of being rejected always in the forefront of his mind.
That is why he is here in this mediocre town, after all; where he is too far away from London for the steady, fast-pace lifestyle he is used to but close enough for weekend visits.  A fresh start—that is what he had asked Mary for.  A new life for them.  If they moved away from her job, her so-called “friends”, and all of the men she slept with on a regular basis, John had promised her that their lives would be better.
And he understood suddenly, why John was so tired of this.  Sherlock realized in that moment, just how much weight he had put onto John’s shoulders.  Weeks, months, even years, he had been piling more and more onto John, had been doing so ever since they had first met, and Sherlock was finally beginning to understand that all of those things people had been saying about him being selfish—John, Lestrade, Mycroft—well, maybe they were true after all.
“Please, John, please,” he begs, the words spilling out of his mouth of their own accord on tiny little helpless sobs.
It is late by the time he decides to head back home.  He doesn’t usually stay out ‘til this hour but he also usually runs into Sherlock earlier, so it’s understandable.  He is getting ready to leave, gathering up his rubbish and his cane, when the door opens once more and Sherlock walks in, scowl on his face and seeming to be in a terrible mood.
For the first time since he has moved to this city, John leaves school as soon as the bell rings for the end of the day.  He doesn’t want to stay around there for a second longer—he feels as though every teacher he sees can tell what he is guilty of.  It means he will have to spend more time ignoring Mary at home, but he thinks that is a fair trade-off if he doesn’t have to feel this overwhelming sense of paranoia any longer.
John hates that he has to ask, but he knows that he needs to.  He has seen his fair share of addicts come through hospitals where he has worked, and he recognises that twitchy, edgy look with a sinking feeling.  “Are you using again?” John asks, and his voice and the look he gives Sherlock are both stern and hard, trying to cover up the fear he feels.
He felt decidedly self-conscious about the whole thing, gripping the ends of his shirt together in clenched hands and refusing to meet John’s eyes as the blonde man stared at him incredulously.
Sherlock simply chuckles at his impatience.  “I’m fine.  I promise.  Everything is sorted.  You don’t have to worry so much.”
With a resigned sigh, he walked over to the door and buzzed.  The detective answered after only a minute.
There is Sherlock Holmes, sitting on his couch next to his wife.  They are talking animatedly to each other in soft tones and sharing a cup of tea.
Just as he suspected, Sherlock crinkles his nose in mock-disgust, but his blush only deepens and John chuckles softly.  Sherlock, though, can’t seem to stop worrying.
“But it’s highly improbable!” Sherlock burst out, his agitation ruffling his calm demeanor.  “Scientifically implausible, John.  You can’t possibly think that what you’re saying is true.”  He huffed in annoyance and John had to fight back a laugh.  “To claim that your penis has some sort of magical, problem-solving capabilities is ridiculous.”
Anderson had wanted to press charges, of course, and John had complained that that was the last thing he and Sherlock needed, for the press to get wind of Sherlock’s anger and aggression and turn the whole thing into another spectacle. Lestrade had had to be called in as a mediator, like a head-teacher trying to get two school children to play nicely with each other, and it was agreed that Sherlock would acquiesce to the charges brought up against him as long as no more information was leaked to the newspapers about Sherlock’s condition, or what went on in his life. A rather anti-climactic end to the whole ordeal, but one that seemed to make John content, though he was still upset about the whole situation in the first place, and when everything was squared away, he imperiously told Sherlock that he was going out to the pub with Lestrade for a bit, and that Sherlock shouldn’t expect him home any time soon.
Yes, that seems fair, he decides as he moves down to kneel on the ground by John’s feet and hastily opens up his trousers, pushing his khaki’s and pants halfway down his thighs.  Sherlock can watch while Greg makes love to his husband, while Greg takes John the way that
It is the first time that the name has been said, the first time that John has said it in regards to himself, the first time that John has
He opened his eyes and looked down the length of his body, unable to control the loud moan that tore from his throat at the sight that met his eyes. Sherlock was moving desperately over him, rocking his hips with an abandon that John had rarely seen in him. His own cock was stiff and leaking precum in sticky globs that ran down the underside of his dick as it jutted out from his body, and his belly seemed so round from John’s point of view, large and delicate, and John couldn’t seem to take his eyes off of it.
anything had ended in him standing on the rooftop of St. Bart’s hospital, looking down at John while the blonde man stared up at him, watching him as he—
been months since they had last had sex) but Sherlock didn’t seem to be as worried about it as John was, growling frustratingly at John’s languid movements and urging him on.
“Remember what I said, John,” Sherlock murmurs as he heaves himself off of John’s back and struggles to disengage from John’s body.  “Clench now.  There’s a good boy.”
His cheek still stings sharply from where Mary slapped him.  That had been the end of it.  He had looked at her in shock for a second before turning right around and leaving the room, making up the spare bedroom so that he could spend the night away from her.  They were hardly ever physical in their fights, and whenever they were, it was usually inanimate objects that got the brunt of their anger.  Pictures and certain prized possessions.  A few times Mary would stoop to throwing something in John’s general direction—sometimes hitting him with it but mostly not—but they had never raised their hands to one another.
Large, warm hands suddenly envelope John’s own as they cradle Sherlock’s face softly, and he can feel long probing fingers go immediately to his left ring finger, caressing the indented, untanned skin that is now bare.
“Ngh,” Sherlock gasps out, head jerking up from where it is lying on top of the pillows, the noise sounding strange and inhuman.
“So, then, what are you doing here, of all places?” John interjected, not liking the growing tension that was settling in his living room as Sherlock and McNairn continued to stare at one another, sizing each other up.
Sherlock cringed inwardly.  He was beginning to feel like some sort of laboratory rat, being poked and prodded and told when to sit, when to stand, when to cough, when to lie down, when to urinate.
The pain started a few hours in to the case.  Sherlock had just gotten permission from Mrs. Holloway to exhume her dead husband’s remains, and almost didn’t notice the dull throbbing near his navel and in his upper abdomen.  It wasn’t until it began to work its way down to his right side and become a bit sharper that it caught enough of his attention to warrant a moment of his time.
And he did, when he at last opened the door and saw John standing on his front step, hands in his pockets to keep them warm and the tip of his nose red from the cold and the tears.
“Everyone’s in the drawing room,” John said as he helped Sherlock down the stairs.  The brunette’s stomach protruded so far out that he could no longer see his feet anymore, and the stairs of Mycroft’s home were always taken with great care.
But he couldn’t kid himself into thinking that he felt better now that everything was out in the open.
John stood, in stunned silence, for only a moment more before the chill of the room became too much for him and he turned finally to stomp out of Sherlock’s bedroom, slamming the door in a snit behind him.
Sherlock picks the chain up lightly and makes the silver clink together with a small tinkling sound as he closes his hand around the disks.  “I’ll take care of them and make sure they stay beautiful,” Sherlock promises him, bringing his closed fist to his chest and resting it there, holding the cradled dog tags against his heart.
,” she said happily. John noticed a name tag above her right breast and his eyes trailed appreciatively along the unbuttoned top of her shirt for a moment. “My name is Bridget. Can I help you find anything?”
He grabs his own bath sponge from the side of the tub and wets Sherlock down before he pours a dollop of his body wash onto it, working the gel into a foamy lather and pressing it into the skin at Sherlock’s neck, planning to start from the top and work his way down.  He spends a little more time than is necessary working the soap into the delicate skin at the juncture of Sherlock’s neck and shoulder, because it is John’s favourite place to press his face to.  He loves it most when Sherlock smells like him.  It reminds John of the times they get to spend together, so few and far between, with real life separating them.  When he is satisfied with how clean Sherlock’s neck and shoulders are, John slowly works his way down the length of one arm with the sponge.  He scrubs with delicate, surgical precision at Sherlock’s hands, taking deliberate care with each of his fingers before slowly lowering Sherlock’s arm gently back into the water and starting on the second one, giving it the same treatment.
Sherlock lets out a derisive laugh that sounds nothing like the ones Mary aims at him when John has said something particularly dense.  He finds that he likes the sound of it coming out of Sherlock’s mouth.  “Mr. Watson, I have a genius level IQ.  Do you not think I know that smoking is ‘unhealthy’?”  He’s smirking at John again, those full lips twisted beautifully, and the action looks so natural on Sherlock; it is like he spends his days sneering at those of lesser intellect than he.  John thinks that might just be true.
“Do you want me to fuck you again, Sherlock?” he asks, dropping his head to suck a love bite into the soft flesh at the top of Sherlock’s thigh.
“Does it feel better now, baby?” John asks him with a soft smile, looking up at the grinning face of his lover.  “Doesn’t hurt anymore?”  He ignores the burning, aching press of his own erection inside his trousers in favour of watching Sherlock smile sleepily and wiggle sluggishly beneath John’s hands as he drags them up and down the silky-smoothness of an ever-so-slightly rounded tummy, dipping under Sherlock’s shirt to feel the soft skin.
that!” he hisses once again, heart thudding in his chest once he realises the severity of their situation and just what exactly it is that the boy wants to do.  “My wife is asleep right down the hall!”
It was only after a few seconds had passed that Sherlock realized that Lestrade had been talking to him.
“No, Sherlock,” John cut him off, trying his hardest to stay calm and keep his voice steady, but Sherlock had always been able to read John like a book, drugged or not.  The deep frown lines in John’s forehead were still there, and the tears in his eyes couldn’t lie, no matter what the sound of his voice said.  “Everything is fine.  Everything will be fine.  You’ve nothing to be scared of.  I’m here.  I’ll be here with you the whole time.  We’ll get through this together.  I…I love you.”
?” he begs petulantly when John doesn’t answer him, sounding for all the world like the child he tries so hard not to be.
Baker Street looked very much the same as it always had from the outside.  To passersby, it could not be gleaned that the building had been almost destroyed, burnt down to its bare bones, torn apart by radicals and terrorists.
Sherlock still tastes minty from his toothpaste but underneath it is a flavour that is all him, something soft and subtle that tastes like warm flesh.  John dips his tongue into Sherlock’s mouth to taste more of it.  He brings his hands up to cup the sides of Sherlock’s face so that he can’t move away, even though he knows Sherlock isn’t going anywhere.  He falls into John, against the man’s chest, opening his mouth and meeting John’s tongue with his own, and their kiss becomes wet and slick and desperate.
Beside him Mike huffs out a small laugh.  “It’s nothing serious, really.  It’s just, there’s this kid that goes to school here—his name is Holmes—and he’s, well…he’s something else.”
It was all taking rather a lot to get used to, and Sherlock was finding that his patience for all of it was wearing thin.
“Yeah,” John said, rummaging through the other parts of the crib that littered the floor. “That’s what’s doing it. My
“Sherlock,” John says with a hint of warning in his voice as he moves his face away from Sherlock’s advances.  Sherlock needs to learn that he shouldn’t be the one giving out orders.
There is the cold, clinical feel of medical-grade steel beneath him, inside of him, piercing him, and the even colder stare of the woman he had loved afterwards, disappointment and disgust so searing that he sometimes wishes he had died on that operating table.
know better; he knows that when it comes to matters of the body such as this, Sherlock is very much like a child, unknowing and very willing to gather new information.
Then, slowly, John feels Sherlock’s hand grip his own back.  His hold is cautious and he fumbles with John’s hand as he tries to find the best way to hold it.  There is a moment where their fingers dance around each other’s before Sherlock finds a position that feels right to him.  John patiently waits for him to get comfortable with what is happening.
By the time he gets back home late Monday afternoon, John is tired.  He hadn’t slept well the remainder of the weekend and he has been on edge ever since the whole incident with Sherlock took place.  He hasn’t had a drink in days, not wanting to set up camp in the hotel bar around his coworkers while on a trip for his job, and he wants a pint in the worst way.  As he pulls up to the drive in front of his house, he lets out a sigh of relief.  His thoughts are filled with the nice, long shower that awaits him and the comfy bed that he can fall into.  The reprieve is short lived, though, when he remembers the talk that he needs to have with Sherlock.
“You did?” Sherlock asks him after a moment, deducing silently that John isn’t playing some sort of trick on him.
John sighed and tried a different tactic, laying down Sherlock’s book on the side table next to the wing backed chair by the fire and softening his tone.  “Sherlock, these people want to do something nice for you—it wasn’t my idea.”  He walked over to where the other man was standing, in one corner of the library as he skimmed slowly over the spines of the leatherbound books, long fingers delicately tracing names.
,” Sherlock stresses the word, as if that will make John feel any better about the situation, “then I won’t bring it up again.  I promise.  Just, please, can we at least discuss it?”
.”  With his mouth pressed this close to Sherlock’s body, he can smell the alcohol on his own breath and he cringes when he wonders if Sherlock will think he is drunk.  Sherlock makes no mention of it, though, and John forgets about it in the next moment.
However, John ignores the blatant display that Sherlock is putting on and instead decides to go about this slowly.  “Let’s get these off, yeah?” he asks innocently as he fumbles about with the flies.
Otherwise, it surprises John how easily they fall into a routine in London: Sherlock prepares himself for university while John finds work at a surgery.  It feels right, simple, as if they should have been doing this all along.  There is none of the discomfort that John had feared Sherlock might experience, being in an unfamiliar city, living with his first serious relationship at such a young age, so soon after meeting each other.  In fact, Sherlock seems to be more surprised that this is all actually happening in the first place and that it isn’t some cruel dream, meant to tease or torment him.  John has caught Sherlock on several nights staring at him from one of the mismatched chairs that Mrs. Hudson had left in the sitting room (the leather one which Sherlock had commandeered for his own), watching as John cooks dinner or putters around cleaning or doing some other utterly domestic chore.  The look on his face tells John that he is silently wishing very hard that all of this won’t just disappear come morning.  At moments like these, John usually ends up dropping whatever he is doing and going over to kiss the young man, soft and full of promise, telling him without words that he isn’t going anywhere.  Silently telling him that this is, indeed, very real.
“I’m very upset with you,” John says softly, and he lets his disappointment tinge his voice.  “What you did was stupid and reckless and immature.  So immature.”  He shakes his head, not looking at Sherlock any longer.  “I’m disappointed in you, Sherlock.  I had hoped that you would respect my boundaries and not do anything else to make me uncomfortable, but if I can’t trust you then I have to stop this—” he is going to say relationship but catches himself just in time “—
“Oh,” is all John can think to say, his stomach twisting worryingly.  He honestly hasn’t realised he has been calling Sherlock anything, the diminutives seeming to slip out of his mouth of their own accord, naturally.  He worries that he has offended Sherlock, made him feel demeaned or objectified without attempting to.  John has always been rather vocal and sentimental when it comes to relationships, always enjoying the physical and emotional representation that someone was his.  He’s never really had to censor himself when it comes to his relationships with other people and he’s rather new at all of this.  (Of course, he’s never been with anyone as tetchy as Sherlock, either.)  He guesses he’s just been doing a shit job of it.  “Er, do you want me to stop?” he asks quietly, awkwardly, because he doesn’t know what else to say, mostly.
When he looked over at John, he saw that the other man was just an entranced by the simple movement as he was.
“How ‘bout a wank, then?” he asked huskily, as he rolled carefully on to his side and reached out towards John, pulling the other man to him until John was on his side, too, and they were facing each other on the bed.
“I’ve been selfish,” Sherlock tells him, voice honest and deep and sorrowful in the stillness that has settled between them.  “I realise that now.  I’ve been so selfish, and that’s not how you’re supposed to treat someone you love.  That just makes me no better than your wife.  Maybe…maybe I should finally stop hurting you,” he says with another shrug of his shoulders and a shake of his head.  “Maybe without me in your life, you can go back to the way things were before; you can fix your marriage and you can have a house in a nice quiet neighbourhood with a dog and a family.  Maybe you can try to make everything better again.”
“I want to watch you when you come,” John says, staring down at him.  “Fuck, I want you on your back and I want to see you come all over yourself for me.”
“You and your sodding leg, John,” she says with a roll of her eyes.  “You didn’t even get shot there—I don’t understand why you complain about it so bloody much.”
When Sherlock finally grows impatient, he pulls his fingers out of John without warning, and the feeling is odd—it always is, John thinks with a grimace—but he doesn’t complain because he knows that he will be filled again shortly, and he shivers in anticipation.
had become the medical marvel now. Between one breath and the next, in the span of a handful of pills, he had made himself Britain’s greatest science experiment, a lab rat that was being watched and written about and tested on.
“John,” he hears Sherlock say from somewhere below him, but he ignores it.  He can’t take his eyes off of this part of Sherlock that he has never seen before.  There is the finest dusting of hair leading from the tops of Sherlock’s thighs and his perineum up to his arsehole.  The hairs are so thin that they are mostly translucent, almost non-existent, and John can only see them when the light hits Sherlock’s body just right, spread open as he is right now.
“Forever,” John responds instantly.  He doesn’t want to move, but he knows that he should dig through his discarded clothes for his phone, so that he can send another pitiful excuse to Mary as to why he isn’t home.  He clambers off of the bed and paws at his clothes until he finds his mobile, then he crawls back over to Sherlock, cuddling him tight.  Over Sherlock’s head, John sends off some lame excuse about a guy’s night out with Mike, and how she shouldn’t wait up for him to come home because he will be late.  Then he turns his ringer off and tosses his phone to the edge of the bed, already forgotten in favour of the feel and smell of Sherlock around him.  He has no intention of going home tonight, and he only hopes that Mary will fall asleep early, so that he can he can tell her he stumbled in late and left for work early the next morning.
“‘I cannot have sweets unless I eat real food’,” John continues, and now he knows he may be pushing his luck, especially since he is now making rules that he wants to carry over into their everyday lives.  And, just as he expected—
Sherlock has already come once this afternoon, but John will bet good money that he can make the Sherlock climax again.  John probably wouldn’t even break a sweat doing it.  He absolutely loves that Sherlock’s body is on a hair-string trigger whenever John touches him.
“Isn’t it obvious?” John asks, giving him a little smile.  “This is still part of taking care of you, teaching you right from wrong.  There’s no doubt in my mind that I will enjoy this.”
Unsurprisingly, Greg takes John’s chin lightly in his fingers and tilts John’s face up so that he can see it better.  When he sees Greg’s mouth set in an unhappy line, John knows exactly what his husband is looking at.
Stunned at the other man’s forwardness, John didn’t know what to say. He stood there for a moment, after Lestrade’s hand had dropped back down to his side, and simply stared at the other man. Thankfully he was saved from having to respond by Sherlock’s voice, close to them, calling out, “Ready, John?”
“Fine.”  If that was the case, then there was a very simple solution.  “Watson Holmes, then,” he said simply.
As they settle against one another, John takes the bottle of lotion and squeezes a generous dollop of the cool moisturiser out into his empty palm and then reaches down between their bodies, finding Sherlock’s thighs and pressing his fingers in between them, lifting his top leg up slightly.  Sherlock tries to look back at him in confusion but John shushes him quickly and turns his hand over to rub the lotion on the skin at the inside of each of Sherlock’s thighs; first one leg, then the other.
Sherlock’s own head shook in response to John’s statement.  “Not going to happen,” he said, voice hard and uncompromising.
But the troubles from that morning did not want to stop at just jelly. No, they wanted to encompass all pleasant moments in John’s life.
John smiles down at him, a sadness still pulling at the edge of his lips.  He’ll do anything for Sherlock, though, and if Sherlock wants a cup of tea to make him feel better, then John will spend the rest of his life making him pot after pot with as much sugar as he can possibly heap in it, and bringing Sherlock steaming cups of the sweet drink along with biscuits in bed.
By the time John pulls away they are both panting and John’s cock is trying to stir futilely to attention once more.  Sherlock’s head stays twisted at what must be an uncomfortable angle as he continues to stare wide-eyed at John through the shadows of the room.  John isn’t sure but Sherlock looks slightly surprised.
And John knew he was in trouble then.  Sherlock had never put much stock in God, but the words that had just fallen from his lips sounded dangerously like a prayer.
There isn’t very much left after his first orgasm and John swallows it all down, the mere taste of Sherlock on his tongue enough to send him over the edge finally.  He thrusts into Sherlock’s fist as the other male lies unmoving on top of him.  John’s orgasm rushes through him, setting his whole body alight and making his skin tingle.  He had been so hard that the contractions of his muscles as he climaxes send waves of relief over him and he gasps around his mouthful of Sherlock as he rides the crest of his orgasm.
“John, don’t be rude!” he hears Mary shout from behind him, her voice tinged with shock at seeing him treat a child—one of his pupils—this way.  “He needs your help with something!”
And with that softly spoken, slightly broken plea, John fell off of the edge, shooting out all over his hand and the trousers he hadn’t even bothered to take off completely.
John doesn’t really know what to say to that so he stretches out to kiss Sherlock sadly, and it feels like an apology.  He sits up on the edge of the bed and bends down to the floor to pick up his trousers and pants.  “I’ll come round earlier tomorrow, since I won’t be able to stay too late.  I have dinner plans with Mary.”
“Sherlock,” he says warningly, “Daddy thinks you need a nap, so you’re going to get a nap.  Don’t argue with me, young man.”  He reaches down to pull the tall child up to stand along with him and Sherlock lets him, though once he is beside John he tries to wiggle out of the hold the man has on his arms.  John lets him do as he pleases, instead moving his hands along Sherlock’s back.  He gently pushes the scowling brunet towards the stairs that lead up to John’s bedroom, intent on putting Sherlock to sleep.
They kissed each other tentatively at first, unsure of one another.  In Sherlock’s bedroom, with only the moonlight shining through the open window to see by, John’s hands stuttered their way over Sherlock’s body, uncertain of where to be in the beginning.  But as they continued on, John found that it became easier, nicer, better.
has never paid any attention to me beyond what’s relevant to secure his next position in the government,” Sherlock hisses at John, and when he says the word “brother” he spits it out like it is poison.  “If there are a few hits of cocaine, then I must be a full blown addict; if there is a misunderstanding with a married man then I must be a slag; if there is an assault on me by an older man then I must have brought it on myself.”
“We will call you as soon as we get the test results back, but, if you are pregnant, you may develop more symptoms before you even hear back from us.  Your…breasts…” he said, looking sheepish and slightly uncomfortable for the first time since he had seen Sherlock, “male as they may be, will become tingly, sore, and feel a little swollen, as your male body struggles with the fact that you do not have the necessary mammary glands that the hormones are meant to stimulate, thanks to the progesterone and estrogen coursing through your system.  Also, another symptom that may come up is frequent urination.  The pregnancy hormone hCG will increase the blood flow to your pelvic area and your kidneys, making them more efficient during pregnancy, since you will be urinating for two.”  He stood, signaling the end of Sherlock’s appointment, and the tall brunette moved to do the same, hitting his head on the overhanging light fixture above the exam bed with a hollow-sounding
Nothing in his life, John realises with sudden clarity, has ever felt as good or as right as Sherlock does in his arms.  Nothing has felt as terrifying, either.  Not war, not being shot, not thinking he was going to die.
He pulls Sherlock into his lap, spreading Sherlock’s feet wide on either side of his hips.  He slips a hand, fingers slick with lube, down under the boy’s arse, dragging his digits along the exposed cleft between Sherlock’s cheeks.  Sherlock squirms at the sensation of the smooth coolness and clutches at John’s shoulders, but otherwise he doesn’t say anything.  He waits patiently as John circles his rim, slipping a finger inside of him and wetting him, quickly stretching his hole enough for a second.
“Is that so?” Sherlock asks him, voice irritatingly mocking from the other side of the door.  “Because it seems to me that a reasonable person would have remembered that there are two doors to this bedroom and used the other one by now, instead of wasting time trying to get into one which is clearly not going to open for him any time soon.”
But the detective inspector stood in his doorway, dark eyes serious and solemn under his salt and pepper hair as he waited for Sherlock to come to him, standing aside in the doorway and pointing into his office as invitation for Sherlock to come in and sit down.
So the pregnant man thought he should help him understand.  “You’re feelings for him,” he stated plainly, as if talking to a moron.
Now John can barely keep in the chuckle that tries to burst through his lips.  “Are you sure these rules are meant for me?” he asks rhetorically, already knowing the answer.
“You expect me to be there for you,” he said to Sherlock, voice quivering, “to tell you everything is going to be fine and to make it all better for you.  But you don’t give me anything in return, Sherlock.  You look to me for help but as soon as things are better you’re off again,” he motioned out the window of the room, to the busy street below them, to the darkness of the city all around them, and Sherlock could feel the pull for the need of another case even as he stood there, his heart breaking, because it was an addiction, after all—
friends!” he spits out, face red with anger.  “And when Mary pisses you off tonight, don’t come crawling to me, wanting me to make it better with a shag, since that’s all I’m good to you for!”
for a second so that he could wrap his mind around the blonde man’s previous words and everything that was happening.
If he wanted to never disappoint his child, then somebody was going to have to tell him what to do, because he was at a loss.
“Sorry, sir,” John suddenly heard someone call out to him, tapping him on the shoulder.  “But you can’t stand here.  I’m gonna have to ask you to step across the street.”
John opened his mouth to issue his own retort but thought better of it—it had been too long of a day and he just wanted to sit back and relax…as well as he could.
“I took a cab,” John answered him, not even sure what he was saying at the moment.  He was too busy staring all around him, at everything surrounding him.
Sherlock’s mouth was tentative at first, his tongue flashing out to lick at the head softly a few times before taking just the tip into his mouth, his tongue pushing out to sweep along the sensitive underside and a little farther down the shaft.  John groaned at the feel of it, at the hesitance and uncertainty he could feel in Sherlock’s mouth, so unlike the man’s usual, self-assured demeanor.
John hasn’t even been gone a day and Sherlock hasn’t stopped texting him.  In fact, he has just barely made it in to the hotel where the workshop is being held.  He will be sharing a room with Mike for the weekend so he lets his friend check them in at the front desk while he types out a text to Sherlock.
His mind plays back the row he had with Mary before storming out, the things she said to him, and he can’t stop them from ringing in his ears, no matter how much he tries to block them out, no matter how much whisky he tries to drown them under.
“John, you can’t put forth a statement like that and not expect me to want to subject it to rigorous scientific testing,” Sherlock told him, and how was it possible that he was making it out to sound like this was John’s own fault?  “How else will we ever prove if you’re right or not?”
He just hopes that the shouts from across the house and the pained cries from Sherlock’s father as John beats the man don’t worry the boy too much.
“Beautiful,” Sherlock responds, and then John feels him drape his long, lean body over John’s back.  Mercifully, Sherlock’s hand leaves John’s cock and trails slowly up John’s stomach, over his chest, across his neck, leaving a shiny, slick trail of come in its wake.  It keeps going until it finds John’s hands, still tied together tightly.  From his position, all John has to do is lift his head slightly and he can see Sherlock’s hand, still dripping with John’s release, as Sherlock twines their fingers together, his left hand with John’s left hand.
“W-wha—” he tries to get the word out, but it sticks to his throat, won’t budge, chokes him.  He licks his lips and tries again.  “What are you saying?”
“John?” he suddenly hears Mary’s voice ask from just on the other side of the bathroom door.  “John, are you all right in there?  You’re making strange noises.”
He hopes this isn’t the case, though.  He rather likes calling his lovers pet names, doting on them and making them feel special through something that’s shared only between the two of them, like a special pet name or an inside joke, and he hasn’t been able to do that with Mary in years.  He hasn’t
Even now, after their long day at Scotland Yard and their tiring shopping expedition, John was taking them to a vegan restaurant for lunch.
John sits there on the edge of Sherlock’s bed with his lanky lover in his lap on top of him, stock still, while Sherlock recovers from his orgasm slowly and he tries not to think about what just happened.
“I love you, too,” he answers with a small smile, leaning forward until their foreheads touch.  “Git.”
“Take it,” John tells him, staring up at Sherlock, mesmerised by the way the plump flesh of his bottom lip has turned white from the pressure of his teeth on it.  “Show me that you can take it, like a good boy.  I know you can.  You want to be good for me, don’t you?”  He asks as he fucks up into Sherlock harder, making the teen cry out, shoving himself in deeper.  Sherlock takes him all the way in.  “Yes, just like that,” John croons, running his hands up and down Sherlock’s sweat slicked sides.  “There's my good boy.”
“Stay,” he says to John, and it sounds so imperious that John can’t help but frown at him, mouth setting into a hard, thin line.  Sherlock seems to realise this and so he repeats, softer, “Please, will you stay?”
Sherlock seemed unable to take his eyes away from it.  Even when he spoke his gaze was on it, as if he was talking to John’s dick and not the man himself.  “At least now I know why you think it’s so bloody special.”
“That’s not true!” Sherlock argues, voice loud as he looks at John with panic and no small amount of anger clearly writ on his face now.  “My mental capacity is not diminished when we—”
On a few occasions, Sherlock was even able to forget that he was supposed to be shagging John in the name of science.  During those times, the consulting detective was more than happy to have another go for the second time that day, this time just for himself.
“That’s okay if you don’t want one, I don’t mind sharing mine,” Sherlock says lightly as he moves to get up out of the bed.
“About that,” John stammered, looking away from Sherlock suddenly.  “I was feeling a bit pressured to name him, and I…I’m sorry, Sherlock.”
“Did you think you were the first?  Is that what he told you?” Mycroft asks him, voice genuinely curious.  There is a small, worried frown gracing his broad forehead, so different from Sherlock’s own.  “Like I said, he has always been partial to lying, among a multitude of other sins.  Lust being one of them.”
“So,” John said, clearing his throat and moving off of the armrest, heading back towards Sherlock’s chair.  When he sat down on it, he stayed on the very edge of the seat, not reclining back into the uncomfortable cushions.  He would have to remember to throw out the couch as soon as he could.  “Now that we know the sex, should we begin discussing names?”
John trembles in Sherlock’s arms and thinks about Mary and how she turns away from him during times like this.  Then he thinks about Sherlock and how the teen is holding him so close, stroking his hands soothingly up and down John’s back and whispering softly to him in the dark, letting him know everything is going to be okay.  He thinks about how he tries to be stoic after a nightmare so that he doesn’t disturb Mary sleeping next to him.  He thinks about how scared he is every time—every single fucking time—and how he has to lie in his bed alone and in the dark and do nothing but breathe through his terror and try his hardest not to fall apart.
A week passes by, dreary and wet.  He and Mary barely speak at all during that time and so they hardly fight.  John has not gone back to the coffee shop where he ran into Sherlock.  For his part, the dark-haired boy mostly just sits quietly in the back of his class, not speaking to anyone and—John thinks—not even paying attention to the lessons.  As usual, though, when homework or exams are turned in Sherlock always gets perfect marks, and seems to devour all of the extra material that John gives him.
After everything that has happened over the past several days, they slip easily into one another and it feels right, like missing pieces of a puzzle finally coming together.  Like shelter and comfort and belonging.  He feels whole again, he feels complete.  John would do anything to keep Sherlock here with him like this, safe under him and tight around him.
“Yes, the trust fund,” Sherlock repeated.  “To become accessible to every Holmes once an heir has been conceived.”  He rubbed a hand over his large belly, looking around him to check the work that had been done in this ‘room’.  “How did you expect we were going to feed the child?” he asked, not looking at John but instead holding both of his hands up, making a half of a square with his index fingers and thumbs in ‘L’ shapes, closing one eye and visualizing something unknown as he held his hands up against one of the unfinished walls.  “You know all of my salary and yours goes towards my wardrobe and science equipment.  Did you never wonder how we would support your baby?”
as Sherlock lands on him before rolling off to the side, hands still clutching his bear and bringing it to rest between them as he settles in next to John, his curly head rolling onto John’s shoulder.  The toy is sticky and wet between them, John’s stomach and cock are covered in come, and he can feel dried spit all over his groin and thighs from where Sherlock was licking him clean earlier.  He feels decidedly filthy, and like he needs a shower in more ways than one, but he thinks it is the best orgasm he has ever had in his life.
So instead of panicking, John sends Sherlock a text that is responded to in a timely manner and with a relieving, if somewhat vague, answer.
“If it were me, I think that I would probably poison her smoothie in the morning.  She is religious about getting one every day—”
That makes Sherlock  glance back at him, frown furrowing the smooth, porcelain skin of his forehead.  “What are you sorry for?” he asks, his look one of honest confusion.
Sherlock gasps into John’s mouth when he feels John’s arousal through layers of clothing.  John takes advantage of the moment to swipe his tongue along Sherlock’s, softening their frantic kiss slightly but making it no less deep.  His cock jumps inside his trousers when Sherlock bites down on his bottom lip and sucks at the slick skin softly, rubbing himself against John urgently.
“Is this how you want to come today?” he asks Sherlock, and the brunet man continues his squirming against the warmth of John’s legs, whimpering and nodding his head shamelessly.
It was not the most eye-appealing of wardrobe fixes—and he most certainly would not be able to tuck his shirt into the waistband of his trousers—but at least his bottoms would stay up.
And then he turned on his heel and left the office, head held high and his long overcoat fluttering about behind him.
Sherlock leans over slightly, not dislodging himself from John’s lap or John’s grip, to grab the bottle of lube.  It had rolled down next to John’s leg, pulled towards the man by gravity from where it had been thrown earlier, when John had come over to Sherlock’s thinking he was just going to have a nice, normal shag.  Once he has it, the teen settles back into position, wiggling his hips and making John groan at the feel of him in the man’s hand—Sherlock is so
They stay that way, holding each other tightly and breathing one another in until John decides that he can’t stay out any later and he reluctantly pulls away from the Sherlock.  Before he leaves, John takes one last look at him and reaches out a tentative hand to brush his index finger whisper-soft against the boy’s cheek.  Sherlock’s eyes slide closed and he leans his head into John’s touch infinitesimally.  John draws in a shaky breath and drops his hand before he does anything else, positive he won’t be able to control himself if he lets his touch linger.  The last thing he needs is a repeat of yesterday.  If this is going to work, he knows that he will have to be stronger, he will have to be better.  He
“Right then.  Do we need to discuss anything at all?  The side-effects, the procedure, the…results?”
It is surprisingly clean and mostly uncluttered when compared to the rest of the house that John has seen.  Sherlock left his blinds open that morning before leaving for school, so the bright light of the afternoon sun shines through and sets everything aglow.  There is no dust in this room, and everything looks decidedly lived in and well-worn, yet tenderly taken care of.  There are more pieces of scientific equipment set up along a desk to one side of the room, and the only real clutter comes from an alarmingly large number of books and notepads scattered around.  The pages of these notepads are all completely filled with what John recognises from class assignments as Sherlock’s spidery, cramped handwriting.  Some of the journals even have extra pages shoved into them haphazardly.  The strange, eclectic decorations continue in here, as well.  Hanging on one wall is a bison skull wearing a pair of rather expensive-looking headphones that aren’t plugged into anything.  There are also a few framed, glass-covered boxes scattered over any available flat surface that house mounted displays with insects of differing varieties pinned inside, mostly bees.  Leaning in one dark corner, looking forlorn and lonely—and being used to hold up a broken sideboard of a battered bookshelf—is an old instrument case.  John thinks it might belong to a violin or other small string instrument maybe, though it looks as if it hasn’t been touched in years.
The door creaked loudly as Sherlock pushed it open the rest of the way, and John tore his eyes away from Callum to look at Sherlock, smile still in place.
John crawls into his bed, so much colder without Sherlock lying next to him, and pretends to be asleep when Mary comes home.
It happens at other times, too, while they are out in public together, doing the shopping or just happily spending time with one another out in London.  Those little instances where Sherlock seems surprised that this is his life now, stunned that John is his finally and they are together at last, no more hiding.  Sherlock will be grabbing something off of the high shelf for him at Tesco’s (because he has had another growth spurt recently, leaving him slightly taller than John now, just on the right side of helpfully lanky), or walking beside John along the pavement, close enough to hold his hand.  John just can’t help himself at moments like these.  He will lean in close, press a kiss to Sherlock’s cheek or run a hand through his hair, slipping his arm around Sherlock’s slim waist and tucking Sherlock up close against his body.
It is a topical analgesic ointment, and Sherlock takes one look at it before he sniffles and nods, looking contrite.  John can’t help himself from pulling the child into a hug and dropping a kiss on top of frizzy curls before he lets Sherlock go and turns his attention to the bath.  It is halfway full now, and John grabs up the bottle of bubble bath that has sat unused under the sink for months now.  Mary won’t notice if any is missing, he is sure.  He pours a liberal amount under the faucet, letting it mix and froth up, creating a mountain of white foam that Sherlock stares at with wide eyes.
John nods his head, a fierce blush rushing into his cheeks.  But he still doesn’t meet the lovet eyes, because he can’t bear to say the rest of it.
He’ll never quite get over how Sherlock does that.  He doesn’t think he’ll ever get used to the shock of having his most intimate and secret fears and desires laid out before him in such a flippant manner.  But Sherlock is right.  Again.  Sherlock is always so bloody right.
John, though, didn’t seem to want to let it go.  “Did you get a fresh batch of pregnancy hormones in or something?” he asked Sherlock suddenly.
Once he is in his car he pulls out his mobile and shoots off a text with steady hands and a guilt-free conscience.  He could definitely use a drink at the moment, but he thinks there’s something else in his life now that might be just as helpful.
A couple of weeks into Sherlock’s second trimester, the brunette opened his eyes blearily one morning to find that it wasn’t the vicious nausea that had woken him. As usual, John was in the kitchen making breakfast, and for the first time in what felt like months, Sherlock’s stomach grumbled hungrily at the smells that were wafting in through his closed door.
Especially not when Lestrade had called earlier and said that there was a case waiting for them to take a look at.
“It was never like this with Mary, you know,” he feels the need to tell Sherlock from his spot across the room, voice pitched so that Sherlock can hear him.  “I never felt this…crazy over her.  Yeah, I loved her, and yeah, I wanted to be with her.  But that was it.”  He shakes his head, at a loss for words.  “It was just…normal.  What people who have never fallen in love think love should be.  I laughed with her and I fought with her; she has always had this way of making me angry.  But when I’m angry at her, that’s it.  I’m just angry.  I don’t think about how much I love her, or how beautiful she looks when her cheeks are flushed red as she’s yelling at me.  But with you…” John shakes his head, trying to find the words.  “Even when I’m angry at you—which is quite a lot, I’ll have you know—there’s still this part of me that wants you so badly.  I want you all the time, no matter what we’re doing.  Even when you’re throwing yeast on me like a loon, or pushing me out of your house, or deducing my sexual fetishes out loud, or telling me all of my biggest faults,” he says with an exasperated chuckle.  “There’s never a moment when I’m not crazy about you, when I don’t just want to take you in my arms and kiss you until neither one of us even knows what we are doing any longer.  I’ve loved people before, but it’s never burned me alive like this does.  So,” John pauses, stops to double-guess what he is about to say, wondering if it is the right time, but then he nods his head and continues.  “Yeah.  I may have thought before that I was in love with Mary…but now that I’ve seen how I feel about you, I can’t believe that I ever thought that what I felt for Mary was enough.  It wasn’t.”  He shakes his head again, looking over at Sherlock.  “It wasn’t nearly.  But you are.  You’re enough.  So yeah, if you asked me to, I would.”
“That’s all right, Crystal,” Dr. Greenwhich comforted the little red headed nurse as she sniffled and tried to untangle the mess of Velcro and tubing that Sherlock had made out of the cuff. “Mr. Watson is a doctor, and the only one who can spend any prolonged amount of time around Mr. Holmes without being mortally offended, it seems. We’ll get all the information that we need from him.” He turned stern-looking eyes onto Sherlock. “This once.”
“Sherlock?” he asks, looking away from the magazine and down at the boy lying beside him.  “What are you doing?”
As if the gunshot wound weren’t bad enough, John had to put up with the limp as well.  That had meant that his left shoulder and right leg were pretty much out of commission for a long time, and various sexual positions were completely out of the equation.  John learnt quickly that it is very hard to feel good about yourself when your wife can hardly stand to look at your body and you aren’t physically fit enough to pleasure her the way she wants.
“No, ‘m okay, Daddy.  Tub feels kinda nice against it.”  Sherlock’s speech is off, always a sign that he is deep in his headspace, either submerged in his role or so relaxed and content that he can’t form sentences correctly.  One way or the other, John is always happy to hear it.
“Not hungry,” is Sherlock’s reply from across the room, where he is lying on his bed with his face shoved into a thick book.  He is in a pair of pyjamas even though it is evening time, and John doubts very seriously that he has worn anything else all day.
John loves Greg Lestrade.  His husband is compassionate, caring, attentive, nurturing.  Understanding.
Feeling badly about his words, John reached a hand out to squeeze Greg’s shoulder and he gave the man a small smile, a silent apology.  “Just give him some leeway,” he restated his earlier comment.  “The pregnancy is really taking a lot out of him at this stage.”
.  He doesn’t say that, though.  Instead he says, “Maybe she’s right.  A few times I’ve thought about picking up some woman and just having a quick shag in the loo of a pub, just to get back at Mary, but then all I can think about is being crap at it.”  He frowns at himself in his reflection in the dirty mirror lining the back wall behind the bar.  He hardly recognizes himself.  “I think I’d feel even worse afterwards, if that were the case.  First time I could get back at Mary and I wouldn’t even be able to do it properly.”
He shakes his head without looking at her, his eyes intent on the front door.  His stomach is twisting into knots and there is a tightness squeezing at his throat.  He shuts the door to the car and is surprised at how hard it slams closed.  He takes a deep breath to try to calm himself down but it doesn’t help at all.
Sherlock shakes his head again, eyes wide and wavering, and looks as though he doesn’t know what to do for a moment.  John takes a second to marvel at him.  He doesn’t know how a 16 year old teenager can look and act so seemingly young but Sherlock is doing it, and doing it well.  “It feels strange there, too,” he tells John on a secretive whisper, “but that’s not all.”
“I’m going out for a pint,” John said suddenly into the oppressive quiet.  “I’ll come back home when you can prove to me that you aren’t a selfish prick anymore.”
.  John knows this.  He knows that he has saved Sherlock from the edge of despair just as much as Sherlock has saved him.  But Sherlock is still teetering on the brink, in danger of tipping over, because John isn’t there for him the way that Sherlock needs him to be, the way that John promised he would be.
They spend the rest of the day doing nothing of importance, Sherlock wrapped comfortably in his new, warm coat and the circle of John’s arms.  Later in the afternoon, Sherlock inexplicably wants to go to a seedier side of town for an early dinner and won’t take no for an answer.  John doesn’t understand these strange impulses that the boy gets and tries to convince him to go somewhere else, but Sherlock’s mind is rather firmly made up.  Sherlock says that he wants to see everything London has to offer; John has the odd feeling that he just wants to do something dangerous and thick-headed.
His breath caught in his chest at Sherlock’s words.  He stared at the tall, dark haired man, still buttoned up in his long overcoat because the temperature outside was dropping, and they hadn’t been able to get the thermostat to work earlier when they had gone out to flip on the electrical breaker.
,” Sherlock whimpers, and John notices for the first time that in his study of Sherlock’s arse, Sherlock has slipped a hand down his own body and his stroking his cock desperately, movements slow and languid.  His prick looks so hard; it is stiff and rigid as it hangs away from his tummy, straining in his hand.  John boggles at the fact that he has done that to the brunet.
“Are you going to come, Sherlock?” he asks, sparks exploding along his nerves with each push into the incredible heat around him.  “Are you going to come for me?  Come on, that’s it.”  He shoves in deep, pulling a long groan from Sherlock.  “Take it for me.”
At his acquiescence he hears John sigh happily above him and feels him bring a hand up to pet the back of Sherlock’s head, running his fingers through Sherlock’s hair.  “That’s a good lad,” he croons, and Sherlock takes his cock in a deep as he can in one go.
John entered the man without a word of warning, without a second thought. He pushed against the tight ring of muscle until he was completely sheathed in Sherlock’s warmth, panting at the heat of it. He knew he wasn’t going to last long, and Sherlock’s erection between them—red and swollen and leaking precum steadily—told him that the brunette wouldn’t be far behind him. He began to move, a gentle rocking motion that bordered on frantic, but he used what little willpower he had left to reign himself in. He didn’t want to hurt Sherlock.
.  And to know that it’s all for me…” he trails off and the wonder is back, but this time in Sherlock’s voice.  “No one has ever wanted me like that before.”
John can’t help but laugh at that, some of the constant worry he has for Sherlock draining away now that the boy is in front of him, safe for the time being.  “Even if it means you’ll keep getting beat up?” he asks with a smile.
Sherlock breathed in the musky scent of John, letting the smell pervade his senses.  He buried his face deeper into the man’s chest, drawing comfort from John’s words and John’s presence and John’s touch.
He can hear John’s breath catch.  “Wider,” he urges Sherlock, voice slightly wrecked.  And then there is a soft, “Attaboy,” when Sherlock complies.
He gets into the car and puts the key in the ignition, shifting into drive and heading towards Sherlock’s house.
“That’s it, I’ve had enough!” he snaps out, his tone biting, and he can see Sherlock stiffen imperceptibly at the sudden, harsh sound.  “Come over here, right this instant, young man,” John orders him, pointing to a clear space of floor right in front of the doctor in the graveyard of toys that is now their sitting room.  “We’re going to have a long over-due talk.”
“If the names aren’t hyphenated, then people will inevitably begin dropping the first surname and just calling him by the last one that appears on his paperwork—he’ll end up being just Holmes,” Sherlock answered, sharply.  John, taken slightly aback by Sherlock’s sudden vehemence, simply sat in his uncomfortable little seat silently.
John chuckled silently, so that Sherlock wouldn’t hear him, and made his way over to where Sherlock was lying, crouching down on his knees beside the couch next to Sherlock’s dark head.  He reached out a gentle hand and ran his fingers through Sherlock’s curls, black in the darkness of their flat.  He knew Sherlock was wanting John to reassure him, tell him that everything was not as bad as all of that, but he couldn’t bring himself to lie to the man—he wasn’t that kind of person.  So instead he continued to stroke Sherlock’s hair and he whispered, “Don’t you think I know that, Sherlock?”
God, he doesn’t know how Sherlock can keep blaming himself for things that John has ruined.  John wonders briefly if it has something to do with the fact that everyone Sherlock has ever loved has left him, therefore, in Sherlock’s mind, he thinks that he is responsible for having no one.  It makes sense when John thinks back on all of the times that Sherlock has desperately apologised or asked John to stay, asked John not to leave him.
He thought back to that night in Baskerville, after he had been down to Dewer’s Hollow with Henry Knight and had seen—what he had thought was at the time—the gigantic hound that had been stalking the poor, demented man.  He remembered the conversation he had had with John afterwards, at the inn, as he sat by the fire and shook and shook from his experience in the hollow.
They lie there quietly for a long while, just holding each other, until John feels Sherlock’s tense body start to relax in his arms.  Only when this happens does John loosen his hold on Sherlock, pressing a kiss to Sherlock’s forehead, on top of unruly, dark curls.  Sherlock takes advantage of the slight space between their bodies now to run his hands up and down John’s sides, over his back.  Suddenly Sherlock’s roaming hands sweep across to his stomach, then lower, ghosting over John’s groin on top of his boxers.  John thinks that it may have just been accidental so he doesn’t say anything, but when Sherlock palms his soft cock through his pants, John pulls away quickly.
John almost smiles down at the screen but remembers himself just in time and catches it.  Just because Mycroft assumes that Sherlock is the one who is texting John doesn’t mean that John has to admit to it and hand the man the gasoline if he is going to try to burn John.
However, John just cups his hand along Sherlock’s cheek and then runs his fingers through Sherlock’s hair.  “Sherlock, please,” he says, voice and face softening.  “Will you let me see for myself, love?”  Sherlock is probably right, but John just has to know for certain.  He doesn’t think he will be able to live with himself if he hurt Sherlock and didn’t try to make it better.
Sherlock looks at him, surprise showing clearly on his face at John’s declaration.  Then his features soften into a tender, happy smile, completely relaxed in a way that John hardly ever sees.  “Of course I do.”  He blushes and looks away for a moment, down into his lap which he is covering with John’s soiled vest in a rather bashful manner.  “You know, before you came along, I never expected to be anyone’s best friend,” he says quietly.  “Certainly not the best friend of the bravest, kindest, and most loving man that I’ve ever known.  I just want you to know that your friendship and love are the best things in my life.”  Sherlock looks up at the blond and John is so surprised by the words coming out of Sherlock’s mouth that he can do nothing more than stare at him in shock.  “I honestly don’t know what I would do without you.  You keep me right, John.  Even after all of the stupid times I’ve messed up,” he says, and they both know he is talking about that incident not too long ago, when he had left John for days and used again, and John had been worried sick.  John had forgiven him, though.  Sherlock had needed forgiveness—would always need forgiveness—and so John would always forgive him.  Sherlock looks back up at him with a dark conviction in his eyes, mouth set in a firm line.  “You don’t ever have to worry about anyone else that I meet,” he tells John conclusively.  “No one could possibly ever compare to what you give me.  It’s always been you.  It will only ever be you.”
“What?” Sherlock asks with a frown, and John can tell he is well and truly confused now.  John smiles at this sudden achievement.  It isn’t often that Sherlock is confused by anything and John thinks that the look on his face is quite adorable.
“Oh!”  Sherlock gasps as he bottoms out on top of John.  “You’re all the way in.”  He sounds wrecked, but there is a hint of amazement in his voice, as if he truly is astonished that he has taken all of John’s cock after all.  He wiggles around on top of John experimentally, moaning at the sensation of being filled, and John can’t tear his eyes away from the look of rapture on Sherlock’s face.
When he gets to Sherlock’s bedroom door, he takes a moment to listen, wanting to gauge the situation.  He can still hear the mumbling—a low drone of sound that John can barely make words out of—and he recognises the voice as Sherlock’s.  John wonders for a moment if there is someone else in the room who the teen is talking to, but it doesn’t seem like there is.  Sherlock is muttering broken, half-sentences in a way that he would never speak around another person, and when he asks a question he ends up answering himself, all in a low rumble of quick words that John can barely understand.
“Do you think you could get this from someone else?  Hmm?” John asks him, fingers tightening in inky black hair until Sherlock cries out, wincing in pain as John yanks roughly at the strands.  “Do you think someone else could fuck you like this, Sherlock?  There is no one—
John’s hand clenches around the phone tightly and he releases a sigh of happiness, his heart exploding in a frantic pace and butterflies erupting in his stomach.  He feels a huge smile growing on his face, and he doesn’t try to contain it.  It is the first time he has smiled in a week, and all it takes is his name showing through a text sent from Sherlock’s number.
But today’s was special. Because, in a few hours, he would hopefully have one more piece of vital information to put into his notebooks.
It is a bear, soft and plush; not overly large but a good enough size to not be swallowed up by Sherlock’s large hands.  John had made sure of that.  Its fur was a light caramel color and made out of the softest material John has ever felt.  The head of it was bigger round than the width of its body, making it almost impossible to sit up on its own.  In the center of its tummy and on its snout the fur was a patch of pristine white, standing out against the soft caramel color of its body.  Its eyes and nose were made out of big, black, flat expanses of thread sewn down tight, and its mouth was a long line of black thread sewn into a tiny smile in the center of its snowy snout.  Its limbs were short and stubby and at the end of each arm, leg, and in the center of each ear there was a yellow piece of felt that offset the caramel and white of the bear.
Whenever Sherlock instigates this game, John has learned the hard way that it is always best for him to pretend that everything is normal.  Once, at the beginning of a scene that Sherlock had started when they first began doing this, John had asked him if everything was okay and if Sherlock was sure he wanted to play.  Sherlock had gotten so angry at John that he’d stormed out of the room and hadn’t spoken to John for three days.  John was left looking after his moody teenage lover in bewilderment and alarm, wondering what he had done wrong.
Mary looks at him for a long moment, and John begins to wonder if he has finally been caught out.  But then she frowns and says, “That’s too bad, I thought he was definitely going to quit this time,” and John has to hold in a sigh of relief.
“Oh, of course!” the man replies.  “My name is Marcus and I met Mary this morning while we were getting coffee.  We got to talking and she said that she was new in town so I told her about some of the community events that are coming up.  There was a class that she seemed interested in that I teach and we exchanged numbers so I could keep her up to date on the schedule.”  The man laughs nervously over the line.  “But then I realised that I had given her the wrong number, so I just wanted to ring and leave her the correct one.”
Mary believes him readily enough, even if she doesn’t seem overly concerned about his well-being.  They spend the rest of the evening in silence, but John hardly notices; all he can think about is the look on Sherlock’s face earlier when he had asked John to stay with him for the weekend.  John wishes like hell that he could, but he had told Sherlock the truth when he said that he couldn’t.  He misses Sherlock so much, though—ever since they spent that weekend together, the stolen afternoons and evenings that they sporadically share with each other aren’t nearly enough.  And now he is going to have to spend a whole weekend away from Sherlock, with his wife…
“Your haircut and the way you hold yourself clearly says military, as does the fact that your face and hands are tanned but there’s no tan above your wrists or below your neck.”  The boy points to John’s hands and then up to the man’s neck, his finger impersonally close to the teacher’s body.  “It shows that you’ve been abroad recently, outside in the sun a lot, although not sunbathing.  But the head teacher called you
The next time they meet up, on a regularly scheduled day, Sherlock walks into the coffee shop sporting a spectacular black eye and a fat lip.
The pregnant man turned on his heel and took off down the entryway, into the depths of what had once been Mrs. Hudson’s flat.  John could do nothing but follow him stupidly, the foreman bringing up the rear.  In front of him, without even bothering to turn around, John heard Sherlock shout out over the hammering and drilling, “I bought the building, John.”
Sherlock goes back to the sitting room and plops down drearily on the sofa, where John has noticed a small, dying fire is crackling warmly away in the fireplace.  The lanky brunet bends over the coffee table where he has strewn dozens of papers, all with different formulas and equations on them.  Schoolwork, it all looks like from where John is standing in the kitchen, and so the man goes about silently making them dinner and letting his arousal drop down to a steady, low simmer as Sherlock completes his assignments in the other room.  While John cooks, the heat from the fire in the sitting room and from the cooktop in the kitchen merge together to keep 221b pleasantly warm for such a chilly evening.
