“Right.” John hesitated before turning off the bedside lamp. “Sherlock, just so you know--”
John swallowed the bile that rose in his throat. “Dreams, I think the humans call them.”
“Yes, I know not to touch you if you have nightmares.” Sherlock averted his gaze, acting as if the exchange was as casual as discussing what was for dinner. “Good night, John.”
Smart. Observant. Of course, she is. John wouldn’t waste his time with someone who isn’t. He pulls away, wrapping the scarf around his left hand, tightening it until the cloth rubs raw the skin on his palm. He is only distantly aware of the persistent ache, the dull throb of burned flesh.
. How someone could be so fond of mystery and intrigue and know nothing about the genre was beyond him. When the urge to laugh finally receded, he spoke once more. “Fine. Not the widow. Not the butler. My money is on the bellhop. He was awful twitchy.”
“Oi! That’s my bag.”
“Hmmm… I suppose it will have to do.” The soldier flicked his hand and suddenly they were surrounded by more soldiers stepping out from behind trees.
“I didn’t say I wasn’t going to forgive you, idiot. I just said that you did upset me.” He shrugged.
boy?” John growled, frustration and want slipping into need.
When Sherlock pulls out several lengths of cord, John’s shivers give over into something else entirely. His body shudders in anticipation as Sherlock ties one wrist to the headboard and then the other. It’s tight, but John flexes his fingers. His shoulder protests the abuse, but then it always does. Sherlock digs a thumb into a spasming muscle and John groans. Sherlock shifts the pressure, working the angry muscles there until they stop their relentless jumping. It’s not what John wants, this unexpected tenderness, but Sherlock is always thorough. John buries his face in his other arm, willing the tears building in the corners of his eyes into submission.
“Clever? Why would it be clever to leave a note around confessing to a crime? Wouldn’t it be more clever to destroy every last shred of evidence?”
“Bloody hell.” Lestrade swerved around a car that refused to move out of the way. Next to him, Sherlock vibrated.
So bunions were dealt with, paperwork was filed, and cabs were caught and then abandoned when they moved far too slowly.
He fumbles a moment more before pulling a plastic water bottle out of his jacket. “Is he all right?”
“How dare--,” she hissed and rose to her feet.
“Goooooood?” His penis snorted.
Sherlock straightened his scarf and looked away. An awkward silence fell between them. “It’s good. Seeing you. That is.” He cleared his throat. John had always hated when Sherlock played at pleasantries, and being on the receiving end of it was all the worse. It had never suited him. Sherlock wasn’t made for pleasantries.
“I did promise. William.” The name never failed to surprise him. It sounded strange in his mouth, tangling around his tongue and fangs.
“Yes, well, our Daniel does so love to make sure things are nice and secure.” Sherlock pulled out a slim black case from his coat pocket, withdrew a lock pick, and began to fiddle with the first lock.
Sherlock forces himself still. The urge to rush at John is clawing away at his throat, but every line of John’s body screams stay away. Instead, he painfully squats out of arms’ length. He grits his teeth at the pain that flares in his knee. It’s nothing, nothing in comparison to the sound of John’s voice.
“You should get back inside, your Highness. You have a party to attend.” John clutched the title to his chest, his only weapon against a man who had disarmed him.
“Steady. You’ll solve it.” John has only known Sherlock for a handful of months, but he is starting to figure him out. He has seen Sherlock manic, Sherlock depressed, Sherlock raging, and Sherlock cruel. But this is something new, a new piece that John turns over in his head, trying to place where it fits within the puzzle of Sherlock. There is a desperation biting at his heels and a tension to his shoulders that screams uncertainty. “Let’s go back to the flat. You haven’t slept in two days and I know you like to think you go without eating but you're just as human as the rest of us.”
“Wistful, huh? God, when did you get so bloody observant?” John shakes his head. “I suppose it’s a bit like that. I loved him, but he’s not in my life anymore.”
“Mr. Holmes, why are there toes in your cupboard?” John stared at the toes and tried not to imagine that the toes were looking back at him.
She turned a corner and stopped short. Two soldiers stood over her nest, hammers held high. At their feet lay the shattered remains of the eggs, the hatchlings dashed open the rocks. One of them swung a hammer at her head.
Sherlock grabs a handful of his arse and squeezes, pulling him tighter against him. John loses his train of thought after that. He ruts against him, chasing pleasure. The table squeals across the kitchen floor, but neither of them pay it any mind. He hikes Sherlock’s thigh up, encouraging him to wrap his leg around John’s waist. John tugs him up exactly where he needs him, his cock pressed against the plush line of Sherlock’s arse, and lets him feel the way Sherlock has driven him just as mad. He comes hard, pants still on, and laughs his way through Sherlock’s orgasm.
John nodded and ignored the little flutter in his ribcage. “Yeah. So, I’m going to kiss you now. And I might put my hand on your leg, if that’s okay.” He was fairly certain he sounded like an idiot, but he had found in the time he had known Sherlock that it was important to always state what you were planning before trying to do anything that might require touching. He moved forward slowly, his hand gently coming to rest on Sherlock’s knee.
“Still. You have work in the morning.” Sherlock smoothes the blanket under his hands, seeking out each wrinkle with steadfast focus.
“Why not?” Sherlock continued to fiddle. “Keep an eye out, would you?”
John slowly came awake, stone giving way to flesh. His eyes scrapped closed for a moment, before snapping back open. The last streaks of orange disappeared beyond the horizon. He glanced up. Clouds blanketed the sky, blocking out the early stars and promising a cold and stormy night ahead. Spring came slowly to the land, weakly warming the ground during the day, but retreating scared as a lamb at night. Frost would soon sap what heat had gathered.
Coffee quickly turned into breakfast. John wasn’t one for skipping meals. On the contrary, he relished each and every bite. It was easy enough to reason out the source of that. Durable, sensible clothing that could be patched up instead of entirely replaced; the way he checked his wallet and counted out his money. Years of growing up poor had taught him the value of a meal long before he entered the army. While he shoved forkfuls of eggs into his mouth, he hummed happily. Sherlock tolerated it only because it was a pleasant sound. John had a strange way of making everything tolerable.
“We thought you would never ask.” He clapped and two soldiers tossed William out into the center of the crowd.
“John.” Sherlock sits casually in his chair, arms and legs loose. Sherlock says his name like a long Sunday morning, lazily spent in. Even his relaxation grates on John’s nerves. How dare he look so fucking calm. What right does he have after everything that has happened?
“Usually, it isn’t.” Fantomas sighed.
“Yes, films. We have watched several while you were sleeping.” His brother--Murray-- grinned wide and proud.
Sherlock choked.
Be brave and angry.
“John, wait!” Sherlock ducked around a customer who tried to enter just as Sherlock was exiting. Things had not gone as he had hoped. Perhaps he should have led with the entire proposal? Sherlock hurried after him. The quick slap of his shoes on the pavement punctuated his ever increasing agitation. “John, please. You are being absolutely ridiculous. If you would just listen for five minutes--”
John spat blood at his feet.
John worried his bottom lip. “Holding hands.”
“Hmmm… I think a peek into his work shed would be in order.”
, John prayed. His gut pitched towards the ground, certain that there was no earth below him anymore.
“Brother, it is good to see you awake finally. Perhaps age is catching up with you after all. I feared the stone had finally taken you.” A deep rumble of a laugh echoed across the tower, soon followed by the large bulk of his clutch sibling crawling down the side of the wall. His stunted wings fluttered uselessly on his back, though the lack of flight never seemed to bother him. No, he had always seemed happy to crawl and scramble, leap and throw. The earth suited him; he was made of dark stone, deep as a forbidden cave. “The humans are celebrating. A royal feast!”
John carefully picked it up. It was a fine chain of silver, far more delicate than any work he had ever seen before. From it hung a small, round medallion with intricate scrollwork. He sniffed it. Magic, but not the cold harshness of what he had felt before. This was far too subtle, like yeast and warmth wafting from an oven. The man mimicked John then made a move that suggested John should put the necklace on. Instead of putting it around his neck, John wrapped the chain around his fist. If it was dark magic, it would be easier to throw away the necklace.
“Just go home to your Mummy, yeah? I’m done.” John swiped at his eyes, refusing to show the angry tears that had collected there. He marched, spine a steel rod and his stomach on fire, and refused to look back.
“To be fair, you still haven’t kissed anyone.” John bit back a giggle.
John smiles and removes a lid from one of the boxes. Rosie rolls her eyes and follows suit with her own box. They quietly pass the next few minutes shifting through old bits and bobs. Memories are quick to surface with each new item he unearths: his tags, a bit worse for wear these days. An old bottle of perfume, the contents long since evaporated. Papers, so many papers, good lord, why did he even keep all of this stuff?
“I’m only curious.”
“Yeah, what else is new,” she huffs before shoving away from him to pick at the box.
And so was John, cut adrift.
John paused; his slacks did not. Gravity did most of the work and they settled in a tangled mess around his ankles. Sherlock was not naked. And he was not naked in the sense that involved corsets and tiny lace panties. Despite that, he had managed to curl himself around a book in such a way to completely negate the very not nakedness of his entire lace covered torso. An uncomfortable lingerie pretzel.
The dinner went surprisingly well. His mother and father had been friendly and since Mycroft hadn’t yet arrived, Sherlock hadn’t had to deal with his incessant snooping. Though he wasn’t the greatest actor, John had a way of putting people at ease. He wove kindness in between gentle jokes and smiled as if it was the most normal thing in the world. Sherlock envied him, and he was beginning to wonder if his parents didn’t like John more than they liked their own son.
He chases his own orgasm heedless of John, and John revels in it. Being reduced, being ignored and humiliated, leaves John breathless. He is a toy to be used, something to get Sherlock off and nothing more. He gladly serves at Sherlock’s pleasure and like this, Sherlock is gorgeous to witness. His skin turns pink and sweat collects at his temples. John, mesmerized, watches as a bead of sweat works its way down Sherlock’s cheek and travels down his throat. Sherlock moans and his hips stutter as he nears orgasm. His arse tightens around John’s cock.
“Useful?” John shoved him up against a wall, not caring at the hurt that flashed across Sherlock’s face when his head impacted. Poison pounded in John’s veins. He pressed his arm against Sherlock’s throat. “You wanna know what it’s like? It’s eating the same shitty vegetables in a can every day. It’s wearing the same pair of ratty trainers until you are having to tape them to keep them in one piece. It’s being ten years old and worrying yourself sick about where the fuck you are going to live because your Dad just lost another job. It’s having your parents die on you and everything getting worse when you didn’t think that was even possible.” Sherlock stared at him with wide eyes, his fingernails digging crescent marks in John’s arm. John shook him off. He couldn’t breathe.
“Yeah? Well, you always said being alone protected you. Have fun with that.” The slam of the door echoes down the hallway.
A second explosion rocked the ground, showering debris onto the street from up high. Lestrade ducked behind a car, shielding himself from pebbles and glass. Once the dust settled, he spotted Sherlock running towards the building, heedless of the smoke, glass, and masonry raining down from above. Of course he’d take advantage of the chaos to slip past the people trying to contain the scene.
John opened the door and stepped out into the room in a puff of steam. “Sherlock, mind telling me why I woke up with my face in your armpit?”
“Ignore him. He does that.”
“Ah, the attack. Of course, it must feel like it just happened.” The man knelt in front of him. This close John could smell a spicy scent that clung to the man. “My name is Gerard Fantomas. You have been asleep for a very long time.”
John slowly takes his hand. As they touch, it feels much like the first time, but oh how he hopes it will be better this go around. A different Sherlock and a different John, weathered by age and experience, but here now, together.
“Right! Sherlock and I were just going. Nice talking to you, Addison.” John grabbed his cane with one hand and Sherlock’s sleeve with the other and frogmarched them both back outside. Once they were out of earshot, John released Sherlock’s arm. “Christ, you don’t have a filter, do you?”
He rips the lid off the bottle, dampens the edge of his scarf, then hands the bottle off to Mary. John drinks greedily, Adam’s apple bobbing in his haste to quench his thirst. A thin rivulet streaks down his chin, follows the path of his throat. His hand shakes as he tries to take the bottle from Mary; she gives it over gradually, hand hovering just in case. When he is finished, the bottle drops empty and useless from his hand. He closes his eyes, face weary-dark and ash smudged in the light.
“Yeah, I am sure that’s exactly what they were thinking. ‘Let’s pop off to some rich bastard’s place and make some noise. We hear Holmes is turning thirty-three today.’ Christ.”
“Because, surprisingly, the army generally likes to kit its soldiers out better than what you can grab at a Tesco.”
He wasn’t expecting Sherlock. The other man looked thin, far too thin, but healthy otherwise. He stared at him for a moment.
He gave Sherlock a chance to move a bit ahead and then tried to shift in his jeans without screaming to the world
“The chair?” John decided to ignore the jab about his haircut. It was a proper cut, no nonsense and easy to deal with. Given the amount of curls and the way Sherlock was dressed, he obviously wouldn’t know a thing about simplicity.
James came to rest next to John. He snapped his wings over them both as he helped his leader to his feet. “The others?”
“Can I…. can I see my mum now?”
“You care for him too much,” his second muttered next to him.
“Not right now, Sherlock.” John folds the laundry. It’s all socks and none of them seem to match.  His fingers twinge, spasming as the nerves in his shoulder pinch. His left hand shakes as he mates them regardless of color. Let Sherlock deal with that later. Let him fret over his goddamn sock index. John’s mind catches on the thought; he isn’t even sure if Sherlock has a sock index anymore. He drops a sock and it takes him several beats to bite back the inexplicable anger that builds.
John flushed and ducked his head. It was bad enough being caught picking through garbage, worse still to have someone critique his technique. He nodded and picked up his bags. “Thanks. I’ll keep that in mind. Think I am done for the day.”
“Yeah, well, forgive me if I want to make sure my daughter has everything she needs while she decides to skip around Europe.”
“You may have?”
“Oh, the last I saw of them, they were nothing more than rock. Useful for birds nesting but not much else. Perhaps once we put the fires out, I’ll have them dragged back here to decorate the castle.” He sniffed in disdain. “I hadn’t planned on the fire, but Mary and the King put up a bit of a fight.”
John growled, a boulder scraping across pitted earth. “I know what I am.”
Again.
John bunched his legs and pounced, claws and teeth at the ready. He knocked the weapon out of one assailant’s hands and smacked another off their feet with his tail. Easy work. These humans were no trained warriors, built for true hand-to-hand combat. They relied too heavily on their weapons. He slashed at the one just getting to their feet, ripping through the layers of cloth that they had foolish worn into combat. Tough material was no match for his sharp claws.
“He… he didn’t. He’s alive. Living somewhere in the country, last I heard.”
“Sounds like a truly lovely woman. So devoid of anything in her life that she feels the need to--”
He half feared Sherlock would make the boy cry with a mean comment about his sticky hands and snot-crusted, tear-stained face. Sherlock surprised him, but then that is what Sherlock constantly does to John. Every time he thinks he has Sherlock figured out, John is left on shaking ground. As they waited for Jamie’s mother and Lestrade to arrive, the boy refused to let go of Sherlock’s hand. Sherlock didn’t appear to mind and exhibits a softness to the boy that John has never witnessed before. Sherlock answered Jamie’s questions with an open, frank honesty, but never belittled him. John slid another piece into the puzzle: a gentle Sherlock, a kind Sherlock. It’s a sight made all the more precious for its rarity.
Sherlock scowled. “Simmons has a type.”
“No. Um, left there two years ago. Doing a bit of teaching now.”
“Yes, they hoped I would die from exposure. After all, I was only ten at the time.”
“I don’t remember that.”
Sherlock turns and studies the streets as they move past. He counts the traffic lights until John and Mary’s home. One. John huffs at his side. Two. He lets out a small snore. Three. Mary nudges him. Sherlock feels John shift closer to her. Four. John’s knee bumps against Sherlock’s leg. Five. Their house appears on the right.
He stared at Jonn, eyes flicking across his face, surely noting the dark circles, the stubble. In the grey light, he stretched out across the bright line and ran his hand down John’s front. When his hand slid under the sheet, John closed his eyes and bit his lip. Sherlock’s fingers rested, hesitating, for a moment on John’s hip before finally coming to rest on his cock.
Thank you to everyone sticking with the fic, even though it has been a bit between updates. As always, please feel free to come give me a poke over on Tumblr at UrbanHymnal.
Sherlock’s frowned and quickly shook his head, curls flopping forward to obscure his face. “No. Why would I?”
"Yeah, well my bum would have preferred if she took a more subtle approach. As would have my shoe."
The rain pounded down on them both; the storm refused to relent.
“Ah. Perhaps another go, then? We need to look convincing.”
“Well, I suppose that is better than--” John cleared his throat and looked away. The space between them grew, yawning wide before Sherlock.
“Of course. I’ll definitely take care of Sherlock.”
“He came to your mum’s funeral,” he confesses to the carpet (easier to look at than her wide, innocent eyes), but returns the squeeze of her hand.
“Are you sirs needing any help with anything? I could hear the shouting from the kitchen.” She was young, no later than her early twenties, and small. John had missed her entirely during his ranting. He supposed aristocrats liked the help to blend into the background; this maid managed to blend in with admirable skill.  “Had a bit of a run in with Ms Simmons’s dog?”
He ascended another set of stairs. Clean, fresh plaster gave way to dark, aged stone and the windows transformed into arrow slits. Fascinating. Fantomas had integrated a castle into his upper class flat in a nearly seamless design. Sherlock ran a gloved hand along the wall. Impossible to place the exact date of the structure, but the rocks were uniform, suggesting all of it had come from the same castle. The question was: why?
“I killed his wife,” Sherlock confesses.
“Why wouldn’t she be here? It’s her anniversary.” Sherlock turned his nose up, giving John the distinct impression that he was being judged for not knowing such a simple fact.
He tugged on his hair and spun in place in his living room. His phone gave another chirp.
And then he begins to fuck himself in earnest on John’s cock. He digs his fingers in John’s chest, bouncing as hard as he can. The sting of Sherlock’s nails on his chest work in counterpoint to the blinding urge to come. He rakes them down John’s chest, leaving irritated skin in their wake. Gentleness is for other people and right now Sherlock has no time for it.
“Sherlock. How did you--”
Sweat greeted his nose as he buried his face into the dark curls that surrounded Sherlock’s cock. He mouthed along the base of Sherlock's cock, tongue marking the line where skin disappeared into hair. This was his, wasn’t it? All of it? If he grabbed this chance, it could be again. God, he wanted it to be. He pressed open mouthed kisses across Sherlock’s skin, gently bit at his hips, and savoured the hint of musk that lingered on his tongue and in his nose when he nudged Sherlock’s cock out of the way and simply inhaled. In that smell resided a thousand memories of late nights, of running until his sides ached, of fumbling in the darkness for the feel of Sherlock's skin under his hands. He felt something painful unlock inside him and he dug his nails into Sherlock’s thighs. He missed Sherlock so much that every part of him ached. Even having him here right now only eased the hurt; it didn’t banish it. It was a wound from a different sort of war and it lingered.
“Right.” John sighed. “Think I’m done for the day. Why are you wanting to poke in trash anyway?”
“I knew, of course, our partnership was valuable to you. But a man of your strength, integrity, I knew that you would move on.” Sherlock berates himself even as he says it. Stupid, so stupid. “You had plenty of people you called friends, those that you could turn to and never seemed to have trouble with forming new relationships. While my loss would certainly be difficult, I had surmised it would be no harder than--”
“But I was simply curious. I was trying to understand what your life is like. Isn’t that what friends are supposed to do?”
“Ya know, you could help a bit.”
Sherlock made a face. “Honestly, John.”
“No, I would have deduced that.” He cleared his throat and winced.
The summer after his parents died, John beat another boy senseless. He didn’t feel it, the way his knuckles hurt from connecting with the boy’s jaw or how his eyes burned with unshed tears. Later he couldn’t even explain why he had done it, save to say that he had been so angry that he couldn’t breathe. It wasn’t like the boy had said anything that John hadn’t heard before, but that day he just couldn’t bear one more joke about his scuffed up shoes or the hole in his secondhand jeans. The anger had filled him up. Sometimes he imagined the rage as a snake, curled around his stomach, squeezing and biting his insides with its fangs until he was filled with nothing but poison.
He quickly shut off his phone before he became inundated with texts from both of his parents. More outpouring of emotion than he could handle for one day. Besides, it wasn’t as though he and John had ever actually gone out. It was just an exchange of messages online.
That had not gone like he thought it would. Sherlock stared up at the ceiling, arms still at his side. John was a heavy, relaxed weight against him. John looked soft, but it was all deception. How anyone could look at this man and not see past his plain jumpers and gentle smile? Lean muscle and hard edges hid behind his affable front.
“John.” Sherlock slowly rises from the sofa and raises his hands in supplication. “I know this comes as a shock--”
John huffed and ducked past him. “You were saying?”
Knight peeked over the edge of the wall and tilted his head. While many thought of them as bird-like, Knight moved more like a young hound, still unsure of its suddenly long legs. “H-h-he’s out d-d-doing patrol in the west, along the c-c-coast.”
. Right.
“Said I was fine.” John groans and thumps his head against the seat.
“Yes.” He peered over John’s shoulder. “May I come in?”
and rage. He puffs his chest and moves into Sherlock’s space, only to be hit again, this time hard enough to blur his vision. Sherlock hooks an ankle behind his and shoves John, quickly following him with another smack.
Sherlock’s mouth closed with a snap and he took a cautious step back from John.
“I am aware of that.”
“But you hated the names that humans gave us.”
He has held the weight of one in his hand, observed the way it sits in a chest cavity. A corpse is a corpse is a corpse. One heart looks much like the next, and he has seen enough of cadavers to know hearts are not the seat of the human soul, the source of reasoning, or the reason why we love. A heart is meat and nothing more.
“But he also said you were lonely and could probably use a friend.” John directed a soft half-smile at him.
John forced his face to keep from grinning. “If it were an actual experiment, shouldn’t we both go around kissing a bunch of different people? Ya know, validate results. Test the hypothesis.”
“Go on, then.” He had a feeling Sherlock would be offering one regardless of his response.
“Still doesn’t explain why you need a date.”
“But you talk about him the same way you talk about Mum.” Rosie frowns.
Sherlock tugged on his arm and John stuttered out a thanks and a promise to be back later as they headed out the back gate. The money felt heavy in his pocket. Maybe when he came back on Thursday he could slip it back into her purse? No, he wouldn’t want to risk being accused of stealing.
She tenses as a man breaks away from the gathered crowd. He runs up, hand fumbling in his pocket, and Sherlock notes the way Mary tugs John closer, but keeps one arm free. On edge. Looking for potential threats. Protective. Sherlock gives him another glance. Too clumsy to be a ruse. Jacket is well-worn, sturdy. Knicks on his knuckles. Calluses. Works with his hands.  Construction. No, plumber. Uneven stitching along the elbow of the jacket and the bags under his eyes say all Sherlock needs to know: single father, overworked, money used on things other than a new jacket.
wouldn’t mind.”
is being so understanding.” She ran a hand down his arm, lingering on his wrist.
Sherlock’s hand stops and John gasps, gulping down air. His cock and testicles ache with the need to come, but without Sherlock’s help, he can’t. He won’t beg. Not yet.
Sherlock swallows and curls his fingers to keep from running his hand along the blonde hair gathered on John’s thigh. The lines of his bedding blur; the edges grow watery as his vision fills with unshed tears. He blinks them back. “No, I suppose not.”
“Who said I did?” John rubbed a tired hand across his brow at Sherlock’s pointed look. “Fine. I did change my mind. Decided to figure out what exactly Mike had told you.”
He leaves London. The city holds little interest for him now. Crime scenes no longer entice them with their secrets. After years of chasing criminals and being chased in turn, he aches deep in his bones like winter has set permanently into his joints. Lestrade tries to talk him out of it by arguing that forty-two is far too young to retire, but it’s a half-hearted argument. The years back have been long and while he has learned to ignore the absence of John at his side, the joy of cases spent with him casts a shadow over every new case he takes on. No, three years back in London without John by his side is long enough. He is done with torturing himself and waiting for someone who no longer wants him.
“You must understand that I never meant for it to hurt you.” Not like this, never like this. Sherlock clings to the thought. For John. If not for him, then the past three years meant nothing. Every empty lonely night. Every terrifying moment, flinching from imagined and real dangers. Every bruise, welt, scar, and broken bone. Always for John.
“Soldier, why is there a giraffe in the operating room?” John’s voice was thick with sleep, but still managed to come out military-sharp.
The riding crop snaps down across his thighs, adding a brighter red line to his already pink skin. The next hits him across the hips. Again and again, Sherlock brings down the crop, snapping it in quick succession only to tease it along John’s tingling skin the next second. His skin is on fire. Each strike burns hotter and hotter, until his skin feels numb with it. Sherlock rests for a moment, stretching his shoulders and running a cold hand along John’s too hot skin. In the quiet, John heart beats hard against his chest and his breath comes in desperate pants. His brain feels hollow, empty and light in away it rarely feels.
Fire had never bothered him.
William slipped in the mud and fell to his knees. His hair lay lank and damp across his forehead, his brilliant curls sapped of color. He looked up at John. In the grey of the night, William looked nothing more than a spirit, a wisp of a memory. For a moment, John saw the earth open up, an early grave welcoming William into its embrace. He blinked and the vision was gone, leaving behind only the broken face of William staring up at him.
“No, let me just say this. We don’t talk. But you need to know.” John’s lips purse as he struggles with himself. He nods once, and rushes on. “Yeah, no, you need to know that I am grateful. For you, that is. You saved my life. No— you did. You saved my life and I never thanked you. Not really. This past few months have been shit, if I am being honest. But you have been there. Not just for me, but for Rosie, too. So, thank you.”
William’s hand dropped, fingers curling at his side. His smile wilted. “I suppose that is true. You even have snow clinging to you. It must be nice not to feel it.” He cleared his throat; his eyes cast about the room, fingers flexing in an odd show of nervousness. “You were showing me how to throw someone. I’ve been practicing, of course, but the soldiers fear hurting me. Ridiculous.”
“Good riddance. Hated those things. Leaving hair all over the place. Nothing but a nuisance.”
John took stock of the younger gargoyle. Usually Knight was one for caution, but the chance to explore apparently outweighed his fears. John sighed.
Sherlock rubbed at his eyes. “John?”
A painting—
He slid his key into the door, only to have the door open suddenly with a flurry and a resounding smack as it hit the hallway wall. Sherlock stepped out onto the stoop, coat half on, only becoming aware of John standing on his doorstep at the last moment.
Sherlock studied the wrinkles around John’s mouth, the dip of his cheeks from too many skipped meals, meals given over to Sherlock to keep his mind sharp, to keep him going. This was yet another thing they never talked about. Sherlock had taught John how to dance well and now their days were spent dancing around each other and a thousand missed conversations. “And now?"
None of it matters in the end.
It should.
“Um, yes. In fact. A date.” Sherlock straightened the lapels of his jacket and jutted out his chin, as if daring John to take a swing.
“From a bit of cement?”
“No one keeps a photo like
Besides, John married last spring.
“Guards! Tremaine!” He spun in place, searching for the guards that should be defending the castle. Instead, he was met with silence. He had not seen Mary in the town, nor was there any sign of her here. He charged through the flames, ignoring the way it licked at his clothes. Their nest was deep enough within the castle that it might have been spared. He moved toward the tower that housed the entrance to the lower levels.
“Kissed someone.”
“Shut it. Right now."
The great gate into the castle stood wide open. He landed hard in the courtyard. Flames licked every wood surface, throwing up smoke and heat in all directions.
John licks his lips and resists the urge to tell Sherlock to hurry up. Pinching and a few smacks aren’t enough. John wants to hurt for days and to feel every last bit of anger bleed right out of him. He keeps his thoughts to himself. It will only make things take even longer and right now John wants the pain. Still, Sherlock doesn’t bring the crop down right away; he slaps his hand over the already forming bruise on John’s thigh. Another smacks lands just below it. Another above. The next blow hits John unexpectedly hard on his testicles and John’s vision darkens at the edges. He attempts to curl inward, but the ropes refuse to give. He breathes through the pain. When he unclenches, Sherlock raises a brow at him. John nods.
“Yes, well.” John cleared his throat.
A jade pin—
The urge to howl in triumph surged up John’s throat. He spat out a bit of blood and dragged his tongue across his teeth. No lasting damage there, though his cheek smarted something awful. A grin fought to take over his face, only to drop when he turned towards Sherlock and saw that he was cradling his arm.
Knight whimpered. He darted his eyes to his companion, waiting for orders.
“Really? Loved my aunt’s. Cute little orange thing, would curl right up next to you, happy as can be.”
He grabbed a pillow and placed it over his lap. It failed to muffle the laughter coming from his crotch. He thought of his violin teacher: thin, nose like a hawk, incredibly irritable, large buck teeth. His penis thought of John: warm, wet, covered in soap, his hand wandering south to his--
Ms Simmons ducked down and scooped up her dog. She gave it a quick kiss on the head. “Oh, who is being a bad girl today? Grumpy little puppy. Yes, you are. You’re Miss Grump Grumps.” She smile. “And here Mr Watson--”
The voice brought John up short. Just up ahead, he saw Sherlock knelt over a small ball of fur. His hand was curled protectively around the thing’s head. Two burly boys stood over him, one of them quickly growing red in the face.
“The groundskeeper, John. Do keep up. Believes himself to be a bit of a police officer.” Sherlock snorted. “Delusions of grandeur.”
I can’t.
“Not a joke and please stop assuming I am a serial killer or whatever it is your brain has cooked up.” Sherlock rolled his eyes. “Honestly, I arranged this meeting in a public place. If I wanted to murder you, I certainly wouldn’t have picked a coffee shop. Dull. No, I sent you the invite because you seemed the best fit for what I need.”
She let her legs fall lax in invitation and he bit and kissed his way down. His blond head disappeared between her legs.The first flash of his tongue was perfection. She grabbed a fistful of his hair, willing him closer. His tongue followed. This was her right and she rode him, hips snapping at each pass of his tongue, until she too cried out. The sharp bite of his teeth in the flesh of her thigh sparked high and bright as she came. Pain and ecstasy entwined. When they both abated, John climbed back up. The hard line of his cock brushed against her stomach, reminding her that he would soon take her again and again.
“Skip the shower tonight, yeah? This do?” Mary holds up a damp flannel and John nods, taking it and running it across his face, neck, down his arms, and then ineffectually makes a go of trying to clean his hair. He quickly gives up on getting it clean and sets the cloth down on the bedside table. Mary hands over a glass of water and pills.
Sherlock had already fled the house by the time John got there the next morning. A quick search found him sitting out on the pier of the pond behind his house. It had been a mild winter, but John could smell that the weather would be turning soon. Before long, snow would coat the trees. Sherlock’s face was upturned, eyes closed. In the grey, wintry light, he looked inhuman, distant and lonely. He tugged his jacket closed and sat down next to Sherlock. Neither of them spoke, simply enjoying the presence of the other. Eventually, John snickered.
William swallowed and looked away. “Was there ever any doubt we were anything else?”
“It wasn’t easy for me, either.” He didn’t want to think about the long stretch of black that was his hospital stay. Every moment had been filled wondering if anyone gave a damn that he had lost everything. It had felt a little too much like losing his parents. The psychiatrist had told him it was a grieving process, just like losing someone close, only it was him that was lost this time. He didn't say it, but Sherlock read it as it flashed across his face.
“Goliath, I mean you no harm.” The man smiled. “That medallion is a simple bit of magic, but it helps with the language barrier. I assure you it will do nothing more than that. No trickery.”
“I hope you prefer frostbite, ‘cause that is where you are headed.”
“I thank you each for coming to this feast. My son, William, has finally come of age, and this deserves cheer and celebration. The Lord has blessed us with his continued improving health.” Several people nodded and politely clapped their hands. Before he could continue, the doors to the hall opened with a loud creak.
Sherlock finally glanced up from reading. “John?”
John’s face twisted and his nose wiggled. Half-formed thoughts marched across his brow as his tired brain tried to figure out the new puzzle. “Right. At least you got rid of the bloody elephant.”
William flinched. He raised one hand in supplication, mud clinging to his fingers. “John.” A prayer. An offering.
“John.”
Sherlock wrestled his arm free. “I was gathering data.”
(See the end of the chapter for
“Sherlock?”
He knew as soon as his father had suggested opening the castle doors to the people of the town that this dinner was something sinister. The only bright spot in all of this was that John would be in attendance. Granted, he hadn’t told his parents that he had invited the leader of the Gargoyles, but it was his birthday after all. Surely he should be allowed to invite whomever he wanted.
“Where are they?”
“Don’t. Just. Don’t.” He slapped his hands on the table and stood. “Just sit there and drink your water.”
Ah, yes. The toes. Perhaps he should have gotten rid of those before the mold had started to cover them. Sherlock stood, wobbled for a moment, then slunk over next to John. The toes had been in there for some time, long enough now that Sherlock wasn’t entirely sure he was looking at toes. Or at least, not just at toes. It was a pity he hadn’t thought to set up a camera to record their decomposition.
He couldn’t help but find them fascinating and John even more so. While some people feared the Gargoyles, muttering about curses and the power of the Devil, William saw something wondrous. The Devil didn’t create; he destroyed, and the Gargoyles were fiercely protective. They had already defended his people countless times. Despite John’s short temper, he always believed in preserving instead of destroying. He had the mark of God on him, not demon. He may not be made in the image of God, but he was more intelligent than most and there was a rough kindness about him that William had grown increasingly fond of.
“Don’t be tedious, John.” Sherlock studied his shoes. He would definitely need to give them a shine before the trip.
“John.”
Sherlock shook his head. “No. That’s not it. You don’t like taking her money because she’s poor.”
The voice sounded human, but there was a deep gravel to it that suggested something darker, stranger. Sherlock raised his torch.
“Films!”
“Yeah, yeah. This is fine.” John fumbled for a moment with his wallet, then scooped up the bag sitting next to him. “Keep the change.”
“You bastard. If it wasn’t for the fact the first one happened ten years ago, I’d say you’re the one going around murd--” Before John could finish his sentence, Sherlock grabbed him by the shirt and kissed him. Or at least it was an attempt at a kiss. Sherlock kissed with teeth and force and clung to John with too many limbs. It was a bit like being kissed by an angry squirrel. It was all rather disappointing, because Sherlock had lips made for kissing, if he would just use them.
Sherlock paused only briefly in his inspection of a mildewy slice of watermelon. “Because you are an idiot.”
The water is rising. Up ahead, he can hear John’s screams, but his feet slip and sink in the loam each time he gets closer. His heart is valiantly trying to stay alive, clinging to the hope that Sherlock will make it to him in time.
“Among other reasons.” Sherlock shifted his weight and his hand accidentally brushed against John’s, before coming to rest in his own lap once more. John’s hand tingled, but he blamed it on the cold.
“It’s not them I am worried about. You haven’t met the rest of the family yet.” If he had brought anyone else, he’d be worried about his extended family eating them alive. Not John. John had already proven himself invaluable.
Maybe he will try his hand at keeping a garden.
When he was a child, his father built bonfires every summer when they visited the beach. It was a time honoured tradition, according to his father (a waste of time, according to Mycroft) and in those early years, Sherlock loved the simple task of gathering the bits of wood he could carry under his father’s watchful eye before heading down to the shoreline. When he asked why he couldn’t just burn the sticks they found at the beach, Mycroft sniffed at him, having already perfected his look of disdain and haughtiness, and told him it was toxic to do so. (Sherlock sneaked pieces of driftwood home, tucked in his pockets, and later burned them in a coffee tin, and never forgot that sometimes things that were dangerous could also be beautiful.)
“Please don’t be dull. You were interested in me before you ever saw a picture. You liked that I was intelligent, you liked that I could talk circles around you, and you liked the thought of me being musically talented. Usually you prefer dark haired people, which I didn’t plan for or I would have chosen a different picture, but I suppose it worked out for me in the end.” Sherlock waved his hand. “Everything else is just window dressing.”
The streetlamp finally gave up its long fought battle. In its last moments, all that could be seen was the flurry of grey outlining the skeleton of London. True darkness fell across the street and spilled into their flat.
“Impossible. Come on then. Let’s be sure to give the royal family our regards.”
“Oh, I don’t know. Perhaps because I told them that?”
“Yes, I heard you. I chose to ignore you because you are an idiot.” Sherlock bent down to examine the cat, leaving his back entirely unprotected from the two boys.
John froze. It was a ridiculous suggestion. Absolutely stupid. They hadn’t exchanged words in years and now Sherlock was swooping back into his life as if nothing happened. So why did he desperately want it?
“Could have just been snooping around.”
Good lord, the papers would have a field day.
“Stay.” Sherlock’s hand tightened against the back of John’s head, then soothed his hair down. “Oh god, stay.”
“Fine, fine.” John schooled his expression. “Well, it’s not that hard. Little less teeth and spit. Little more letting the other person lead.”
So maybe he did want to play a game of his own. Maybe he wanted to see just how flustered he could make Sherlock, see if he could throw him off balance the way Sherlock had done to him. And oh god, was Sherlock easy to throw.
Tremaine lowered his voice. “I am hoping we can deal with this quietly. The King knows of the situation and has agreed that it would be best to not alarm anyone just yet. It may be nothing.” He lead them into the nearby treeline, following a small hunting path. If they continued this way, it would lead them to the coast, but he stepped off the path and guided them deeper into the trees. Soon the fires from the castle walls could no longer be seen.
She bit his lip hard enough to draw blood. Copper danced along her tongue and she lapped at his mouth. Against her thigh, she felt the heavy weight of his cock growing hard. She snaked a hand between them and wrapped her hand around his length through the cloth of his kilt. He stilled under her hand. His limbs shook around her, a poor imitation of a cage. She squeezed him and dragged her hand up his cock, before bringing it back down once more in a rough jerk.
Fists still clenched at his sides, John drifts just out of his reach. They stare at one another, finally seeing each other for what they are, what they have become. Sherlock breaks his gaze first. After all, this is Sherlock’s penance and John’s retribution.
John keeps his eyes firmly on Sherlock’s chest, never wavering, never once lifting to look Sherlock full on in the face. He wouldn’t. Not now. Not with Mary. His movements are brisk and businesslike, refusing to linger tenderly or to pause in their ministrations. Anger, barely checked, shadows John everywhere, and remorse has become its constant companion.They simmer under John’s skin, but he never explodes. Not at Sherlock, at least. Maybe it would be better if he did, lancing his own infected wound and letting all the rage finally out.
He always has. Never a good enough son or friend or lover. But god, he thought maybe this time he would get someone to stay.
They had been words for a stranger, an acquaintance, not for a man who had once been everything in John’s life. Sherlock had nodded, a half-smile tucked into the corners of his mouth, and had played along and even as John played it back in his mind, he winced at how hateful the whole thing had been. John held no illusions that their distance was anything other than his own fault.
“You got all that from how he walked?” John craned his neck over his shoulder and saw Sherlock shrug.
Sherlock slammed the door in frustration and stomped up the stairs. He would never understand
“You died. Oh god, you died. You can’t be here. Fucking Christ, Sherlock.” John buries his face in his hands.
“I was thinking about maybe going into the military.” John scratched at a water mark on the table and kept his eyes firmly down. He didn’t want to see what Sherlock thought of that. Despite his nonchalance, being a soldier was something he had dreamed about. It’d give him a chance to get away, far away, and do something actually worthwhile with his life, instead of spending every day just trying to get through it.
John shut the door and finally looked around the room. Expensive furniture made to look rustic decorated the room. A large bed rested against one wall and hanging above it was a large painting of a hideous dog. It managed to give the appearance of staring both at John and at the wall opposite it. One tooth poked out of its mouth, tugging its jowl upward. It was impossible to tell what breed it was, but John was sure it had papers that proclaimed it was of royal pedigree. Nothing had a jaw like that wasn’t royal. He was going to have nightmares with that thing hanging over the bed. Speaking of which.
John looks at him in wonder, eyes soft and warm. “You really do mean that, don’t you? It never even occurred to you to walk away. Not even after what I did.” John brushes his knuckles over Sherlock’s cheek, tracing the ghosts of long healed bruises and cuts, then cups it in his hand. “You know you can ask me. For whatever it is. You deserve happiness, Sherlock. Real happiness, not playing at it. You’ve given so much. Tell me what you need. Please.”
John snapped his wings closed, banking sharply, before opening them again. He let his feet skim the river for a moment, gliding between air and water. His lessons with William were growing more frequent and as the prince grew in strength, so too did the strange flutter in John’s stomach. “I don’t know what you are talking about.”
Sound built slowly; it came in waves, cresting and washing over him. The blaring of horns and shouts of people echoed in his ears. Next came smell. Smoke tickled at his nose and throat, leaving its acrid trace behind to linger. Was the castle under attack? Where were the others?
“Best sex is messy sex, I always say.” John grins down at him. “God, I’ve wanted to kiss you for so long.”
Grocery list forgotten, John began to run. Even as he neared Sherlock, the red faced boy grabbed Sherlock by the arm and twisted. A pain-filled gasp slipped past Sherlock’s lips, only to be silenced when the other boy hit him hard across the face. John plowed into the boy holding Sherlock, sending all three of them to the ground in a tangle of flying fists and kicking feet. John tasted blood as someone’s elbow connected with his jaw. He lashed out, driving his fist into the boy’s stomach again and again. The other boy looped an arm around John’s neck and pulled back, only to let go with a yelp as Sherlock clawed at his face. After that, John was too preoccupied with keeping his own face from getting bashed in. He didn’t believe in fighting fair. He bit and punched, pulled hair and kicked.
Ahead of him, Sherlock tossed his coat carelessly onto the sofa and spun off towards the kitchen. Just over the din echoing in his ears, John heard Sherlock mutter about plates and utensils. John set the bag of food on the table. “I wasn’t sure if you still liked Pad Thai or not, so I got a bit of everything.”
John shakes his head and fights a grin. “Try? I got it open. Your little lockpicks didn’t manage that.”
He boxes up the last of his things, kisses Mrs. Hudson on the cheek, and deletes John from his phone. Their last exchange, now over a year ago, rings with a finality that aches just as bad as his joints, but he has come to live with that ache, too. Time to close that glorious (horrible), beautiful (destructive) chapter of his life.
For having just been attacked, the guards were easy enough to slip past. Sherlock darted down the hallway, ignoring locked rooms on other side of him. Video feeds lied just as often as people did. When you added in a man who ran a multi-million pound company that specialized in technology, the chance of the video feed being useful dropped significantly. No, Sherlock trusted his own senses more.
“William?”
John stares at him, eyes wide and disbelieving. When he finally breaks the silence, a hysterical laugh bubbles up through his throat. “You selfish bastard, why wouldn’t it have hurt me?”
“Liar. I can always tell when you are lying.” In the moonlight, she looked more ghost than flesh and blood. Her stone was white, bleached by the sun, and she disappeared easily against the harsh snow that clung to the land. While he was the color of sand, of dirt, she shone, her stone sparkling prettily when the moonlight hit her just right. She, more than any of his kind, looked human, angelic almost. Perhaps that was why William had taken to calling her Mary, though John felt the name ill-fitting. There was little about the Holy Mother that suited her. Blood and sword bedecked her more often than a gentle hand or a kind smile. He wouldn’t ask for anyone else at his side in combat. The humans often forgot that angels were warriors.
“Simmons is accustomed to a certain life-style. Her family used to own a great deal of land before they fell on hard times. She married late in life as she had no interest in children. Since then, every man she has married has been wealthy and has left everything to her upon their death. Yes, I think it was something else.” Sherlock grinned.
“Mummy threw a fit when I tried. Said it was unsanitary. Besides, I needed a wider sample.”
“Haven’t the faintest. Molly gave them to me.”
“And here
“Oi! Watch it!”
The air freezes in Sherlock’s lungs. His mouth moves, but sound has left him, choked off by the knot quickly forming in his throat.
Sherlock’s eyes widened. “You are laughing at me.”
“Bit more worried about you right now. Plus I think it’s beyond our help.”
He grabbed Sherlock’s hand and pulled him inside. The over-eager bellhop greeted them once more and moved to take them to their room. John cut him off before he could give another snappy greeting. “No need. Just give me the bloody key and point me in the right direction.”
Sherlock checked his phone. It was only half past ten, but he supposed John was used to keeping a regular schedule. Skipping sleep when he didn’t have to must seem foreign to John. Soldiers and doctors valued any nap they could get. “Yes. For a bit anyway.”
“Ah. I suppose that was forward of me. Of course, you would want your own space. I’ll see myself out.”
“Right. So, for the purpose of our experiment, no tongue. Just lips. I can put my hand on your leg. You can put your hands wherever you like. Should we set a timer?”
Sherlock turned and tucked his bare foot under him, directing his full attention to John. “Are you going to use your tongue?”
“Er…right, well ignoring the fact that I am not a woman and won’t be popping out any children-- how about you stop murdering your suit jacket?” John stilled Sherlock’s hands. “So you asked me along because you wanted to head off all the talk before it could get started. And the case?”
“Thought I might.” John swallowed. “That okay with you?”
“Funny. I might say the same about some of them.”
“What do you make of that?” He pointed at the fires, now much clearer as they approached. What first seemed indistinct in the distance, now resolved into the shapes of an encampment.
“You sure?”
“When have you had the chance to practice? I was only showing you last night.”
Sherlock squeezes his scarf between his fingers. He edges forward, fingers hesitant, before gently wiping the fabric across John’s face. It scratches across his cheek, catching in the fine stubble there. John hums and leans his weight against Mary’s chest. Another swipe and the black smudges around his nose and mouth slowly vanish to reveal too red skin. On the next pass, John mumbles against Sherlock’s fingers, catching one of Sherlock’s knuckles against his chapped bottom lip.
“Yes, a misunderstanding.” He squeezed harder. Sherlock squeezed back. For a moment, they engaged in a battle of wills, each refusing to back down and each refusing to stop crushing the other’s hand. Finally, Sherlock made a show of bumping against John to cover up him stepping on John’s foot. John covered his shout with a cough.
“Excellent. I’ll show you the best path to take. It’s probably for the best that you won’t be flying.”
Maybe even then they had known they had run out of time.
He slept. Or he thinks he slept. Or he thinks he thought about sleep. Or or or or…
John jerked his head up and peered through the window. Through the gloom, the familiar sight of 221b was just barely visible up ahead. Snow, barely enough to call a flurry, still had the drivers of London on high alert. The cars uphead moved at a snail’s pace, their drivers eager to be out of the weather before it turned worse but hesitant to speed along the streets. Unwilling to be caught in the mess, the cabbie had pulled into a side street. He now drummed his fingers on his steering wheel and raised an eyebrow at John in the mirror.
“I would have followed you, you know. If you had asked. If you had just asked me, I would have gone anywhere you needed.”
John made a move to strangle Sherlock, then dropped his hands to his sides. He clenched his fists and thought of nice things: warm milk, puppies, a really nice arse, Sherlock’s really nice-- no. When he finally suppressed the urge to strangle or possibly do something entirely different  that certainly did not involve shutting Sherlock up in a variety of creative fashions, he smiled. It should go on record that Watsons have a particular smile. This smile, passed down from generation to generation, was known as the ‘I’m going to destroy you, but I will be polite while doing it’ smile. John was a master of it. “Sherlock, is there a case?”
The knife in Sherlock’s stomach twists horribly. What has Sherlock done?
“But I do.” The man’s face twisted in a smile. “I must thank you for dealing with that loose end. Tremaine was, of course, useful in getting your...clan out of the way. They won’t be bothering anyone for quite some time. I was indebted to him for that.” He kicked the now dead man’s body. “I hate owing anyone.”
John nodded absentmindedly, the ghost of old feelings already whirling around the heavy lump sitting in his stomach. He didn’t know the name of it yet, but it felt a little too much like dread, like uncertainty, like cowardice, for his liking. He ducked out of the cab and clutched the plastic takeaway bag in his fist, letting it bite into his skin. He barely heard the cab pull away or felt the snow gathering on his eyelashes.
John.
John sniffed. He felt a bit like a bull ready to charge and Sherlock had just waved a red flag in front of him. “Why?”
A cab is already waiting when he makes it to the kerb. John is staring at the open door with the empty confusion of someone who is too worn to make sense of anything around them. Mary tugs at his sleeve, trying to maneuver him into the open door.
His thoughts danced giddily, torn between shock and fascination. A man with wings, claws, a tail? A thing of fantasy, yet all evidence suggested that the creature was indeed right there. Sherlock suppressed the urge to giggle. He had never seen something so glorious in all his life. Sherlock flashed the torch over the rest of his form. Smooth, strong muscle bunched under tan skin, hinting at years of training. Blond hair barely hid the small horned nubs which crested the top of his forehead. The only clothing he wore was a kilt and sporran, finely made but not enough to keep a person warm. Each thought flitted across Sherlock’s mind, quickly being filed away in his mind palace.
“I thought that was obvious.” He gestured at the takeout bag once more.
John jerked awake with a gasp, then stilled. He balled his fists into the bed sheets and lifted himself up to look around the room.
The shed was most definitely locked. Several times. A heavy padlock just out of John’s reach adorned the door, followed by a deadbolt a waist height, and finally yet another padlock towards the bottom. Either there were golden rakes and diamond-encrusted pottery beyond the door or Daniel fancied himself as someone who would survive an apocalypse. Probably a bunker full of canned beans and coffee eagerly awaited the day zombies walked the earth. Even the small window was covered in chicken wire and a tarp to block out any prying eyes. “That seems...excessive.”
“You relax.” John pulled at a loose thread. God, he felt shabby sitting next to Sherlock. It didn’t help that the pictures of this bed and breakfast revealed it to be a manor. He had been imagining a farm house, large enough to accommodate several people, but still homey in its own way. This place had a chandelier in the foyer and a large barn that had been converted into a garage to house the guests’ cars. There were even servants’ quarters. Christ, he had never been in a place this nice before except on a guided tour. Not that long ago, a room that was quiet enough that he didn’t wake up to gunfire every five minutes sounded nice. This was
“John, I would like to say that--That is. I think. You need to understand that. What I said.” He growled and slammed his hand on the table. “This is ridiculous. You know I didn’t mean to upset you.”
“Shut up.” A laugh built up in his chest. Sherlock was a complete git, but at least he kept things interesting. He could be sitting back at his flat with nothing to do. Instead, he was standing in a luxurious lavatory (and who honestly decorates a lavatory like they are expecting the queen to pop in?), with one soaking sock, a stinky boot, and a grin that refused to stop blooming across his face.
Fond? No, that wasn’t the right word for it at all. Cared for. Loved, if he allowed himself to tend towards fanciful things when he was alone in his room at night. John had never found his questions odd (
“John, rid yourself of the frown. I have simply chosen a name for myself: Murray. He is an actor and very funny. He does these things called…? Hmmm…”
A shopping cart smacked into the back of his legs as yet another harried holiday shopper attempted to maneuver around him. He barely kept a curse in check and pressed his chest closer to the shelf. Any closer and he would be scaling the damned thing. The woman and her screaming train of children scurried past and John took that as his cue to get out of the store. He shoved a can of beans into his basket and charged down the aisle. If he straightened his shoulders enough and kept his head down just the right way,he had found people had a tendency to just move out of his path. What he lacked in height, he made up for in sheer stubbornness. He turned a corner sharply and plowed right into another person.
It took him a full week to check on Sherlock. After returning back to the home with a bruised face, torn jeans, and no groceries to speak of, Mr. Carter put him on lockdown: no leaving, extra chores, in bed by nine every evening. He couldn’t even sneak off to use the phone. The only consolation was that at least that was all of his punishment. Fear had sat ugly in his chest at the thought of being shipped somewhere else, being actually locked up. It helped that the boys he had fought with apparently hadn’t uttered a peep about the fight. They were probably too afraid of looking the fool for getting their arses half-kicked by Sherlock. Still, for the next week and the days following, John walked on eggshells, certain that one more slip-up would mean the loss of any freedom he had.
“This all right, then?”
Sherlock stares up at him. A thunderous roar fills his ears. This wasn’t how it was supposed to happen. Three years. Three years of fighting, of barely surviving, just to get back to London. To John.
“I could serve as a lookout as well and any cans I find until the next time we meet, I will set aside for you.”
Nothing I say can give you back those years.
“Ah yes, James. My men are fetching him now. I have already met the other two, Knight and… well, he refused to give us a name, but the very large one. You were the last to wake.”
Sherlock inclined his head in acknowledgement. “I hadn’t considered that.”
Sherlock leaned back, his hip hitting the stone behind him. The rock teetered and gave away, and he stumbled back, arms pinwheeling for purchase. There was nothing but air. He felt himself tilt over the edge and then an arm shot out and closed around his wrist. The man pulled him to his chest, setting Sherlock’s feet once more on solid ground. Sherlock dug his fingers into the man’s arm as he tried to shake the feeling of the world tipping around him. Once sure that the ground was solid underneath him, Sherlock loosened his grip. The man kept a firm hold on him and stared up at his face in wonder.
A murmur spread through the hall and he raised his head, peering past the nobleman who had been talking to him for the past fifteen minutes with no care that William wasn’t listening. His father had risen to his feet, goblet raised. The hall quieted.
And he tells his traitorous heart that that will have to do.
His brother clapped him hard on the shoulder after they finished completing the nest. Pride tugged at his cheeks and John wondered at it. Should he feel pride? These were his offspring waiting to be hatched. Surely he should feel something other than a resigned dread. He didn’t hate Mary; on the contrary, a part of him loved her dearly, but it was comparing a candle to the full force of a bonfire. It paled in comparison to what he had allowed himself to feel for the prince. His shoulders bowed with the feeling of wretchedness.
“Oh do shut up! If I had wanted a nanny, I would have brought Mycroft along.”
Sorry about the wait on this one. I was consumed first by mid-terms and then by the flu. Enjoy some bed sharing and a good, proper kiss, and feel free to come say hello to me over on tumblr. I go by the same nick over there as I do here.
Sherlock stiffened. “I was providing a distraction so she wouldn’t notice you shouting about a murder.”
He doesn’t recall leaving the building or heading down the street. London’s roar batters at him, but now he pays it no heed. Dealers are a dime a dozen in London and as he sinks into a deep haze of oblivion, he thinks that until now he had no idea what true loneliness felt like.
Sherlock gives John just a moment to test the length of the bonds before fetching a riding crop. He tests the bend of it in his hand, inspecting every inch of it.
flat, but it hadn’t been theirs in quite some time.) He never thought there would be a time when he wasn’t talking to Sherlock nearly every day, even if it had just been in text form. But then there had been Mary. And then Lucy, whose name even now made his chest ache. For awhile, his life was consumed with midnight feedings and slammed doors, doctor visits and too many bills, angry silences and tentative touches. He was a man of glass and each day he felt a new fracture.
I cannot imagine a world without a Watson in it.
Sherlock stopped swinging his foot. In the silence, the trees creaked and groaned around them. “Why?”
Even as he cursed himself, he showed up exactly when the boy told him to, half expecting to be stood up or jumped. But no, there he was: well-pressed shorts and clean dress shirt and turned up nose like he was trying to pretend like he hadn’t been eagerly waiting for John. He thrust a bag of cans into John’s hands as soon as he saw him.
“John.” Sherlock’s mouth hung open for a moment longer, then shut with a snap. With a quick jerk, he shrugged his coat up onto his shoulders and popped the collar.
As Sherlock pushes it in, the width of it flares, stretching him even further. A ridge catches on his hole and he quickly realizes which toy it is. A massive and ridiculously colored thing, ribbed all the way down and impossibly wide with a large knot towards the base. It looks more like something out of a fantasy wet-dream than anything from reality. He had purchased as a joke, something to tease Sherlock with. There is no way it will fit. Sherlock seems undeterred as he continues to slowly push the dildo into him. Panic flutters up John’s throat. It mixes in his mouth with the sharp tang of want dancing along his tongue.
His stomach clenched at the thought. Was that what all of this had been about? Had he just thought John was something to observe and record data on? He could just imagine Sherlock running home at the end of the day to scribble more notes in his notebook. Sherlock dissected and picked at everything. Was there a page titled Test Subject: John Watson in that notebook? Surely not even Sherlock would be that cruel.
“Results?”
As the sun slowly crept over the horizon, Mary slipped her hand into his. She felt as he did; she was a touchstone, a mark to return to and ground himself. Her finger, curved with small claws, did not feel as William’s would have and John took comfort in it.
John stopped short and turned around. He marched back towards Sherlock, grip sure on his cane. “Fine. All right. We’ll do it your way. You have one minute."
Sherlock leaves him like that, arms tied to the headboard, cock red and hard. Through the door, John can hear Sherlock move about the flat. In short order, he can tell that Sherlock has retrieved Rosie from her crib. He can’t make out the words Sherlock is saying, but John can imagine. Sherlock’s never been one for overly flowery baby words, and Rosie seems to love him for it. John buries the spike of jealousy deep; he isn’t sure who he is truly jealous of.
“Right, well, now that’s settled. I need a coffee.” John ran a hand through his damp hair. “Care to join me?”
“I’m not soppy-eyed.”
“My goodness, you two certainly put on quite the show.”
Sherlock took a quick step back and stared after her. “Well, that was…”
“It was a long time ago. Before you or your mum. He worked with the police and I helped him with cases. Eventually, we grew apart. It happens.”
“John, why are you here?”
Sherlock gave a tentative smile. “Thank you. Are you still working at that one clinic?” He gestured, the name obviously slipping his mind.
With little hesitation, he pulled Sherlock closer and began to suck. It was a welcome weight against his tongue, stretching his lips and cheeks around it. His jaw gave a brief complaint, but he ignored it, too driven by the sounds coming out of Sherlock above him. There seemed to be little he could do wrong as Sherlock continued his moan-filled litany of praise and his hips shuddered with the need to thrust. His entire body shook under John’s attention and John lavished it upon him. He sped up his hand on Sherlock’s cock, the way eased by spit, and kissed and licked every inch of Sherlock's skin he could put his mouth on. Sherlock let out a shaky breath which turned into a moan. His come hit John’s tongue, arced up his cheek, and across his lips, quickly making a mess of him. John brought a hand to his cheek, spreading the wetness there, and slowly licked his lips.
John bit the inside of his cheek. “Thanks.”
Okay, so John hadn’t had a whole lot of hope to begin with, but Emily had looked promising: leggy, blonde, fit, and, most importantly, a woman.
He screams. In his dazed state, the room sways: empty pool, a hospital roof, a locked room with padded walls. The smell of his own burning flesh grounds him in reality, briefly: a too cold room in Serbia, far from London and home.   The guard presses the red hot poker against his chest again, right above his heart.
He sat on the bed and fiddled with his buttons. How long did it take for John to clean himself? Surely he had been in there already for thirty minutes. Was it possible to drown in the shower? He’d have to do some experiments. John was a fit man, so it was unlikely that he succumbed to some as yet unknown illness. John was probably just taking his time. He was a fastidious sort. Years of military service and hospital shifts placed their mark on him. Since there was no rush, he was simply enjoying the luxury of a long, hot shower. Sherlock shifted on the bed. His skin tightened. The room was far too warm.
The word conjured the image of cramped alleyways and shared laughter, of being chased by dogs and overturning bins and tentative kisses. It sounded like home.
am back.” A grave opens before him, yawning and waiting to swallow him whole. He clings to the pain in John’s voice. He can fix this. He can, if only John gives him a chance.
“Sherlock was-- is impossible. Bit like trying to bottle lightning. Brilliant, but terrifying.” He shakes his head, even as his mouth turns into a fond grin.
“An experiment, then.” Sherlock gazed at him, hope lining the wrinkles just starting to form around his eyes.
“That’s it?”
“I thought as much. Perhaps time will dampen your temper.” He began to chant. The flames snuffed out and a blanket of cold rolled over them.
“Wait. That’s not necessary; I can manage on my--.” The bellhop scurried away with his bags before John could attempt to snatch them back. John bristled. He didn’t need help and he certainly didn’t like someone he didn’t know touching his things. Hopefully they wouldn’t try to put anything away.
“Oh yeah, because I love smelling like dog piss.” John had been covered in all sorts of filth; years of serving as a military doctor had all but ground out his disgust of bodily fluids. Human bodily fluids. If he wanted to get up close and personal with a dog’s nether regions, he would have gone to veterinary school.
Soldiers, clad in the same armor as the ones he had just killed, chased town’s people through the streets, herding them towards the river. Fear clenched his stomach. Where the group he had just dealt with had been disorganized, this force fought as well as any seasoned unit. He had fallen for a trap, laid by some unseen hand, and now the humans were paying for his distraction.
“I weighed the odds of you hitting me versus you being intrigued by the offer and from what I knew of you, the likelihood of hitting me was slim.” Sherlock glanced down at John’s curled fist. “Though I may have miscalculated.”
John ignored him. The knowledge that James was right did nothing to soothe the hurt. John knew of duty and the way it weighed on your shoulders, but what his mind might argue, his heart could not abide.
The answer is nothing.
A heart weighs eleven ounces—  give or take. Variables can impact the weight of it, the shape, the function Lifestyle. Sex. Illness.. But, on the average, a human heart weighs no more than eleven ounces.
Christ, I didn’t miss this.
John froze. That wasn’t the first time he had been caught, but he hoped that it wouldn’t be like last time. They had called the police on him and he had only barely managed to get away before they arrived. He had lost four bags that day. But it wasn’t an angry faced adult staring at him. It was a boy, eyes scrunched up in careful study of his actions. John licked his lips and slowly stood to his full height. His fingers twitched in anticipation. If he needed to run, he refused to leave the cans behind this time.
The first call came in at 6:15: explosion in Kensington, all hands on deck. Lestrade wrenched the steering wheel of his police car and pressed down on the gas. His tires spun for a moment, trying to find purchase on the wet street, before catching and propelling him forward. Beside him, Sherlock grinned, wide and a bit manic.
“Such as?”
It took them far longer than John would have liked to get to Sherlock’s house. By the time they arrived, Sherlock had gone from green to white and looked like he was ready to sit down and never get back up. Luckily John was saved from dragging Sherlock into the house. The front door opened just as they reached the porch. Suddenly it was a whirlwind of activity: Sherlock’s mother clucking her tongue in worry; Sherlock’s father racing to find the keys; everyone being shuffled into their car.
“I thought I’d see how you were.”
“An explosion in the richest neighborhood in London? Oh, someone knew it was my birthday.” He smacked the doorframe as if he could urge the car forward faster. In the cold cast of the streetlights filtering through the passenger window, he looked like a wild rider, answering the call of the hunt.
Sherlock swings a leg over John and slowly works John’s cock into his arsehole. He rocks up and down, inch by inch, taking his time. When he is finally fully seated, he grabs a fistful of John’s hair and yanks his head up. “You come only after I have.” He gives John a hard smack for good measure and releases his grip on John’s hair.
“John—”
“But you miss him.”
“Obviously. Why?” The boy’s accent was far too nice to be from this neighborhood. Come to think of it, so were his clothes. Everything about him screamed doting parents and a public school education.
“Younger than she, blond, fit, and, most importantly, taken.” Sherlock continued to stare at his shoes. It wasn’t a complete lie. All of Simmons’ husbands had been younger and blond. She liked her men competent, but also willing to bend at her command. As for the taken part, well, what John didn’t know wouldn’t hurt him. “She has more sense than to seduce a man who is categorically uninterested in women, but a bisexual man with a male partner would appear to her as an appealing sort of challenge.”
James turned to him, his eyes wide and wild. For a moment, he looked nothing like the gargoyle who John called friend. His face was twisted in fear and rage, a wild and hurt beast. “John.”
John shook his head, rolling his forehead against his brother’s. “The outcome would have been the same. Or worse. You are not to blame for what happened.” John released his arm. Though so much had been ripped away from him, having his clan certainly eased some of the hurt. Peace settled on his shoulders. Though they still may be in danger, John had those he trusted by his side.
“Oh yes, big help you are. Sitting in the shade.”
“John Watson, you are currently in a bed with me, Sherlock Holmes, at a hideous little bed and breakfast. It is…” He glanced at the sun being cast on the wall. “About half past six.”
Far past time to move on. At least this time he is leaving London because he wants to. He is used to starting over. He’s done it before. Not the first time he has lived alone, but perhaps this time he will actually figure out what it means to live with himself with contentment.
“Very well, Murray.” The name tripped up John’s tongue. His brother grinned happily at the sound. If the distinction made him happy, that was all that mattered to John. “Go explore and report back. Just… don’t do anything I wouldn’t.”
“Right because you don’t want to look like a fool if you go accusing the butler.” John grinned.
John grimaces. “Cuts. More tired from whatever the hell they used to knock me out than anything.” He holds up a shaking hand and gently pats Mary’s hand where it still rests on his knee. “Besides, Mary can take care of me.”
“Don’t start.”
He was thankful when Sherlock’s weight finally settled on top of him because he could no longer feel Sherlock studying him, marking him, and filing him away in his memory for later contemplation. He buried his head against Sherlock’s shoulder as Sherlock settled between his legs, his cock already hard against John’s thigh. John breathed.
Sherlock’s eyes narrowed. “No.”
“As I said, it was an astonishing level of magic that sealed you away. Stronger than any I have seen before, in fact. A curse, if you will, sealed in blood that stated you and your kind would remain asleep until such time that the castle rose to the clouds. An impossibility at the time, but easily enough done now if you have the money to do so.”
John sighed, then took up a position to hide Sherlock from view. “How’d you know about him anyway?”
“He would have been all of ten years old when the first death took place.”
He sobs then, broken and empty, and grieves for a love that never mattered, for a life that never mattered.
Tentatively, Sherlock brought his arms up and looped them around John. So many new sensations to file away. John’s body ran hotter than Sherlock’s and his legs were hairier and rubbed pleasantly against Sherlock’s own. It was a pity that John wore a shirt to bed. So much of his skin was still hid away from Sherlock’s gaze. He had barely glimpsed a flash of skin when John had stretchd before heading to bed and in that flash, he noted that John had a trail of dark blonde hair that led from his navel down past the edge of his pants. Sherlock forced down a shiver. Tentatively, he pulled John closer and closer still. John acknowledged the shift with a slightly louder snore. His breath warmed the patch of Sherlock’s skin that John had claimed as his pillow. Was this what it was like to actually sleep with someone? Sherlock would gladly take being woken in the middle of the night by elbows being thrust into his ribs or a little snoring if it also meant John would allow him to be this close.
“Damn.” He shoved his bag into the fridge, not caring if half the things didn’t need to be kept cold, and pulled out his mobile.
“Yes.”
John shakes his head. “Just a little smoke.”
He’s back in Serbia. Back in an alleyway. Back on the roof. Smith laughs and laughs, rattling around in Sherlock’s head as John hits him again. He tastes blood on his tongue and his vision blurs. In between hits, he hears John’s breath come out in ragged gasps.
John tossed the scrub brush aside and tugged his boot back on. It took a bit of wiggling and bouncing and he was certain he heard Sherlock give a quiet huff of laughter, but he was a soldier, damn it, and he wasn’t going to be the butt of a joke. “Never going to get the smell of it out.”
Sherlock chuckles, deep and free, into John’s shoulder as John tries to get a bit of mashed potato out of Sherlock’s curls. “We’ve made a bit of a mess.”
Dark magic swept over them. The cold of it burned. John could not outrun it, not as hurt as he was, and in the chant he heard his own demise. John shoved James away from him and screamed for him to flee. He stretched one hand out toward William. He could still save him. He
“I never mention my army buddies, either.”
Sherlock looks up at him, eyes gentle. “Yes, well… I suppose it is fair to say I have loved you for equally as long.”
“Sherlock, I can’t be the reason why you stay clean.” He thumped his cane against the floor. “I’ve got my own problems.”
“Why are you walking so funny?” Sherlock had stopped just up ahead and was considering him with a frown.
Sherlock failed to resist the siren song of the bed for long and, with careful movements as to not wake John, he settled on the mattress close enough to feel the heat of John’s skin, but not touching. It’s strange, he thought. He’d never been one for simply staying in bed. He’d rather be up and doing things, but the quiet puff of John’s breath and the way his face relaxed in sleep was hypnotic. He allowed himself the luxury of tracing John’s wrinkles with his eyes. Perhaps it was inappropriate to stare; John would be irritated by the invasion of his privacy, surely, but Sherlock had never been one for appropriateness.
A woman gasped nearby. The two of them turned to see an older woman, clutching a basket to her chest. When John met her gaze, she turned pale and made a sign to ward evil off before darting away.
He loves him. God, he does. But it’s not enough. Not anymore.
The primal part of his brain screamed at Sherlock to get away, to run, but his curiosity won out. The glow of his eyes died and for the first time Sherlock could see the dark blue of the man’s eyes. The deep rumble emanating from his chest died and he moved closer still to Sherlock. Great huffs of air came from his nose, reminding Sherlock of a bloodhound on the scent of a killer.
“Yes, friend. Put him down.” He rested a hand on James’s arm and gently pushed down. James sagged and the guard fell from his grasp.
“I wasn’t going to hug you.” John reeled back and hid his hands behind his back as if Sherlock were suddenly a very large and very hungry shark.
“And to think you were just angry about lying and there you are doing it yourself.” Sherlock’s face fell and, to John’s horror, a tear slipped down Sherlock’s nose. “I should have known you’d be like the others.”
Sherlock’s heart continues its relentless death march, even as John’s steps echo out of the room.
Tremaine held up a hand. “Hold. It’s one of my men I sent on ahead.”
After that it is easy to keep John tipping one way then the other, until he is tipping back, back, back onto the bed. He gives John no chance to breathe, no chance to think. He yanks hard on John’s trousers, stripping them off his legs, manhandling him into the position he wants John on the bed as he does so. Next come his pants. The waistband elastic tears as Sherlock mercilessly pulls them off his body. When John sits up to protest the treatment of his clothes, Sherlock grabs him by the throat with one hand and squeezes. Not enough to hurt, but enough to silence him. Air is harder to come by, slipping in small whispers into his lungs. John’s cock twitches in his pants. Sherlock tightens his grip and pushes John back down onto the bed. His weight insures that what little air John could take in is cut off. He holds him there for a beat, fingers flexing on either side of John’s throat.
“Ah.” Sherlock shut his book and set it aside. “The LARPing, I think.”
“I couldn’t tell you what was happening. You have to understand.”
“Fine.” He sighed as if it was the worst thing that could have ever been asked of him. “Something to do with the sciences, I think. Chemistry, perhaps.”
“Well, what do you have to say for yourself, young man? Upsetting my boy just before going on holiday. When I heard that you broke up, I nearly drove to London myself and done something truly monstrous.”
“Oh, right.” John held up the bag in his hand, nearly forgotten until just now. “I thought. Well, it being Christmas. I didn’t know-- Stupid, of course. Should have known you’d have something on.” He cleared his throat and rubbed the back of his neck. Should he have called? No, Sherlock hated to talk on the phone. Or at least he had. John’s gut tightened at the thought that he didn’t even know if that little fact was still true about Sherlock.
“There were other things on my mind at the time.”
“No? What do you mean no?”
“Ha! As if your portions would even begin to fill my belly. You are nothing but skin and bones, Goliath.”
John licked his lips. “Freckles? Yeah, that’s a fate you definitely need to avoid.” He hid his widening grin by ducking down and concentrating on a stubborn weed.
“Of course. Apologies.” Sherlock carefully studied the spot in front of John’s shoes. When next he spoke, it came out in a rush. “John, I was wondering if perhaps--”
“There you are.” John rubs his thumb along Sherlock’s cheekbone. He seems unaware of it, as if nothing feels more natural than his skin touching Sherlock’s.
Sherlock babbles as his heart kickstarts in his chest. Sherlock lets his fingertips explore the lines of John’s face, mapping the dip of his cupid’s bow, the rough stubble along his jaw.
His knees locked as his feet fused with the ground. Stone crept up his arm, freezing it as he continued to reach for William. The prince strained at his bonds and fought against the tight grip the man had on his hair. His gaze stayed fixed on John as if he could will himself across the intervening distance.
I am selfish. I am self-centered. Self-defeating.
The John he knew would have sneered at the lack of care. Too much time spent in the military and in the medical field had drummed a precise cleanliness into him. His room back in Baker Street had been painfully neat, from the carefully shelved books to the sharp folds of his bed sheets. But this… this speaks of a man who doesn’t care much for his surroundings and has no interest in taking care of it. Something ugly--something like grief-- twists in Sherlock’s gut.
“Might I offer a solution?”
“Last cat died. You hear ‘bout that?”
Sherlock bears it all. His hands shake as he tries to rise from his prone position. Another miscalculation. His life is becoming a series of unbalanced theories and shoddy thrown together plans. A hit in the bathroom before walking down the hallway now seems recklessly stupid. He’s taken far too much. The chambers of his heart stutter-skip, squeezing his life out in seconds. Hell yawns before him and pulls him down. Time and space warp.
“My god, you really bought that.” Sherlock grinned. “Amazing. One little tear and you go from wanting to throttle me to wanting to hug me.”
John quickly looked down. The front of his jeans was, blissfully, hidden for the most part by his coat.
Obviously John wouldn’t appreciate a hug and he certainly didn’t seem the type to want to talk about it. So, John needed a distraction. It would need to be something that would balance the scales, something that left John feeling less vulnerable. Ah, of course. Simple enough. He would confide in John and all would be well again. Sherlock’s mind skipped over possibilities. He fumbled for a moment then steeled himself. “You are the first person I have kissed.”
