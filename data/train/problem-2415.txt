Deanna is, abruptly, very sober. Her bones ache but it doesn’t matter in the face of the grace-high hissing through her teeth and down her arms, and Castiel’s got a hand against her throat, looking at her so closely, with that tilted head.
thing that’s happened to us since I stopped being dead.” Maybe they would’ve started hitting each other but something catches her eye, lightning arcing across the sky in the rearview mirror except it’s just the angel, blinking into existence. “Motherfuck – ”
Deanna shakes her head, snapping back towards anger, which is an easier emotion to feel than the desire to get down on her knees. “I’m not
Deanna almost turns and punches her, and wonders for a moment if she should just let Sammy go. Would she feel better? Would it be better, not to have to worry about Sammy picking back up another addiction? Would Ada follow her? Would Deanna be free on her own, travelling and running from angels? Would she be better off, less likely to say ‘yes’ to her apparently-huge role in the apocalypse, if her sisters weren’t around to be used as incentive?
Castiel stares at her, and something flashes, and the lights that were not already broken pop and shatter with sparks and screams. In the not-darkness and the shadow, something flares up behind her, and then there are wings, beautiful and horrifying, and Deanna does not kneel to anyone but for a moment she can almost remember the words of the Bible that Sammy whispers, the screams and the herald of God saying
Sammy’s quiet for a little while. Then she responds, barely a breath, “But there’s something wrong with Ada, too.”
Neither Sammy nor Ada have a good answer to this. Something falls off a shelf. Ada looks down at the notebook she’s sketching in.
“Holy motherfucking Christ on a bicycle,” Ada says, in a distinctly un-Ada voice, but Deanna’s too busy with the realization that air actually exists.
“Why on earth would I do that?” Crowley’s snort turns into cackling laughter. “You, darling, are the funniest thing that’s happened in
“Deanna,” Crowley says, drawing out her name in a vaguely sing-song way. “Leave him alone. He’s a means to an end. Now you two, on the other hand…”
Castiel looks down at the body she’s wearing, like she’s forgotten about it. “She was very devout,” Castiel replies. “An elder sister, like you.”
(There was once, when they were in Wyoming, when their father hadn’t been back home in a while. They’d been old enough to know why he was gone, but not old enough to wonder if this was the time he wouldn’t come back.
(Someday, Deanna and Gabriel will talk. Deanna will have drunk a frankly ridiculous amount of wine, and Gabriel will have cocaine and powdered sugar dusted across her fingertips and under her nose. None of the sisters who usually stop them from doing this will be there; neither of them would like to think about the reasons why.
“She is an abomination,” Castiel says, gently and madly. Her voice is hurting Deanna’s ears, rattling around at least three different sets of vocal chords. Sammy’s still crying, and Deanna doesn’t know if holier-than-thou Castiel has brought a contingent of more angels with her. Something blazes in her mind’s eye – the sigil Anna had shown them. Deanna tears open her palm because nerve damage doesn’t really matter anymore, and she draws it, gritting her teeth, and the maelstrom of which Castiel is the center flashes out of existence when Deanna slaps a bloody palm down the center.
“I tried,” Raphael tells her. For an all-powerful archangel, he seems fairly put-out by the fact that he didn’t succeed. He continues to insult the four of them in equal turns.
Deanna levels her a glare. “How long have you been getting that demon blood in your system?” She feels the ache in her bones, the wish for alcohol and maybe, deep within, for the grace Cas would use to get her sober. “What’re you even trying to do with it, Sam, level up or something? Gonna become more demon than human, at this rate, Jesus.”
“Hey, hold on, the other one’s here, too,” the hunter says, putting a hand down on the table, like he’s finally figured out this is
Anna leans in close, their red hair falling against Deanna’s face. “Because you humans are so beautiful in your freedom.”
Getting the other vamps out works, until it doesn’t. Samuel and the Campbells find them, and surround them, and shove them into the room with the Alpha. All their ducks in a row. The Alpha’s barely strapped down, and Sammy snarls when they decapitate the last girl. So much for getting Samuel to trust them. Gwen puts a gun to Sammy’s head and the bullets fall right out. The building shakes. Sammy doesn’t even bleed; there’s hellfire in her eyes nowadays.
“Sam’s doing better, now,” Missouri says, although something in her eyes is dark and weary. “Ada picked up a few hours at the station tonight, so she’ll be back tomorrow. But how are you, hon?”
“I need to, uh, get away.” Ada looks like the whole talking thing isn’t her favorite either. Maybe it’s genetic. “My mom’s ex-boyfriend keeps checking on me but it’s, like, the kind that makes you want to put on a turtleneck shirt and never look in the mirror. And all my classmates look at me like I’m going to snap, and school is so dumb, like – nothing matters. Everyone I love is dead. I don’t care about fucking anatomy, you know.”
“Mom’s – mom,” Sammy says, her voice so very small. Deanna’s mad at her, so mad, but her limbs don’t even hesitate, carrying her over towards her sister. When she hugs her, they can both feel the sting. Sammy groans in pain, something burning, and the brand – Castiel’s handprint – on Deanna’s shoulder flares. Deanna just pulls Sammy tighter.
They light a circle of holy fire around the angel, Balthazar. He has silver flickering around him, if Deanna can even call it that, stitched across his skin like some kind of Frankenstein. He stands casually, but it is wrong. It’s always wrong, with angels. He raises his voice to catch Deanna, lurking in the shadows. “You could take me apart, righteous girl. You can see them, I know you can.”
been…weird, lately. They were better for a few months, but the demons are getting organized again. And like you said, weird weather, weird phenomena, stuff even I know shouldn’t be happening.” Her face twists a little bit. “Gruesome bodies, too.”
The thing was not shaped like a human, though as soon as she saw them Deanna wondered why she had ever thought they would be. She didn’t know enough about myths, about stories, about religion. That had been Sammy’s thing, all the history.
“Really,” Sammy asks, when Deanna pours some whiskey in her coffee. “You can’t run away from things forever, you know.”
Then out comes Ada, hair braided back, and next to her is Gabriel. Gabriel steps forward like she has no other choice. Gold and silver and black – they stand in a circle, graces snapping at each other, mingling and hissing.
She’s bent in half, trying to remember how to do things like inhale or talk, and then something clicks into place and she sucks in a gasp of air, unsure of how she ever forgot. This is when she starts taking stock of her situation – Sammy seems to be having a similar experience, and Ada is…Ada’s holding herself straight, standing in the middle of the field with her head tilted back and her arms spread out.
“Sheesh, tough crowd. Well, to put it frankly, I’m here because your sister sent me to find you. Rightfully so, as I can see.”
Then the moment passes, and the girlthing is just a girlthing, still staring. “I warned her,” she says, quietly and intensely. “I warned her not to look. It is not my fault what the foolishness of humans brings down upon themselves.”
When Cas arrives, slamming fists and knives and low, harsh, words into the angels, Deanna wonders how many times Cas will save her.
“No,” Cas says, “I will not teach you what it says, because you do not possess the necessary number of vocal chords.”
“Sit,” he says. He is the friend you greet in church, he is the man tucked in the corner of every library, he is the face you see before you slam closed the ambulance doors. He has a calm voice, and a nice face. He is the end of all things.
Sammy nods. She’s still speaking quietly, speaking subdued. Less like she had been after Lilith and more like…like she’s scared. “I’ve been reading the news. Countries in upheaval. Weather thrown off. It’s wild.”
, Deanna will reply. Incandescent with rage. She’s good at that, even though it’s not just her anymore, is it.
Sammy glances over in a surprised sort of way, like she’s not used to Deanna actually applying critical thinking to real-world situations.
Another car passes by, throwing light through the kitchen, across three sisters sitting silently around a table. Deanna blinks – rusted chains hang over Sammy’s shoulders, moths fluttering in the heavy darkness behind her. Deanna shakes her head – shadows on Ada’s cheeks that blur into faces made of teeth, her mouth crooked and bitter and flickering like a candle in the wind.
Deanna silently takes the proffered shovel and starts digging into the cold ground. Her bad knee aches in the cold and this is definitely going to make her back sore tomorrow, but she’d rather the pain than the unsettling nature of how it feels now when Cas’s grace trespasses through her veins. Cas perches on a huge cement statue – they must be in one of those old battlefield sites, from the Revolution or the Civil War – and watches. In the darkness, her wings arc vast and familiar over Deanna’s head; they blot out the stars.
Deanna reminded her. It had been exhilarating, bringing someone else in on this. Teaching them exorcisms and tricks, the runes and the right books to search.
“Good timing,” Deanna tells her little sister, once they’re in the Impala and driving away. “We sure we want to give this kid to hunters?”
"Oh, she’s somewhere in here. Haven’t seen her yet?” The Trickster glances around. “I wonder where she went! Maybe she fell down a rabbit hole. Or maybe she got out, left your two sorry asses behind.” She sticks a tongue out at them, bright blue. “Guess we’ll never know.”
Deanna leans her head against the Impala. She wishes, slightly hysterically, that Sammy wasn’t six inches taller than her. “Don’t leave.”
So Deanna goes to Bobby, because what-the-hell-else is she going to do. She gets a mouthful of holy water, finds Sammy in a hotel room with a girl, ganks a demon, and watches a woman’s eyes get burned out. And –
“Yes,” Ada says, like she actually has any idea what they’re talking about, which Deanna is pretty sure she doesn’t, considering she’s an atheist.
Deanna blinks at her, surprised. She can’t quite put a finger on this – why is this so familiar? Why has she had this fight before? Why does it sound like Ada’s lying, and yet being more truthful than she’s ever been, all at once?
Ruby makes an aborted scream and Sammy twists around in her seat, eyes going wide and eager. “Are you Castiel – ”
Balthazar says, eyes intent on Deanna and weeping silver tears, “Because I have seen my family corrupted by this power before, and at least I can try to spare my younger sibling.”
“Aw, Sam,” Magnus coos, while Deanna grapples with Bobby, who’s got a knife and a face so devoid of expression that it’s terrifying. “Isn’t so easy now, is it, without all the fun juice keeping you high in the sky?” Magnus says to Sammy. He cocks his head at Ada. “Finally got her a tattoo, though, so maybe you’re not as dumb as you look.”
Deanna watches her sister pour herself a glass of water, hands shaking. Sammy is far too quiet, and there’s a shadow around her that Deanna can’t focus on without making her headache worse. When Sammy tries to drink from the glass, it quivers bad enough that she almost drops it. Deanna stands up, taking it from her and then pushing her into a chair. Sammy flinches, and the bottom of Deanna’s stomach drops out.
They get pie at a diner and stay far away from the few other locals, who are eyeing them with justifiable hostility. Sammy’s on edge, jumping at shadows, and Deanna can’t focus for shit, not that she’s been able to for weeks anyway. She shoves down the urge to fight with Sammy, the urge to punch someone. They’re here to help these people. They’re here to help.
“Don’t go alone,” Sammy finally says to Deanna. It doesn’t sound like agreement. It sounds like disappointment.
With a whirling like the floor dropping out from underneath Deanna, Balthazar is lit from the inside, the bones and barely-flowing blood illuminated by the glow of the angelic weapons which he has sewn into the body. She knows what he means, instantly, intimately, how to undo the seams. Cas frowns, but it’s pensive. Deanna is stuck, pinned to the floor. The singing has quieted, and in its place the silence is more terrible.
He keeps going, smiling in an uncomfortable way and glancing back at his buddies. “Heard about this one down the grapevine. Maybe we oughta put her down for good. Take another freak out of the world.”
“You found God yet?” Deanna asks. What a weird question. It sounds like something a preacher would ask you, or one of those big billboards –
. That she is Michael. The obedience to the father, the anger at the sibling, the unflinching loyalty and the ability to ignore the discomfort at the orders one is given. This is within them both.
Cas turns back to the three sisters. “I must go,” she says. She reaches out a hand, and for a moment Deanna loses her breath as Cas’s small hand brushes across her collarbone, but Cas turns the caress into a careful snatch of the amulet. Then she’s gone.
Sammy’s barely coherent, and Deanna kind of doesn’t want to know if her eyes are actually steaming or if that’s just a trick of the light, but she mumbles something when they move her. Ada’s quiet, face white and clutching her wrist.
glad to see you,” Deanna tells the dark-haired angel when she shows up, ruffled and slightly bloody. Even Sammy agrees, and Cas and Sammy usually have a pretty passive-aggressive relationship. This says a lot about the craziness of their lives, currently.
She cuts the weapons out of him. Slices along the grace-stitches, tears open the body he wears. It’s not the first time she’s done this, she doesn’t think. She can’t think.
“She’ll be ok,” Deanna tells Sammy, and herself. She tries to avert the what-ifs – Ada can take care of herself, wherever she is. Maybe Jo had called her up.
and some days she will sleep for two hours total and some days she will sleep from five am to midnight. She’ll throw herself at monsters with a feral viciousness, more akin to a wild animal than to a human, and forget that she can’t just heal her body anymore. She’ll grumble as Ada stitches up her wounds, but collapse like a tiny ragdoll in Sammy’s arms.
, Sammy said. She said it like she was spilling her blood on the ground for it. Deanna didn’t know it at the time, but she was.
“Little violent, there,” Ada observes. It’s judgmental and younger-sibling-ish and kind of annoying, which, they haven’t even known her that long.
? “Don’t you see? It’s not God, giving the orders. It’s just your bosses pulling the wool over your eyes, pulling strings so they can raise Lucifer. All they want is war, Cas. War, and suffering. Is there anything better to die for?” She hesitates. “Please, Cas.”
Deanna hated that. Deanna didn’t want to be a thirteen-year-old with a knife under her skirt and a figurative lollipop in her hand, smiling blithely and ignoring the stares of the men who thought her curves were too mature for middle school. Deanna hated being bait, hated the way even John looked at her differently when she was all dressed up.
They order their food. Deanna sits back, and she explains it all. She yanks off her jacket, and rolls up her sleeve – the handprint and the wings, which are sooty now, white and oddly blistered. She talks about the end, about the war between Heaven and Hell, the uptick in demons and the reason that the world they live in now is a wilder, harder version of itself. And then she leans back, and quietly recounts the past few days. “So we’re back,” she finishes. “And we shouldn’t be. And we don’t know why, because Cas – our angel friend – won’t pick up the damn phone.”
Sammy crouches down and reaches out to brush the ash. She twitches. “I guess this explains why the ghost behaved sort of like a poltergeist. I don’t know what the logistics are of an angel burning out themselves and the vessel, but not the original soul.”
she didn’t know she was queer, or whatever Sammy calls it, but the taste of the grace is like a high and this one is so good and Anna is so
. “We’re gonna just, you know, go now.” She picks up the baby and slings Sammy’s gargantuan limbs across her shoulders, and hightails it out of there before any of the Campbells can react.
Sammy says warmly, except it’s not Sammy. Lucifer in Sammy’s body is something Deanna knows will haunt her nightmares – the full white ensemble, so unlike Sammy’s jeans and acid-washed church shirts, the evenly shining smile, so unlike Sammy’s crooked grins.
, at least not as much as Sammy is, so it’s a little strange even beyond the whole demon-in-the-room. Ruby eats her burger fast, same as Deanna, instead of talking. Sammy’s got a salad and a complaint about their latest dead end of Lilith-research, but Ruby interrupts her to say, “Fries.”
A silly accident. That was what she told Sammy. That was what John told anyone who asked, the few weeks after it’d happened while it healed, gross and peeling. She’d been clumsy. She’d been stupid. She shuddered, just drunk enough to relax herself into something approaching vulnerability.
The body that crashes to the ground is not Ada, not anymore. Ada, Deanna remembers desperately, is not Michael’s true vessel. Michael’s grace is seeping out her – their skin, pouring down their cheeks like radioactive blue blood, eyes full of light that promise nothing but annihilation. Blonde hair swirls like the rays of light extending from saints’ heads in old iconography, like a halo, and they are covered in gore as Ada’s body falls apart at its very seams.
They are both correct. Crowley is the only demon Deanna has met that has maintained a body this long, other than possibly Ruby. Said body is, more or less, a well-dressed corpse, though out of the corner of one's eye it is hazy like fog under parking lot lights. He smiles smugly at Cas, revealing a mouth half-black, and Cas bares her teeth at him in return.
Ruby’s there then, and Sammy’s yelling at them to stop but Deanna can’t stop, not now. She loses herself in the exhilaration of it, the way it brings sharpness back into her world. She wonders what her dad would say, seeing her fighting alongside a demon, but then she remembers dad telling her that she might need to put Sammy down, too. She and the demon slam heads into tables, and Deanna loves this, loves knocking down men a foot taller than her who think because she’s a short girl that she can’t fight, loves the sting of it in her fists and loves the pain of it –
She got used to the hard look in his eyes, though. She got used to stepping around certain topics. She knew the right things to say to keep her father looking at her happy. Keep her father looking at her like he approved of her. Keep her father looking at her like maybe he loved her. Sometimes.
But America had always had a wildness to it. It shone through in some of the indigenous stories Sammy had read about, when Deanna sat down to listen, but those were stories of a more beautiful place. The America now destroyed everyone differently, yet everyone had to survive all the same. The America that Deanna and Sammy had been raised in was the kind of place that John fit best in, a country built by lonesome souls and muffled voices. The two of them feral and forever-running, one foot out the door, a knife in their hand and a prayer on their lips. They weren’t what America was quite trying to destroy, but it would all the same.
When Deanna does, there’s a grace-kick in her lungs, all of a sudden. She’s starting to wonder if she’s any better than Sammy after all, in the department of addictions that should not be theirs.
Deanna takes a deep breath and pulls Sammy’s arm around her shoulder in one quick motion. The splitting pain in her head gets worse, threatening to overwhelm her. “C’mon, you big lug.”
Deanna, for a moment, cannot understand it. Cannot understand this celestial being, who still stands next to her and tells her that she deserves redemption. Cannot understand this girl, who still stands next to her and has rebelled against everything she’s ever known.
Deanna chokes on a bite of pancake, thinking of Cas and the Enochian scarring on her chest. “Probably,” she replies hoarsely. The pain in her head worsens; she grips the glass of water in her hands, feeling the damp coldness. She needs a drink. An
“Get out of that girl,” Deanna finds the voice to say, but she’s not certain of it. There’s something flickering around the girl’s edges like the air above asphalt on a hot summer day.
Gabriel, having gotten very close to Deanna without her even noticing, snorts. “Like calls to like.”
“Deanna,” Crowley says. “Sometimes people are just people. You’ve been hunting so long you’ve forgotten: sometimes people are just people, and sometimes they’re just horrible.” He snorts. “Otherwise,
“If you’re all done lollygagging,” Bobby says, looking equally disgruntled, though on him it is certainly more well-deserved. They all glance up at him, all guilty – all for different reasons. “Ellen called. Town full of demons.”
Deanna loved her father. Really, she did. It was just that she loved her sister more. She didn’t think she cared about being a little monstrous when it was for Sammy.
Deanna hated him for it a little, too. Her sister was so full of light. She wasn’t allowed to make herself small like that, not for anyone.
She doesn’t get to finish, though, because Victoria’s eyes go wide and she yanks out a gun, flicking off the safety, giving Deanna just enough reaction time to duck before she pulls the trigger.
"No,” Cas says coldly, but her fingers are gentle on Sammy’s face. “She is unclean. It will reject my grace.” She turns to Deanna. “You are vulnerable now, with Adamine too. Be careful, Deanna.” Her eyes shine with a horrible light, with grace. Deanna wants another taste of it.
Deanna hadn’t even realized she was humming until she notices it’s the same song in her head. With the watered-down shelter of the amulet around her neck, she can hear it as one coalescing hymn. “I can’t get it right.”
(Deanna had never understood what hunters said about America. John always waved it off, said they were talking nonsense, said
Sammy’s twitching, gesturing wildly with her hands as she talks about a Sumerian legend, about descending into the underworld. The dye isn’t really sticking in her hair, not with how dark it is. She’s not quite Sammy but at least she’s there.
Deanna hates talking about her emotions. “Look,” she says. “Can’t we just…go back to normal, like we did before? Fine, maybe you’ve got psychic powers now. But still.”
Deanna snarls, trying to cover how scared she is. “The foolishness of – she was a good person, you bastard.”
Deanna chokes out a laugh that sounds like crying. Aren’t they? Mustn’t they be, in some way? Or was all that pain worth nothing?)
Deanna doesn’t want to believe that Cas is a traitor. She spends the whole car ride back to Lawrence arguing with Sammy about it. “What’s she even a traitor to?” She asks. “It’s not like there’s
They will all carefully avoid what else Sammy and Cas’s bonding time during Deanna’s Death-chase had resulted in. They will all carefully avoid what happened next.)
Lucifer-Sammy doesn’t stop her, just watches. They don’t seem to mind; they always liked the bloodshed.
Deanna puts a syringe next to his eyes, then changes her mind. Better just to dig them out, and let him choke on holy water instead. She’s so full of pain, and anger, at everything. At Alistair, at John – at both, for she knows Alistair is just repeating what John used to say to her, because Alistair knows how to get under her skin. Of course she’s a monster. They made her a monster, her and Sammy both.
,” Victoria draws the word out. “Can we get back to the case? Not to interrupt…whatever this is, but right now we have, you know, slightly more important business to deal with. An angelic weapon, you said?”
Deanna closes her mouth. John always told them never to trust men. Deanna doesn’t know why she’s surprised that this should’ve included him, too.
"What, you think they meant it symbolically? Metaphorically?” Deanna tries to make it a joke, but it comes out flat.
,” Sammy-Lucifer – no, just Sammy – hisses out, as a pit of swirling blackness opens beneath them, as it screams and cries out because Hell has always been a mouth full of pain and a door slammed shut, because
“Girls,” Samuel says to the three of them when they return in a vaguely condescending tone, which only serves to remind Deanna of some of the remarks John used to make. “I see you were successful.”
and then something clicks into place and she sucks in a gasp of air, unsure of how she ever forgot. This is when she starts taking stock of her situation – Sammy seems to be having a similar experience, and Ada is…Ada’s holding herself straight, standing in the middle of the field with her head tilted back and her arms spread out.
“But you don’t want to be just another pawn.” Balthazar laughs, back to being an angel playing with the body of a man in a v-neck and tight jeans. “As if you aren’t already.”
“You’re the new King of Hell,” Sammy says to Crowley, with some surprise. Maybe she can smell it or something.
"Hey, Cas,” she says aloud, her voice rough and cracking. She clears her throat. “If – you know. If you can hear me. Be good to hear from you, dude. ‘m kinda worried. And, you know, got some questions.” She lowers her voice, no louder than a whisper. Like the kid she never got to be, telling secrets at a sleepover. “I should be dead. I don’t know why I’m not. Why either of us aren’t.”
Life speeds up a little bit after that. The Winchester sisters stay well away from the Campbells, and despite Ada’s – and Deanna’s – reluctance, they hunt down the Alpha shifter for Crowley, and keep an eye out for more. Bobby isn’t happy about it, but Rufus gives Deanna and Sammy a nod when they tell him, and offers to help. It’s the right thing to do.
Deanna’s so, so weak. She keeps saying no, but it’s getting harder. She’d give up the world for Sammy or Ada. She just never wanted to have to.
Sammy’s still as a statue, in the seat next to her. “I might go read,” Sammy says. She stands up from the table a little shaky, shoving her chair back and standing still for a moment as she tries not to black out.
Deanna says. Her eyes are cold. The angel wings on her back are scarred over, as if someone took a knife to them. Maybe she did. Seems like something she’d do.
, Deanna thinks. Just an angry bald man. An angry and ugly bald man. God, Deanna can’t believe they’re related.
their lives. Then Sammy’s phone dings and the moment is broken, and she says abruptly, “I’ll be back in just a minute.”
“Symbols carved into them. Back, usually, but sometimes stomach. It’s too consistent to not be a pattern.”
The girlthing does finger-guns at them, and then hops on her bike, and then she bikes straight into the lapping teeth of the cold lake, out towards the fog and the freighters. The three sisters stand there for a moment and watch. Deanna feels very much like the singular time she tried acid.
, but she mostly just wishes, privately and to herself, that she’d already given in to Michael. That Bobby too didn’t have to sacrifice himself because Deanna’s too weak. Also that she didn’t have to see a picture of Crowley frenching with her sort-of-uncle.
That’s also around the time the windows start shattering. She claps her hands over her ears and then screams without realizing she is screaming, wonders if her blood will sizzle when it hits the dirt and this will all be just another punishment –
Death’s ring is far away, with Bobby, with her sisters. Ada had told Deanna, just a bit – the amount of demon blood Sammy would have to drink in order to power Lucifer. How Lucifer might already know about the rings, in fact. How Detroit was set in stone. How everything was set in stone.
looks at her. Her hair’s cut closer to her chin, now, wavy and brown and kind of messed up. Her nails are still a chipped black, which is and has always been the only constant in Deanna’s life so she’s kind of glad for it. And Sammy’s tall of course, that runner’s build that she’s always harping at Deanna about, but more than anything she looks tired, and twitchy. She looks, Deanna thinks, far too much like she’s waiting on a fix.
Deanna and Sammy don’t even know where all of them are; Ada hid some, in places she won’t tell them, and Bobby hid the others. Cas stares at Deanna, looking betrayed. Deanna stares at the ground. She hates this. She hates this.
After Jesse is gone, they walk back to the Impala. There’s tension, between Cas and Sammy, and Ada is talking loudly about something or other – some story her mom used to tell her about the Tooth Fairy. Deanna’s glad it’s getting easier for her to talk about her mom. She wishes she could think about John without recoiling.
. Deanna will sort of understand, in some ways, because she’s not humble. They’ll have saved and destroyed the world again and again. She’ll welcome the darkness, welcome the myths. Humans can be monsters too, after all, especially when they’re raised as killers. They’ll stand back to back: a girl who takes
“Hold on,” Jo says, and Deanna can’t believe how nice it is to see him. He’s got a new tattoo, curling up his neck, and Deanna wonders if Ellen okayed that one or if it was done out of spite. “This is cool and all, but who the fuck is she?”
Zachariah flicks his hand, and several other angels march into the alley, bodies stiff and warlike. They grab Deanna, and she yanks her arm away but does not, exactly, resist. “What are you going to do, Castiel?” Zachariah asks. “You’ve almost fallen, haven’t you?”
(Someday, Deanna will sit down next to Sammy. Sammy holds an icepack to her eye, and Deanna’s got a broken arm.
Cas will shake her head and then look guiltily at Sammy and ask for something small, still not able to stomach the overwhelming taste of it all. She’ll forget to drink water for hours on end and then faint –
Ada’s got hard, even eyes, nowadays. There’s pretty ribbons braided into her hair. Deanna wonders what would have happened to her, in another world. Would she have finished school? Would she be a doctor? Would she have a life? A family?
That had been a lie. There was nothing about ‘want’ in a hunter’s life. A hunter didn’t really want to be a hunter, just like a girl sometimes didn’t want to be a girl. They did what they could with the weapons they were given.)
Deanna squints at her. Cas is holding her off the ground and against the brick wall with ease, and there may be bruises on her throat tomorrow, but Deanna can’t find it in herself to care. Instead she looks at her angel, whose hair is a mess. Deanna’s never looked at her eyes so close like this – they’re Jamie Novak’s, kaleidoscopic and crystal, but they’re Cas’s too, that unearthly blue. “Are you
Sammy pulls Ruby closer. It puts a bad taste in Deanna’s mouth, but the guy twitches, and Deanna notices that there’s more of them, crowding behind him, standing up from booths. She glances up, meeting Ruby’s eyes across the table. Deanna doesn’t like the demon, probably never will, but if worst comes to worst Deanna’s pretty sure right now they’ll be on the same side, which is to say, on Sammy’s.
Maybe, she thinks, that wariness isn’t just because he knows her rules. For a moment, she thinks that wariness might just be because of her, and she’s just buzzed enough to enjoy it. “Didn’t stick,” she replies.
she’d still had her father’s voice in her head, rather than an angel’s. She’d still been concerned with things like that, because it was easier to be concerned about that than her impending death.
Deanna could see him fitting in there – flashing lights and dancing crowds and haunting in the way that empty parking garages were at night. And Jo, skirt spinning over his stomping boots and lanky boy-limbs.
Yeah, Deanna remembered. Sammy had looked so little in the bed, pale and bruised. It had been Deanna’s fault.
The first one out is Castiel. Michael-Deanna’s eyes alight upon her, because she is a curious case, because for them to look upon her is to see something warped –
Sammy doesn’t stop her from torching the bones, but as the sparks catch, she says, “Requiem aeternam dona eis, Domine.”
Gabriel watches Deanna, standing illuminated at the front of the alley. Zachariah’s really dead this time, his body laying on the ground amongst the litter and the rotting food. The burnt outline of his wings on the ground is edged in silver, but already puddles are washing it away; there’s a metaphor in there, somewhere.
Cas doesn’t even stop, just reaches out and touches two fingers to Deanna’s forehead. The world flashes by at dizzying speeds, lighting something in Deanna’s memory that brings her headache back full-force when they land.
Cas coalesces out of starlight and the smell of thunderstorms, out of rain and electricity and indeterminable things. “I do not exist at your beck and call,” she says.
Deanna because she’s cruel and because she breaks everything she touches, replies, “So what about that poor girl’s soul? Sam was wondering, you know, and I was too, how different it was from demonic possession. What games do you play to make them say yes?” Castiel’s an angel wearing someone’s body like a spare shirt so it’s not like she ever reacts, not even the twitches or tensing that Deanna would go off with Sammy, and Deanna goads her, saying, “Heaven’s weapon, didn’t you tell me? Isn’t it funny that you guys have to do the same thing the demons do? Is it humbling, in any way? We get to walk around in these bodies, and you guys all just have to
"The world has changed,” Ada says. “Just ‘cause the apocalypse was averted doesn’t mean – doesn’t mean everything went back to the way it was.”
“Oh, Deanna,” Alistairs says in the barn. He’s in the body of an old white man, the kind who’d try and stick his hand up Deanna’s skirt when she was little. “Oh,
, and Deanna wonders if this girl will ever be fully human again. “She had something to tell you, I think, but I don’t know what it was.”
“Good choice,” someone says from the backseat, and apparently Deanna’s body has adrenaline left to give, because it shoots through her veins. A car honks at them as they swerve and she instinctively checks that Sammy’s still asleep, which is how she notices that it’s Anna in their backseat.
Things become very loud, as Gabriel screams out a word that frees the seraph and Ada, as Lucifer-Sammy’s eyes grow hot and wrathful and suddenly very
“Yeah,” Deanna finally agrees, testing it out. She’s probably known since they came back, but she hadn’t wanted to admit it.
,” Sammy says. “For me.” Her eyes are too intense, not dark like a demon’s but bright and glittering, surrounded by smudged eyeliner. Her hands shake as she picks up a Bible stolen from a Target, purple highlighter throughout for Revelations research, the Rosary hanging around her neck.
Sammy would curl up in her bed some nights, curl up for warmth. There was hair all over her arms, all over her hands. It was what happened, when a body didn’t have enough fat to keep it warm. Deanna wrapped blankets around her and held her in her arms, hated how her brightness was dampened like this, hated how her ribs poked out. It shouldn’t be.
Samuel Campbell sells them out, which is unsurprising. Castiel goes to find Crowley’s bones, and Magnus is God-knows-where, and when Samuel comes up to the door of the cage they’ve put Deanna in, she reaches out and grabs onto his head. He struggles but she slams his head forward into the bars, slams it hard enough to hear his skull crack like an egg, lets the blood splash and bares her teeth at the last bit of surprise in his eyes.
“Deanna,” Cas says. She puts a hand over the mark on Deanna’s shoulder, which flares with heat. Deanna trembles, feeling the weight of many eyes staring straight at her. “You are the Michael sword. Though this is in part due to your bloodline, it is not just that. You are the Righteous Man, and you forget that it was I who found your soul in Hell. Even in the pits of the damned, you shone like a star. You have always been born to save others.”
The people in the camp mutter to each other. This world is so hopeless, so damned. Whole states have been destroyed in some kind of enormous war, and everyone’s got a hungry, skittish look in their eyes. Deanna feels completely alone, without Sammy or Ada tagging along, until Cas corners her one evening.
“I remember Hell,” Deanna tells Sammy, the words drawn out of her like rusty razor blades. “I remember it all.”
Famine gets Sammy with the demon blood, and Death gets to Ada with her mother, and Bobby shoots his wife. The world is falling apart, and they’re falling apart, and Cas is growing increasingly desperate in her search for God.
“We do all sorts of things for our family,” Michael says gently. Their voice is John’s, then Mary’s. It echoes through her head. There is no Zachariah to ferry her between, no angels in crisp suits. Simply her and the archangel whose voice she knows better than her mother’s. Their voice is warmth and song, light and laughter. It is horrible. It is everything she has ever known. That is the worst – that Michael is
“The technicalities, whatever, mean that it was then demon blood, enhancing her psychic shit,” Ada adds.
“Of course I don’t!” Deanna almost yells. The water of Lake Superior laps gently by her feet. It’s a serene location for a good, old-fashioned, Winchester-sister catfight. “But that doesn’t mean I’m letting you leave.”
“He sounds off,” Ada says quietly. She’s walking on eggshells around Deanna, more concerned that Deanna will be mad than Sammy, whose current attitude is oscillating wildly between repentant and
Deanna hates talking about her feelings. She hates it so goddamn much. She wonders if she can make this as short as possible. Wonders if she can make it vicious enough that Ada will leave. Does she want Ada to leave – no, she likes having another sister who doesn’t look at her like she’ll fuck everything up forever and ever, though Deanna’s rapidly changing that. She hasn’t known Ada her entire life, but it still hurts to watch her hurt.
“You should both get some sleep,” Ada finally tells them, eyes flashing in the half-light of the kitchen. She sounds sad and tired. She’s the younger sibling; they should be taking care of her.
And maybe that’s the first time it occurs, this subconscious realization of the lines between them, fighting a war millennia in the making, demons and angels and Heaven and Hell – but she doesn’t know that, not yet.
“I don’t do girls,” Deanna says, because she has chronic foot-in-mouth disease, and also because she doesn't.
The Trickster shrugs, and picks up a glass that’s suddenly chock-full of pills. She knocks back enough to kill a normal person, and then turns to Sammy, the glass already refilled. “Want any?”
“Come on,” Ada says, voice shaking a little. “We need to get Sam out of here. I – Gabriel helped me put up walls in your heads, when you came back. So that you wouldn’t feel the torture. It was too bad for Sam, she couldn’t even remember English. Michael must have protected you, a little, but not Lucifer. The walls were necessary, De, you know you’d have done the exact same thing in my place.”
“In the flesh,” she replies, smiling wolfishly at him, but there’s a warning in her eyes, and wariness in his. She doesn’t let other hunters fuck her, and they all know this – she never gives them that kind of power over her.
“Fine,” Deanna admits, gruffly. “I’m…still a little pissed. But – I don’t blame you. It was.” She grits her teeth; she did, after all, break the first seal. And Ada did, after all, stab Lilith first. “A collective effort.”
Cas tilts her head at Ada. Ada steps back, and Deanna doesn’t fault her for it. The intensity of Cas’s eyes are not the only thing that shift her from heart-attack-attractive-secretary to Goddamn-angel-of-the-Lord, but the glow sure doesn’t help. “How curious,” Cas says. “Another Winchester.”
“It was like,” she swallows some of her sandwich, “like being chained to a comet.” She turns to Deanna, those eyes so
They talk for a few hours about what’s been happening. Bobby calls halfway through, except Rufus is the one who’s actually calling. He tells them that Victoria had gotten in touch, that the pair of them are going to start tracking Eve. Sammy, who seems to trust Rufus quite a lot more now that he’s actually working with Bobby, tells him what they know. Bobby hops on at the end, gruff as usual, and Deanna won’t admit it but even with how unsteady the whole world is, it’s good to hear his voice. His and Rufus’s, the crazy old bat.
Deanna’s hidden in the shadows. She knows the Campbells don’t know she’s there. When she steps out, it’s with a knife in her hand and the amulet wrapped in her other fist. When she tells Samuel to leave her baby sister alone, it’s dissonant. Her own voice grates against her ears, because it’s not quite her voice. The singing crescendos, and Gwen drops the gun like it burns. Deanna’s not used to being looked at like this. Like she’s something horrifying. Like she’s something
“Not everything’s about you,” Ada says. “So would you stop being self-deprecating for one goddamn minute?”
“Ok,” Deanna finally says, painfully. She did, after all, say yes to Michael, and technically, Sammy saying yes to Lucifer was her fault. She grimaces. “So is it…permanent?”
“Stop doing the freaky mindreading thing,” Deanna splutters. “You just said I deserved to go back to Hell!”
Deanna learned to sleep with a gun under her pillow, and always took turns too fast. Sammy learned how to skip meals, and then Sammy learned how to leave.
Gabriel sits them down, and explains the rings of the four Horsemen. Cas is knocked out for most of it, and Deanna keeps glancing at her. But Sammy’s serious, and Ada’s serious, and Gabriel is as serious as Gabriel gets, so they listen. Deanna knows this won’t work – Gabriel as good as told her. But she can pretend, for Sammy and Ada. They’ve already got two of the rings. She knows she’ll have to say yes, knows that there’s no other end to that, but maybe, possibly, she can trick Michael and Lucifer into following her back to Hell.
Dean’s quiet, still, at dinner. He makes pasta with the new groceries, and smiles when Sam says it’s delicious, but he’s not quite. . . Dean. Sam notices. Dean says he’s fine, even though he is clearly not fine.
Third, Cas had the neatest goddamn handwriting he’d ever seen. It was like an art form. Dean, who’s illegible scrawls had been getting him in trouble since second grade, was in awe. He spent more time watching Cas write than watching the professor.
He’s thought it, sure, in the heat of battle and in the most calm moments.  It’s surprising that he can even think those words at this point. Most of the time, thought, it’s a wordless feeling, like a pulse beating alongside his heart, over and over and over.  Dean knows he should tell Cas but- he just can’t say those three little words.
Then Cas comes out and brings a case of beer, slinging an arm around Dean’s shoulder.  Dean opens up the beers. He gives one to Dean, and one to Sam when he gets back outside. Together, Sam, Eileen, their son, Cas, and Dean watch the sun set from Sam and Eileen’s porch, ready for another day of forever.
Turns out Cas doesn’t wake up in the middle of the night. It’s about 9am before he even moves again. Ten minutes before he opens his eyes.
They stop for lunch by the time Cas is making decent turns at 15 miles per hour.  He still gets the turn signal mixed up sometimes, or presses the gas a little too hard, but he’s doing really well for only two lessons.  He makes sure to tell Cas that, and Dean can see the pride creep into his face.  He knows it’s on his own face too.
Later, Jack is put on dish duty. Sam seems to think this is a bad thing and offers to help, but Jack likes washing dishes. It makes his hands smell nice and feel soft.  He likes how easy and repetitive it is, and playing with the soap. He’s trying to learn how to blow bubbles from between his fingers like he saw on a cartoon. Dean had caught him once and said he was getting the floor messy, and Jack had asked how it was getting the floor messy if he was dripping
When they break apart, it’s a few moments before Cas notices Jack. He flinches, looks away from Dean.
Cas’ face looks like he’s more constipated than Dean was after Cas poofed him that last time.  Dean stifles a laugh.
By the time Mary, always an insomniac, ducks her head into Dean’s room again, Dean is asleep. Cas is listening to the tape, after Dean reassured him that it wouldn’t disturb his rest.
Sam laughs along with Mary and Bobby. Dean’s blushing like he’s never blushed before, but he’s not even mad. He deserves it, he supposes. He turns back to a squinting Cas.
His relationship with Jack has been rocky, but he does care for the kid- a lot. He let other things get in the way before, but he can’t let that happen again.  Not now, after they are the last people on Earth, after Cas made a deal and kept it a secret to save him.
There’s an old lady that’s been standing in front of the same jar of peanut butter since Jack asks his question. She hasn’t moved. Jack thinks she’s eavesdropping, but he won’t say anything, even though eavesdropping is rude.
“I love you,” says Cas, out of the blue. He does that now, too, like he can’t believe he gets to say it.
Sam helps him anyway, with drying and putting the dishes away. Jack’s glad, because that’s his least favorite part.
Castiel’s face scrunches in confusion, or mostly disgust.  Angels probably don’t have to excrete anything.  Lucky bastards.
“This-“ Dean brandishes the paper, “is a spell that will put you back to sleep.  If you give Cas back to me, all of him, just as he was before you took him, I’ll contact the Queen of Hell. She’ll confirm you held up your end, and then she summons you, you give her this, you’ll be out like a light for the rest of eternity.”
“I-“ Dean says, “that’s not- what I meant.  I mean, that’s part of it, but not really the main part, anymore, I guess- why am I telling you this?”
Dean holds Cas tightly and Cas is holding tight back, but it’s different than all their other reunion hugs on Earth or in Purgatory. There, Dean always felt like if he let go, the universe would tear them apart again, take Cas away again. But now the urgency is gone, the desperation. Now there is peace, now there isn’t fear. Now there is the promise of everyone together, forever. This is the last time he will have to reunite with Cas, because they won’t have to be apart ever again.
“Oh, that gender roles are a social construct and that unnecessarily gendering products is very harmful for everyone, especially transgender and genderqueer people, but-“
He’d left the door cracked open so hopefully people wouldn’t knock and disturb the recording, and he’s rewarded by a rush of cool air that announces Sam.
“Okay, Dean.”  Cas stares at the dashboard like it holds the secrets to all of time and space.  Dean can’t help smiling.
Except. Way back when, when his mother cut the crusts off his sandwiches and he wore shirts that said “I wuv hugs.”  He wasn’t angry then. He loved his dad. He loved his mom. He loved Baby Sammy. He didn’t want to kill anyone. Anything. He wasn’t angry. But that was then, and then everything happened-
Cas has barely appeared in the doorway, wearing what looks like one of Dean’s Led Zeppelin shirts, before Dean’s crossed the room, squished his face between his hands. He kisses him.
He looks back on his life, how he’s grown. How he carried his baby brother out of the fire that killed their mother when he was only four, had to grow up and raise Sam at the same time. How he stood outside Sam’s door for hours at 26, wearing his dad’s leather jacket to look tough, but standing there scared out of his wits that his baby brother wouldn’t love him anymore. He thinks about being 28 and faced with an eternity in Hell after he sold his soul to save Sam’s life.  He thinks about being 31 and watching his brother face the same predicament, only worse, and to save the world. He thinks about being 33 and losing the best father figure he had. He thinks about being 36 and a demon, his arm marked by an ancient curse. He thinks about being 38 and meeting his mom again. He thinks about being 41 and watching the love of his life die for the sixth time, without telling him how he felt. Again.
He made the deal out of love: love for Jack, love he said Dean taught him. Dean wants to be mad at Cas, at Jack- but he isn’t. The anger that’s been there all his life just- isn’t. Cas made a deal to save a boy he loved, and Dean Winchester would have done the exact same thing. He knows this as sure as he knows Cas is gone.
Cas nods to Mary, tentatively holding his finger to his lips like Dean did earlier.  Mary smiles and nods back. She walks away, not before catching a glimpse of Cas’ face as he watches Dean breathe evenly.
Sam was locked in the panic room, recovering from Famine’s demon’s that he’d drank dry, and Dean had just finished praying for mercy when Cas appears again.
“You sure? Cause we can take a breather- I mean, I know how traumatic dying can be, wow, that sounds weird, but anyway, I get it, so it’s not a problem-“
“Dean, it’s fine. Really.”  Cas takes a deep breath again.  “It just- for a second it felt like Chuck’s house did, before Raphael came.”
“Yeah, well.  I sorta blurted it out that time we drove to Maine to confront Raphael.” Sam looks confused.  “You weren’t there, we had ‘gone our separate ways’? Anyway, he asked and I just said sure.  Thought he’d’ve forgotten by now, to tell you the truth.”
Dean’s uncaring, I’ll-just-wing-it attitude kept him from too much stress, but he’d watched his classmates descended into madness with mild amusement.  He’d noticed Cas seemed mostly immune to the mania, until one fateful day.
“‘Cause I love my car, Cas.  She’s a cool car and I take care of her.  She’s the closest thing me- and Sam, normally- have to a home.”
“It will, it’ll get gas to the engine, but it won’t let you move forward.  This is just for practice.”
“Dean,” Jack tries again. “He.  Is.  In.  Love. With. You.” He says each word slowly and individually, hoping he can get through to Dean.
Dean has his eyes closed, so he doesn’t see Mary peek in the doorway. She takes in the tape recorder, the song (and it’s artist), Dean’s face.
“Cas, buddy, I don’t want to offend you, but it’s kinda creepy, okay? Can you please not do that next time?”
Dean does actually study- not as much as he should according to Benny and his nerd friend Kevin, but hey. And Bobby would kill him if he failed due to his own laziness. So he goes to the library.
“That came out wrong.  I just meant to ask why you came to find me.  Like, what you came to say.  That’s all.”
He drives, and he wants to be angry. He wants to be mad enough to hit things and bloody his knuckles and scream until his throat hurts and his eyes water. He wants to curse someone- anyone.  Chuck could work, but Dean knows it wasn’t Chuck who did this. It was Cas.
In the end, it’s his words that do it, mumbled into Cas’ shoulder. “I’m sorry, Cas, I’m so sorry. . .”
Cas looks around like he’s just now processing where he is.  He looks at the blanket pooled across his lap, at Dean’s desk, the window, and finally Dean himself. With the sunlight shining in, Cas’ eyes are the brightest shade of blue Dean has ever seen. Like when the sun hits a spray container of Windex through the window you’re cleaning- which is a decidedly unromantic metaphor, but Dean’s never claimed to be a poet.  But his eyes are like those blue Christmas lights shaped like snowflakes wound around snowy porches, or a drop of iodine turning a potato blue in that one Chem experiment, or-
“Oh,” Sam says. “I’m not quite sure.  I can’t know what goes on inside their heads, or why it’s been this long-“
It’s some time into forever before the other Dean Winchester reaches Heaven. It’s been a time of reconnection, of happiness and love, of making up for lost time in a little house with Cas.  Sam and Eileen live next door. Anyone else they’d want to talk to live not far away. Jack even visits every now and then, now that their story is over. He likes hanging out with them in Heaven, and Dean enjoys it too. Despite Jack’s new role, he’s still just Jack. He loves his mother and spending time with her, and he goes fishing with Dean and plays board games with Cas and drinks beer and discusses Star Wars with Sam.
“I love you too, you know” Dean bursts out, and he wishes he hadn’t taken so long to say it, but the past is past and Cas is here and they may have forever, but he can’t wait anymore. “I should’ve said it years ago, I should’ve said it then, but it all happened so fast and you were dead and I couldn’t-“ He has to stop for a breath.
“72.  Although it probably ended up being a few more than that.”  Cas says. He still looks a little confused.  He squints at Dean. “Thank you?”
“Sam?” Jack asks. “Han and Leia didn’t think the other person liked them either, right? But they still ended up together?”
Hasn’t he been angry since he was four and he was told his mother was killed by a monster?  Hasn’t that been what kept him going, what now fuels his every action whether he wants it or not? Anger that fueled the Mark, anger at every monster he’s ever killed, anger against Chuck that led him to pull a gun on Sam. Anger he can’t control. Anger that drove Cas away.
He gets up slowly. He bypasses the kitchen to go back to the library. He turns the corner to the shelf with the sword.
Dean sighs again. “Okay.  I believe you, about- Cas. And what you think you felt. But it’s still complicated.”
It lands on the book. Butterflies don’t have eyes, but Dean would swear this one looked at him like it could see straight through him.
After scribbling a note to Bobby, they head back to the lot.  Cas tried steering a bit last night, but Dean’s paranoia about the dark kept him from getting too far.
“Yeah, no problem Cas.  Anytime.”  Dean smiles back, and he’s staring into Cas’ eyes too.  He doesn’t look away.  At this point Sam starts feeling more than a little uncomfortable.
Dean’s always believed in that, if nothing else. And now his belief is confirmed and put into motion.
Jamie runs back to her family. Deanna feels like crying again when she sees Jamie’s little brother, Cliff, taken by Cas too. But here’s the thing. Ada still doesn’t have a damn anti-possession tattoo, and suddenly there’s demons, and Deanna’s grappling with her little half-sister whose eyes are black like jet. She doesn’t know where Sammy is but she’s pretty sure it involves Ruby, and she’ll deal with that after she’s figured out how to exorcise Ada cleanly. She gets a knife to the demon’s throat, and then –
“Maybe I shouldn’t have, though,” Sammy admits, softly, like an olive branch. Deanna blinks, and the darkness recedes from her nerdy little sister. “I mean, angels? The four Horsemen of the apocalypse? Holy
(The thing that gets forgotten, in the following days, is that Crowley and Deanna have a hesitant sort of understanding after this trip. But nobody likes talking about that, so instead they focus on the fact that Cas and Sammy come back no longer hating each other’s guts.
There is, indeed, an archangel in a ring of fire. He hisses and spits at them, and after they look at him for a little while Deanna calls Cas, who appears, takes one look at the fire, and flinches.
“God – ” Deanna leans her head against the window of the shitty motel room they have. “I’m gonna go get her.”
Victoria got possessed. Victoria managed to survive an encounter with Lilith, managed to kill her first demon only hours after learning they existed, managed to blow that building to hell and get herself out alive. Victoria turned every single do-good bone in her body into motivation for hunting, and Victoria had a punch like her fists were made of iron and a mind like a steel-trap. Every time Deanna ran into her, exorcising demons in wide swathes across the western half of the country, she had a new anti-possession tattoo. Like she’d never be able to forget that voice in her head.
This isn’t a question any of them can answer, nor do they really want to. Ada hangs up not long after that, which leaves Sammy and Deanna to uncomfortably avoid the topics that aren’t good for conversation right now, which is more or less everything. Bobby’s face is much easier to deal with than the archangels that briefly resided in their bodies.
There’s too much between the two of them. There will be a whole history, a decade of pain. The kind of pain that only the Winchesters could bring, and only to those they love.
“Yeah, and.” Deanna gestures. “Now we’re back. I swear to fucking God, Ada, if you sold your soul – ”
"You fucking idiot!” Sammy shouts at Deanna as soon as she comes in. “I can’t believe you – I thought you said we’d find another way!”
An acrid smirk washed over his face.  “You stopped calling me Castiel pretty quickly.  No need to be so formal, agent.  I dream about a lot of things.  The sensory information I took in on your side clings to my memory, so I’ve dreamt about the things we said we wanted to do together: visit a bakery, run through the neighborhood dressed in your sweats, plant trees in our small backyard,” he recalled wistfully.  “Other things.”
He pulled his chin up so their eyes would meet again.  “You know how we operate.  If there’s any chance of heading Covarrubias off at the pass and saving yourself, you need to give Ketch up.  Put faith in the justice system we have bled to protect.”
He snickered finally glancing towards the hallway, his heated cheeks on full display. “A’right, so are we watching this fine family programming or what?”
Every hunter in the room grew more impatient, tensing as the lines of the incantation bloated in the moldy basement air.  A dark swirl opaquely manifested, looming larger and larger over the downed witch who began to cry gleefully at her pet’s return.  The amply hirsute lead hunter returned to his position by the stairs, pointing his sawed off at the footfalls crashing back into the house and closer to the basement door.  Several sets of eyes all stared at Sam, unified in their will for him to just finish the damn incantation already when the basement door flung open and Don instinctively fired into the open space above.  Sam tried to soldier through the last line when the dark conglomeration above the witch switched from side to side and exploded into a blinding spasm of light that forced all of the hunters to guard their eyes from the onslaught.  To Don’s surprise the bloody, pellet-mangled second witch bounded down the stairs towards her sister and Chet caught her from behind, swiftly binding her to a pipe in the nearby furnace room.  Learning from their mistakes, he gagged her vitriolic yammering before she could utter any murderous incantations at their vulnerable backsides.  Sam returned back to the Cathryn after he saw her settle limply for the first time all night.  The familiar was long gone and the witch lay far too still for his liking.  It was however still enough for Dean as he leaned over and felt for a pulse.  With a near sorrowful shake of the head, he confirmed there was none.  They lost the witch, the familiar, and any chance of solving for witch’s murderous plot against the mayor of the small town.
Things don’t get better just because Deanna was honest with Sammy. If it’s possible, they get worse. Sammy looks at her with regret and pain in her eyes, even more so than usual, and it makes Deanna want to punch her. Instead, she goes out and punches other people, drinking down bars and drinking up attention and slamming fists into faces that are attached to bodies with wandering hands.
“Dad died,” she says, “long ago. My mom made a deal with a demon and brought him back. Mom died, and dad spent all that time hunting the demon down. Dad got killed by the demon. Sam got killed by the demon, and I made a deal at a crossroads with one to bring her back. I got a year. Sam got the rest of her life, although if she keeps hanging out with Ruby-the-demon-bitch, we’ll see if she doesn’t just throw it away.”
Sammy glances past her, eyes clearing momentarily. The touch seems to calm her, as much as it hurts Deanna, so she nods her head at Ada, who grabs the other arm.
They stop the car when the music in Deanna’s head gets too loud, when the fritz-veil becomes soupy in the air. Deanna gets out, feeling like she’s dreaming. It’s a new moon, and the sky is full of stars, and the dessert is empty and exposed. Sammy is shivering. Deanna throws her their dad’s old leather jacket – Deanna doesn’t know how to talk to her about food without fighting so instead she just keeps her warm. Anyway, the scars on Deanna’s back burn too hot for her to feel the cold much on her own anymore.
He looks down at the sleeping man. In, y’know, a non-creepy way. His hair is dark and messy, and he’s only a couple inches shorter than Dean. He had a little bit of stubble going on- product of the tests, Dean is sure. It isn’t completely hiding his jaw- that jawline could cut glass. And his ass-
Chuck falls. Dean can’t believe it worked. After years of running like a mouse in a maze, being played for multiple apocalypses- he can write his own story, his own ending. And Sam and Jack are there too. Well, Sam is. Jack decides to leave, and for the first time, it doesn’t feel like abandonment.
“Your dad talked a lot about you, you know. I feel like I know you too, but I know I’ll never be able to know you like I would have if I’d lived.”
“You’re Dean,” says Jess, so long ago. So, so long ago. (“You are way out of my brother’s league,” he’d said.  Casual. Like he hadn't stood for hours debating whether or not to come in and drag his little brother back into the mess. He’s still not sure he made the right choice. He’s certain he’ll never be sure.)
The ground is shaking. Why is no one reacting to the ground shaking? He sits, falls down on Jody’s couch, staring through his shoes at the black goo covering the floor.
Dean pushes away the memories of his mother that come at this phrase.  He’s pretty sure this is not what she meant, having a grown man watching him sleep like some sort of creep.
He wanders after his impractical guide for he doesn’t know how long, but then they reach a cleaning and the trees turn into the library at the Bunker. The butterfly is still there, blue wings stark against the ancient bindings.  The butterfly floats gently, gently, gently down the aisle and towards a book, laying open and face-down on the ground, on the shelf by the sword.
Bobby is there, and he drinks a crappy beer and hears of how Heaven has changed. That the walls are broken down and Heaven is a place to make new happy memories instead of reliving the old ones. That his parents are there and live together, and everyone is together and everyone is happy.  Forever.
Bobby’s right. It isn’t long before Sam is there, and Dean wraps his arms around his little brother. Finally, there is peace.
They need groceries the next day, and Dean asks if Jack wants to go to Walmart with him. Jack jumps at the chance. He’s only been to Walmart once, but it was a very interesting experience, and he’s excited to repeat it.
“I thought that- since you have your own car and all- and if- when- whenever- you leave- or go for a drive or something- um, you can have music. There’s still stuff I haven’t taught you about Earth, y’know? And no one uses tapes anymore, but I do, so I made this. It’s called a mixtape, ‘cause I picked out the songs, get it?  It’s my thirteen favorite Led Zeppelin songs- see, I wrote the label. They’re my favorite band. And you should listen on tape to fully appreciate their glory.”
“Me?”  Cas looks almost shocked, and Dean suddenly wonders if Cas has ever been given a gift before. It’s not like Heaven is big on birthday bashes. “Why?”
“Cas. . .” he says, laughing, crying. When did the tears come? “This isn’t the Empty. You’re here. You’re
“I’m fine now, Dean.” Cas smiles, more with his eyes than his mouth, like always.  “Thank you for listening.”
The circumstances of his life have shaped him. Chuck created those circumstances. Chuck expects Dean’s actions to result from those circumstances.  So far, they have.
“Yeah,” says Dean, just as reverently. He gently takes it off the shelf to inspect closet. “I woulda killed for one of these things as a kid.”
He tells them of Cas’ sacrifice: the basic, non-emotional version, that is. He can’t talk about that- physically can’t without breaking down again, and he can’t do that to them. He holds it inside, like he always has, and it’s different to hold onto regret and love and sadness without any anger.
Jack is still Jack, though, so when Dean gets out his pocketknife, he has Sam carve in his name. He carves Castiel’s. He wishes he could do more. But they have no idea or power or any way to jailbreak Cas from the Empty. Only the new God would have the power to do that, and Dean finds himself hoping Cas will show up on their doorstep, maybe with a damn bow on his head, because after all that- maybe they deserved it.
“Brake?” Dean makes sure his foot’s on the correct pedal from his perch in the passenger seat. Luckily, it is.
Bobby’s yard has a plethora of cars to pick from, but Dean finds himself taking Cas to Baby anyway.  Maybe it’s just so they don’t have to go inside to pick up different keys, maybe it’s because Cas asked him for the lessons in this car, maybe it’s because Dean misses Sam and someone in the other seat of his car might make him feel better.  Maybe it just feels right.
Jack’s a smart kid- Chuck’s hubris from his self-insert stories was his downfall. And he isn’t going far- just out of sight. Dean wants to tell him how much he’s grown to mean to him, but he’s God now and he’s not sure if that’s weird. So he doesn’t say anything and watches him disappear.
They get into the car. Dean drives. Sam rides shotgun, and tells him about his life. He tells him of a little boy named Dean.
The circumstances of his life. . . they shaped him. He is who he is today because of them. The violence is because of them. The loss is because of them. The anger is because of them.
“He was mean to Claire’s dad. And he killed other angels and ate a bunch of souls because he was working with the King of Hell and he often tries to handle things on his own without telling you even when you could help and he let my father out again-“
One book leads to another, which leads to a dead end. One book leads to another, which leads to another, which leads to summoning Rowena, which leads to a library in Hell, which leads to interrogating demons, which leads to an impromptu lesson in magic- which leads to a dead end.
Dean’s never been a fan of cheesy stuff like that, but this time he knows it’s true. And it’s comforting to know that God is an old friend of yours- the son you never had, really. It’s complicated, but at least God isn’t playing them like a fiddle to act out the script for his little pay-per-view MMA smackdowns.
Dean is laughing.  “Cas, Baby is what I call my car! I was kidding!”  He laughs so hard he actually bends over a little.  Cas is still staring at him in confusion.
The other Dean appears on the front porch of Sam and Eileen’s house one day while Dean and Cas are inside. They hear the cries of joy, the hugs, the sounds of the reunion. It’s not long before Sam is dragging Dean inside to meet his uncle.
The Empty frowns. “Sadly, no.  Your pal Castiel, he woke me up oh so long ago, and it seems to have been a long-term thing.  So I was. . . releasing my frustrations.”
“You swore that you’d never leave me, baby/ whatever happened to you?/ An’ you thought it was only in movies/ as you wish all your dreams would come true, hey/ it ain’t the first time believe me, baby/ that I’ve been standing here feeling blue, blue, ha”
He thinks of being 41 and dying in a barn, taken out by a gigantic nail and a mime vampire son of a bitch.
“Okay, that was unnecessarily sappy,” says Dean, rolling his eyes. He still can’t quite keep the smile off his face. “You have to stop doing that.”
“I’m past saving,” he remembers himself saying to Cole, to the man who’s life he’d ruined and didn’t even remember doing it. “The people who love me, they pulled me back from that edge.”
“No problem, man.”  Dean leaves his arm just behind Cas, and half-smiles again.  Cas gingerly presses the gas.
Dean’s distractedness hasn’t gone unnoticed by Cas. He gently puts his hand on Dean’s arm, and when Dean looks back at him, goes to take it back, but Dean’s hand snakes out of its own accord and puts itself overtop Cas’, holding him there.
He lets them hold the moment only a moment longer before sliding over to Dean’s side and opening his door.  He can hear Cas and Dean doing the same a second later.
He’s a grown man and not a teenage girl, dammit, but he supposes finding out God wants to kill you and losing what-who- he lost, and his little
No, they’re free. They know it.  They drive off into the sunset, classic rock blaring. The ending Dean never let himself picture before midnight and a bottle of strong whiskey.
He pulls down hundreds of books in the coming weeks, each useless one feeling like a thousand.  Sam worries, he knows, as much as he helps, but he’s the only thing stopping him from doing anything reckless. He's just researching- not making deals, not committing temporary suicide. Just researching.
Dean’s prepared to say no, to laugh at him and tell him to go take a Drivers Ed class if he’s so determined, but he looks into Cas’ eager face and his words stick in his throat.
“Dude, you asked that five minutes ago.  Look out the window and be patient!” Dean never believed he’d be lecturing someone else on patience, but here he was.  Cas taps his fingers against the dashboard.
“You tell me. You came in here after your English class and just passed right back out. I didn’t wanna wake you up, man. You earned that sleep.”
They have a mission in mind, so they pass the clothes and the books on the way to groceries. Jack stops dead in his tracks at the toy aisles, though.
Mary offers to drive, and Dean cedes the keys to her without complaint. He watches Sam’s eyebrows draw in a little at this, and when he turns down shotgun to sit in the back with Cas, but he doesn’t comment. Dean hopes it’ll stay that way.
“But in the end, love isn’t really complicated. If you love someone, that’s that, and society can- what did Sam say that one time?
“I couldn’t-“ here, he stops for more air.  “I couldn’t keep being free knowing you could have been with me.”
“Doing what? Napping?” Dean shoots back, the old defiant instinct when faced with cosmic powers still alive and well inside him.
words, really, to know that they mattered to each other.  But having it confirmed is a relief.  Cas leans against him with a sigh.
They look through hundreds of books, hundreds that feel like thousands, but there’s just no instruction manual on how to revive your best friend when he gets himself swallowed by black goo for the simple crime of loving you.
He hunts with Sam. They get a dog. They cook spaghetti and  scrambled eggs and burgers, they drink beer and read books. They do normal jobs, and there’s no threat of something bigger, something world-threatening. Saving people, hunting things- the way it’s supposed to be. Dean won’t let himself forget Cas, but he moves on.
He finally understands why Sam didn’t look for him while he and Cas were in Purgatory. Without any information or power over the Empty, the only thing they can do is remember and make it count, even if it hurts like hell and makes his chest feel like an empty hole with jagged edges and brings tears to his eyes at night. He tells Sam this. Sam slams a slice of pie into his face.
Dean had almost forgotten his rash promise when Cas brought it up again.  They were outside Bobby’s house with Ellen, Jo, and Sam when Cas asked Dean “if now would be an appropriate time to learn how to drive the automobiles.”  Dean had to explain that, no, it was not, and that he should ask when they had nothing to do and not a mission to get to.  Cas agreed, then wend to sit in the backseat of Ellen and Jo’s car.
The world ending is…a lot less of a big deal, actually, than things like Cas dying, and the angels actually wanting Lucifer to rise, and the fact that
Sammy’s face will be contemplative. Gabriel and Sammy are friends now, in a strange way, like actually friends.
Cas doesn’t respond, and when Deanna looks up at her, her face is not so serene; rather it is mournful, tipped towards the heavens. “No,” she finally agrees. “I suppose it is not.”
. Deanna and Michael see Sammy and Lucifer, dragging them all the way down, and then the cage closes.
“And where will Ada be, at the end?” Gabriel asks, her voice sliding into something terrible, the kind of voice that shakes rooms. “That’s all this is. I want this to be
Sammy can’t seem to expel the demon from Bobby, and one of Deanna’s hands is pinned. She kicks up, squirming like he always tells them to do when someone’s on them.
Deanna will tell her. Deanna doesn’t really cry, but her little sisters make her want to, sometimes.
“Ah, no,” Balthazar says. “I happen to know you need me.” His eyes light on Deanna, and under his skin she can see the weapons sparking.
Deanna glances at her, but jerks her head back as the Trickster throws her head back, just laughing. “So,” Deanna says. “Who are you?”
Deanna shrugs. The day is going well, so far, and her head doesn’t hurt too much. Maybe Sammy’s psychic powers are back but Deanna is finding she doesn’t care that much. Some things seem so trivial, now. She shakes her head and tries to refocus. “Good on her.” Then, “You ok?”
Deanna almost jumps as Sammy exhales loudly, pointing to where a town has fallen into the ground. It takes a bit of looking, but Deanna realizes that the ground has split open along a fault line, and swallowed down the buildings and the foundations, the earth a hungry maw.
"It’s not all your fault,” Deanna tells her. “They’d been breaking for a while.” The way the world leaked, the colors. She’d been tuning into angel radio. That had been the singing.
“So I’ve been doing some research,” Bobby starts, “into these Alpha monsters, and all. Gimme the kid, Sam.” There’s somebody yelling, from deep inside the maze of Bobby’s house. He takes the baby, and then shoots a glance at the sisters. “Rufus is here.”
Deanna is standing in the middle of a cornfield under a sky full of stars when she gives herself over to the archangel Michael. Maybe there is an ending other than this one, but Deanna doesn’t know it. She never has. She’s locked inside her own head, forced to watch. All she can hear is noise, is screaming, but she’s forced to watch. Michael wants her to see. Her sisters – she wants to tell them, that all she’s ever done, has been for them. It stands to reason that even this would have to be too.
Ada shrugs at her. Sammy and Deanna don’t have a good answer. Their threshold for what is weird has gone significantly higher since the apocalypse began. Cas keeps glancing back at the fire. The heat of it is actually rippling away at her human form, and momentarily Deanna thinks she can see a great many wings, and eyes, and horns.
Cas watches her, gaze still unnerving even if she’s stoned out of her mind, and then puts a hand on future-Deanna’s shoulder. It wraps over the handprint-scar possessively, the same way future-Deanna, short and even more muscled than present-Deanna, snaps at the men whose eyes rest too long on Cas.
. There are two siblings, and they are brothers or sisters. There are two siblings, and one follows the father, but one does not. One rises, and one falls, and they fight, and that’s all there is, even where once there was love. You have no end other than this one.”
Cas’ll frown. She’s getting better at the whole vessel thing, except not really. She still doesn’t breathe. She misses a door and breaks her finger, and doesn’t bother to fix it until Deanna points it out. Sometimes her shoulders pop out of their sockets because she’s used to moving a back that has wings attached. She’ll stare at them, perplexed, and they just hang there until she realizes she needs to use an arm that’s gone mostly numb.
Cas looks back at her. Her eyes are hard, too, like light shining through a shattered window. She’ll laugh, high and shrill.
Castiel, terrifyingly inhuman, does not even react. There is no pain as she pulls the knife, buried up to the hilt, back out. One moment it is in, and the next it is not. She hands it back to Deanna, and Deanna has the sudden realization that this girl is not a girl but rather a thing. Then Bobby’s there, with a crowbar, and he swings it towards the girl with all the force he has. She turns, small and knobby-limbed, and puts a hand up. Yet again, there is no flinch. One moment it is moving, and the next it is not. Her fingers flash to his forehead, and then he is collapsing to the ground. Deanna makes a pained noise and rushes to him, and the girlthing steps back to let her pass.
The girl comes back down, lit by holy fire. For a moment, the world fractures a little bit around them, the warehouse cracking around her like hot glass in snow. Her eyes glow, and grace starts to run down her cheeks, rivulets of molten gold, and suddenly Deanna understands.
Deanna doesn’t know if she can forgive her. But that doesn’t mean she’s going to leave her alone. She couldn’t, even if she tried.
“For what it’s worth,” Cas says at her shoulder, so quietly it’s barely a breath. “I would do anything not to ask this of you.”
"At least Ada stands up to us,” Deanna says to Gabriel. “You ran away from Heaven, and you’re still running.”
, Deanna told him, exhilarated and nauseous all at the same time. It didn’t help that she was drunk off her ass.
For a moment, Michael too is weary of this endless fight. Memories swirl through Deanna’s – their – head, of stars collapsing and harmonious choirs, of grooming feathers made of intangible things and the once-time when laughter was joyful. Deanna cannot escape it, forced to stay at the forefront of their mind as she is, and the memories start bleeding together. They’re not so different, are they? Not after all. Not after everything.
The ceiling fan crashes to the ground and Ada gets a few shots off, and Bobby stabs himself with the demon blade. Sammy advances on Magnus, and then he’s gone, and they’re rushing Bobby to the ER.
Deanna glances back at her. The rebellious angel, sitting perched like a bird. Human bodies don’t move like that, but Cas never really seemed to care. Deanna’s so wrong she managed to fuck up an angel of God
The girlthing laughs. “Not quite, but I’ll still help you out. This is your apocalypse, yes, but I’m not sure it’d be so fun for the rest of us.”
There was always too much between them, her family. A lifetime of hardness, even after Sammy ran away to California. The kind of calluses that only pain wrought by those you loved could create.)
(Deanna hated this, hated how she couldn’t help her. She used to get like this, when she was younger. She was six feet of nerd, but there were fights after which she made herself quiet.
, but she can’t. Not when Cas looks so vulnerable. Not when she looks so horribly human and so horribly within reach.)
Deanna rubs her temples and contemplates driving them all off a cliff. “So what are you trying to say?”
“Can’t you see?” Gabriel shakes her head, and this about-face would surprise Deanna if there was any Deanna left to surprise. “I’m not on either of your sides – I’m on
.” And then she turns around and slams the bottle into whatever she can find, and the glass shards cut into her hands.
Then it’s just the three of them. Deanna yanks at her hair, trying to get her head to stop hurting. The light reflecting off Ada, the light absorbed by Sammy. She leans over, hands on her knees, and pukes. There’s blood in it, but she’s not sure that matters.
More accurately, he finds them doing research on the mother of monsters and the angelic weapons. It’s snowing, and Ada’s with them because they can borrow Missouri’s truck as long as Ada supervises and they leave Baby in Lawrence – which Deanna isn’t exactly happy about, but there’s a snow storm moving across the Midwest that ain’t stopping any time soon and has Heavenly force behind it, so she doesn’t want to mess around with that. Rufus and Victoria call them from somewhere in Michigan, and Deanna laughs over Victoria’s blunt opinions of Rufus as Ada paints Sammy’s nails and Sammy reads a book written in what might be Enochian. Ada’s a lot more invested in the angelic weapons, what with how reticent she’d been to restart hunting, and Deanna’s a little confused by that but she honestly has other things to worry about.
, Sammy said. This was before everything, wasn’t it. Eyes made of pure light, shining white out of her eye sockets. The Morningstar – that had been the thing about her fall, the thing Deanna hated. Darkness wasn’t about darkness, it was about the absence of light.
, Deanna used to say, in the same tone John said it. When she noticed why Sammy flinched, she started saying,
Sammy leans forward. She looks more animated than she has recently. Deanna got her to eat a whole sandwich earlier, too. “So before we broke the last seal – ”
For a second, Ada’s eyes glow in the darkness. They’re gold. They are the downfall of empires. Deanna blinks hard, and realizes it’s just a car passing by, casting light through the window.
-showing-her-emotions-behind-her-eyes thing. Or maybe Deanna just doesn’t know her well enough, yet. Christ, that’s scary, the knowing and the not-knowing.
they thunder. One of their legs is snapped, but they stand like it does not matter because it doesn’t, wielding a sword that drips with holy oil and fire, shoving themself in front of Deanna.
feel strained. Sammy disappears and Deanna knows she’s with Ruby, but every time she asks they just end up yelling at each other; the knowledge that they’re so outnumbered, with this apocalypse, with Sammy’s jewel-bright eyes and how Deanna doesn’t know how to help her. And now there’s this – thing, between them. Anna’s words pick at them both, and Alistair’s too, and Sammy keeps looking at Deanna like…like she’s ashamed. There’s so much between them, and maybe were they younger they’d be punching it out but instead it’s just sharp words and angry silences.
