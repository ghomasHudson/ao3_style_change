He picked up Steve’s hand and squeezed it tightly; if he hadn’t had the serum, Steve probably wouldn’t have noticed that Tony was starting to shake.
“You don’t have to believe me,” Steve barreled on, a knowing look on his face, “But I just see a brilliant, young science whiz who managed to build himself the most
He set the box down on the ground and opened up to the first page, only to slam the book closed. His cheeks felt hot and he knew that if he looked in the mirror his face would be flushed a beet red. Sure, Tony was, in general, quite sexual, but he’d been only seventeen. Never in his life would Steve have expected a giant diagram of a penis on the first page, with anatomical detail that made him swallow nervously.
Tony scowled and shifted himself down on the bed, readjusting himself and Peter and forcing Bruce to stand up. He put Peter in the middle of his chest to best support the babe, wincing slightly when his small hands clutched at his chest hair.
“I cannot believe you pulled that stunt,” Steve was grousing again, his arms folded over his chest as he watched PJ to make sure the child didn’t try to open the doors, “You could have gotten us killed.”
The pull to join the baby in sleep became unbearable. He shifted the furs around so he was covered up to the neck and closed his eyes, breathing in the mixed scent of both Peter and Steve to calm his thoughts. Exhaustion from the hectic morning settled in his bones and he was dead to the world. He slept dreamlessly until commotion outside of the room triggered something in his brain and his eyes snapped open. His poor heart pounded as he sluggishly grappled with trying to figure out what woke him up.
Being careful since PJ was still asleep between them, Tony leaned over to pull Steve into an awkward hug. He let his eyes close for a second, feeling the other tuck his head into his neck, staccato breaths warm on his collarbones. They stayed like that for a moment, with Steve clutching at his back, somehow small despite his physical size. Tony waited for the Captain to pull away first, giving him a fond smile as he reached up to brush away the stray tears on Steve’s cheeks.
“You scared me,” he grumbled in a low voice, sitting up and rubbing his eyes, “The day has not even begun—what is the matter?”
“Such a good boy, doing so well eating,” he praised, tugging his clothing back into place between pats, “Your mama would be so proud of you, darling--”
Knowing that an argument was pointless—and that Steve was listening—Tony trudged up into the Avengejet, smiling at a slightly bedraggled Bruce already buckled in for the flight.
. You’re almost done,” he murmured, quickly scrubbing PJ down with a scrap of washcloth, “Then we’ll get you all wrapped up in a towel and
“Oh my god,” Steve mumbled, covering up his face with his free hand in embarrassment, “Of course he’s known, he’s Tony, he’s so smart and perceptive about
“I’m not going to take it from you, jeez,” he snorted, putting up his hands defensively, “I’m going to clean up this stuff.”
Peter did not answer, but the baby seemed to understand and settled down, allowing Tony to don his knapsack and wineskin as he ducked out of their hiding spot. He wrapped his arms around the baby and started into the rain, walking for another few hours before a small sound drew his attention. He continued to move, but he changed directions every few minutes, listening for the sound again. An hour passed without incident, so he let himself relax, smiling as he finally exited the other side of the forest. The clearing was not large, and the sun felt good on his face, so Tony paused, looking up into the sky. He let out a deep sigh of relief, closing his eyes and letting the warm rays melt over his skin. However, once he began to move again, a cold, sharp object was pressed into the back of his neck. A chill swept through his body and his Omega nature took over; he pivoted on his heel, crouching over slightly as he faced the person behind him. It was a woman, a little taller than himself, holding an elongated spear out so its tip was pointed at his throat. His senses started going haywire and he pivoted again, finding himself completely surrounded by similarly-dressed men and women, all holding spears to his neck.
“HYDRA doesn’t set booby traps. They set death traps,” Steve replied seriously, lifting his shield a little higher, “Alright, team, into the complex.”
After a minute or two of painfully watching the boy cry quietly, PJ eventually settled into sniffles again, rubbing his red eyes with his tiny fists. He gulped down air before scooting a little closer to Tony to settle his tiny palm against Tony’s once more.
Tony woke under the first rays of morning light, groaning softly as he pulled and stretched his arms. He smacked his lips and fluttered his eyes open, enjoying the slight warm buzz of waking up in a warm bed. Content, he rolled over onto his side to go back to sleep, only to pause once he saw Steve sleeping next to him. The Warlord was snoring softly, twitching in his sleep as if he was deep in a dream. The movement dragged Tony’s eyes downward over Steve’s bare back and hips, coming to rest on the swell of his ass. It took a moment for his brain to catch up with him, and once he realized that he, too, was naked, drew in a sharp breath.
The very last picture was taken at the end of the summer before Sophomore year. Tony was looking up into the camera he was holding with a big grin, arm wrapped around Steve’s waist. Steve’s hand was on his chest and he was looking up at him, and even with just a photograph could he see the devotion pouring out of Steve’s eyes. He’d taken that picture the day before Peggy waltzed into their classroom.
It was hard to talk while moving with such a ferocious ache between his legs, but he managed, even if it stole every ounce of energy from his body. By the time he reached the dining hall and had settled in his chair, he was exhausted and in more pain than he cared to admit. With a grunt, Tony shoved down the feeling and lowered Peter into his arms, tucking him up under his shirt to position him for breakfast.
Having been fairly mute for the whole ordeal, Steve made a gruff noise and let go of Tony’s arms, watching as the engineer crept to the edge of the bed. He picked up the elephant, shushing the child as he slowly offered the toy as a sign of peace. Despite the boy’s continued wails, he seemed to allow Tony to pick him up, elephant and all, holding him close to his chest.
“Don’t make me knock you and the kid out. We only need you alive, not in one piece,” the second guard growled, eyeing Tony, “Sit down and shut up.”
“Talking to Steve in the morning would be good,” she said, “You guys need a bit to think before you hash out whatever relationship you guys want to have. And you’ll need to do it without the kid. I’ll take him for the shift after breakfast.”
The sound of someone clearing their throat startled him, causing Tony to whirl around. Steve was leaning against the doorway and watching them, a fond and concerned smile on his face. He stepped toward them and offered a hand, only coming closer when Tony nodded his permission. Slowly, Steve approached Peter, sidling up behind Tony so he could peer at the infant. Careful to not make any sudden movements, Steve gently laid a hand on Peter’s back, nearly covering the baby due to the size of his hand. A few beats passed and Peter began to quiet, wails turning into quiet sniffles as he ducked his head into Tony’s neck. Shocked, Tony looked up to Steve, who only smiled and winked back at him.
Steve bit his lip and nodded, running a hand through Tony’s hair to scrape his nails over his scalp. He grinned when Tony visibly loosened, only to have him sit up straight and glare.
“Nat, when’s Fury’s ETA?” Tony asked, retracting a gauntlet to carefully place the pads of his bare fingers on the child’s forehead, “This kid needs medical attention
Tony tensed under Steve’s hand, still unsure of the Captain’s intentions. He shrugged it off as he stood, attempting to play it off coolly.
“Let us take a walk first, while the day is new,” Steve suggested, “I want to show you the gardens before the townsfolk are up and about, yeah? Then we can take our time.”
Steve nodded and followed the team of doctors down into the hospital, sucking in a breath when they walked into Tony’s private room. He immediately went over to sit in a chair next to Tony’s bedside, scooping up his right hand to hold carefully between his own.
“You are not going to hurt him. If he wants me, he will let us know. Am I going to have to force you to hold him?”
Counting the seconds, Tony tried to ignore the pounding in his head as he regulated his breathing, all too aware of how close he was to hyperventilating. The anxiety from the past twenty-four hours was starting to catch up to him, tightening his heart and shortening his already quick breaths. He sunk his hands into his own hair, scraping blunt nails against his scalp as he fisted his hair in both hands, distantly aware that he was starting to rock back and forth.
Steve nodded, staring blankly back at Bucky’s concerned look. After a second, Bucky sighed and nodded, moving and sitting down. The three men sat together in the silent room, each in their own state of misery as the minutes ticked by in agony. Now, he wasn’t as religious as he once was, but as the waiting period hit the five-hour mark, Steve was starting to consider praying when the back doors flew open and various doctors streamed out, causing all three of them to fly up out of their seats.
Now it was his turn to blush. Peter paid no mind to the conversation happening and tucked his face into Tony’s neck, easily falling asleep in his daddy’s warm arms. Tony was glad for it; a sleeping baby was much easier to deal with than an awake baby, and he was going to need his concentration for the day’s lesson.
“Have you talked to Sam about it?” Rhodey asked, “He might just not realize that you want to be wined and dined. There’s no shame in that, y’know. We also deserve to be treated like royalty. Not just Tony.”
“I…am not shacking up with Steve,” Tony said slowly, peeking out around Steve’s oddly still body, “Why do you think I’m shacking up with Steve?”
“So. After that, we talked about it, and we thought we wanted kids,” Tony continued, gauging Steve’s reaction, “Y’know, she’d be the hardworking mom, I’d step down and just do R&D and by then I was
“We have him now. We’re not preventers, we’re Avengers. And I’m going to make sure Zola personally pays for everything he’s done to my son—
“I really need to start doing words with you so you can talk more and tell me what you want,” He murmured, “Alright, up we go.”
“Bad news is that the documentation is over eight thousand pages long,” Clint said, his hands clenching, “Some of the subjects only take up half of a page.”
! Which, Tony didn’t really blame them: if he was dating Clint, he wouldn’t want anyone else to know, either.
“Bye-bye?” PJ asked, settling his head against Tony’s chest as the group made their way to the elevator.
“Okay, okay, shhh, honey, don’t you start a panic, you don’t have your medication with you,” Tony shushed hurriedly, hearing Steve’s voice start to strain, “I’m right here, nice and alive, yeah? C’mon.”
“No,” Rhodey and Tony said simultaneously, to which the former stared more at the latter, his quirked eyebrow the only indication that he planned on bringing this conversation back up later.
Pepper watched as Tony read the book to PJ, having him repeat the names of the colors and point out other things in the room that were the same color. Watching them interact made her choke up a little; she’d dreamed of kids herself, and at one point, with Tony. Yet, watching him dote on and coo over a boy that had his hair and Steve’s sharp nose made her realize that perhaps it had been the right decision to let that go.
“Tony’s not trying to woo me,” He said to the ceiling, sounding pitiful, “He’s just being nice and helpful because you’re the team leader. That’s all.”
Discussing defensive strategies flowed like his blood, giving him more confidence as he went on. He pointed out the flaws as he had with Steve the previous night, but before he could finish, Barnes interrupted him.
Standing up from the bed with a renewed sense of self, Tony grabbed up the bedding and, with PJ’s clumsy help, started to put the sheets on the bed. Though it took a few attempts at making it—mostly due to PJ climbing up when it wasn’t finished and creasing the sheets—they finally got the bed pieced together, finishing it by tossing various plush toys up onto the bed.
“Breathe, darling. I have you,” he whispered into Tony’s skin, “You feel so good, sweetheart, we can stop here--”
“Okay,” Tony whispered softly, forcing himself to pull away so he could get another look at the radiant smile on Steve’s face, “Gonna miss you too, Steeb.”
A large siren blared, causing Tony to scream from being startled. He immediately glared at Natasha who shrugged, watching the liquid in the tube recede into the floor and the boy be lowered. As soon as the liquid disappeared completely, the top of the tube slid down, leaving the boy motionless with an oxygen mask over his small nose and mouth.
He looked up at Steve, relieved to see that the man had finally started to come back, his eyes focused and present. Steve offered a small smile to Tony, gently moving PJ so he could press his lips against Tony’s with a relieved sigh. Once again upset at being left out, PJ pressed his face up against Steve and Tony’s, making the adults laugh and pull apart.
Looking back down at PJ, Tony gently brushed a few of the boy’s flyaway hairs out of his face, then covered him back up with some of the extra blanket. He sighed softly, pressing a few fingers to the boy’s chest to feel his faint, steady heartbeat.
“Yeah, and under threat of permanent detainment in the government’s strongest prison in the middle of the ocean if we tell anyone,” Steve said, “But they can fuck off. Tony deserves to know, he
matter, at least, in terms of needing it to live. I, ah, I just notice the others, that is all. And the way they look at you. I know they would never touch you, but the hunger in their eyes can be… concerning.”
She looked at the three men before sighing and shifting her own cards, pulling out the next question.
“When we made up his bed. He just said it when I was sort of moping after Steve started being Steve while we were talking and saying cryptic shit and then the kid panicked and so to escape Steve talking I took PJ to his bedroom,” Tony babbled, sitting up and picking at the skin around his nails, “That was right before he started to jump and passed out. So. Fairly new development.”
“Hey! Hey now, shh,” Tony tried to soothe, gently deflecting the little hands, “It is all done, no more bath. I promise. We are getting dry now, okay? Then we will put you in some nice new clothes and I will let you wake Papa up.”
Blinking sad brown and blue up at Tony, PJ nodded, shifted himself around until he was comfortable, his eyes drifting shut. Once his small snoring started up, Tony glanced down, feeling his heart break at the pure exhaustion written into the child’s features. Of course, the familiarity of the look stung, but he couldn’t help but stare at how intertwined his and Steve’s mechanisms were already showing through PJ: a little crease between his eyebrows as he slept had always been Rogers’ MO, his nose crinkling as he dreamt had always been a feature that Pepper had said Tony had as he slept. Even if he hadn’t known PJ was his own, he would have been able to tell just by watching the kid. And that scared the hell out of him.
“It’s okay, honey. If you want to cry, that’s okay,” He said gently, attempting to soothe the child despite being unable to get close to him, “I’m going to be right here, sweetheart. I’m sorry, pumpkin. I didn’t mean to startle you.”
“She’s the smallest,” Bruce snorted, setting the phlebotomy equipment to the side, “Okay. First, we’ll do basic measurements, give him somewhat of a physical. Then, after we do the draw, I want to put in a request for a CAT scan.”
, but after one too many knowing looks from his teammates, Steve found himself pacing in his bedroom, strategically going through his previous discussions with Tony to try and look for any underlying motive: the shower, the ice cream, the technological advice—no matter how unnecessary, Tony was still very patient when Steve actually did need help—even the gifts of varying art supplies that would randomly show up on his doorstep seemed to point toward an ulterior motive.
“Steve, you’re shaking. C’mon, bud,” Bucky’s voice brought him out of his head, “That’s it. What’s going on up there?”
Tony had just stuck his tongue out at him, only to shriek when Steve tried to give him a sloppy kiss. They’d laughed and rolled off of the couch in a tangle of limbs, giggling to each other as they settled into their new position. That was six months ago, the night after they’d officially moved in together for the last few months of high school before he headed off to MIT and Steve returned to training. Steve kept him on top of his new anxiety medication, he nagged Steve into doing his daily journaling, and they were content being together.
He offered a hand to Steve to help him up off the floor, stepping into his space to hug him with one arm. Steve’s arms came up and wrapped around them both, warm and comforting as they chased away the lingering feelings of fear.
“Thank you,” Tony murmured, wrapping an arm around her back as he rested his head on top of her own, “I considered asking Sam, but I don’t want the kid coming back asking to fly every ten seconds. I’d rather he know how to kill a man with his thumbnail.”
Steve accepted the knife and moved back into the shower area, closing the curtain before stripping off his nearly ruined suit and tossing it over top of the bar. He heard Sam grunt and swear, making him laugh as he turned the shower on.
Steve nodded, turning his head to nose at Tony’s palm. He reached up to grab the hand and brought it to his lips to kiss Tony’s knuckles.
He shook his head and took a swig, then handed it back. Suddenly, he felt more tired than he had been before. Sleep called to him, but Peter’s whining was much louder and demanded his attention. The poor thing had to be hungry and scared, and he had no real way to explain to the tot what was happening.
“Friend Stark, where will we put the boy? The Tower is not accommodated for a child,” Thor asked, absentmindedly twirling his hammer in one hand, “Will Miss Potts be taking care of him?”
“I think I just died,” Steve answered, grinning at Tony’s laugh as the other clambered off of him, “I’m pretty sure I died. I just died and went to heaven and met the most beautiful angel—”
With some finagling, he pulled Steve back against his chest, ducking under his arm so Steve’s pecs were right by his face. He kissed the swollen muscle before motioning for the thermos, unscrewing it and setting the cap aside.
“What? I can—I can do this parenting thing,” He protested, keeping one arm curled around PJ so the boy wouldn’t fall, “Besides, you’re hurt—”
“Aww, baby, and here I thought it wasn’t that good,” Tony teased, grinning when Steve tugged the blanket up to try and cover his cheeks.
He pushed hard on the wall, grinning behind the mask as a false door sunk into the wall and moved to the side, revealing a staircase lit with emergency lights. As he stepped back, Natasha and Clint quickly took up their positions in the front, silently descending the staircase. At the bottom, they regrouped, watching Natasha as she surveyed their surroundings. Once she began to move, the others followed, careful to check behind themselves often.
In the silence, the doctor carefully slipped the needle into PJ’s arm, only keeping it there as long as absolutely necessary. Once enough blood had been drawn, he removed the needle, having Tony hold a strip of gauze on the mark until he could put an Iron Man band-aid on it.
It was quiet again, so Tony stood from his chair, slowly moving over to kneel in front of Steve. He took his hand in both of his own, looking up to search his eyes.
Quickly, he squashed the thought, setting to memorizing the child’s face. His features seemed so small and dainty, like porcelain that would break at the slightest touch. Drifting back to Steve for a moment, Tony smiled at the boy’s eyelashes, noting how much they looked like Steve’s: almost feminine, as they were long and thick.
As he hugged the boy tight, Tony watched as SHIELD personnel filed into the room, bringing a tray of equipment with them. One of them started to talk about the drainage process, but Tony waved them quiet and carefully rolled onto his right side, giving PJ a small smile as the medical team started to work.
Tony could only nod, as he was afraid to speak or he might burst into tears. Instead, he turned to kiss at Peter’s cheeks and rock the baby back and forth, holding him as tight as he could.
He tucked Peter up under his shirt and against his chest, creating a warm cocoon for him to hopefully feel safe in. The whining did reduce to whimpers, and with a few practiced shifts, the allure of a meal finally got him quiet. All four men let out a sigh of relief at the welcome silence.
Needless to say, once PJ calmed down, there was a sudden awkwardness in the room that not even Tony, the master of escaping awkward situations, could escape. Steve’s arms were wrapped too tightly around him and it’s not like he was about to leave the warmth of his own volition, either. Sure, he was being a little greedy—it wasn’t often the soldier allowed this type of touch, let alone offer it first to others. Realizing that Steve was starting to pull back, Tony took a quick breath, focusing himself on the armful of upset child in his possession.
“I don’t know, Barton, I thought the red squid skull on their suits was a dead giveaway,” he drawled sarcastically, blasting off to head forward into the midst of the fight.
“Oh, no. Same. Me too. Dudes, I mean. Yes. Absolute yes,” Tony said quickly, stumbling over his words, “I just—with Howard and all. J knows. Mom probably does. But yes. Dudes are a yes.”
“Mmm, you love my sweat, don’t lie to me,” Tony laughed, grinning at Steve’s grumble of annoyance, “Fine. I’ll get up, go kick the ball a bit, and then we can hang out until the game.”
Tony wanted to escalate the argument, but a soft whimper kept his response limited to what he hoped was a threatening glare. He slid off the bed and padded over to Pete’s crib, relaxing his face as he looked down at the baby.
Natasha nodded and strode over, plucking the bag off the man’s head. Immediately, Tony shrieked in delight and ran over, plopping himself side-saddle into the man’s lap and hugging him close one-armed.
“Don’t listen to him, you just blink at him and he’ll fall over for you,” Tony said, scooping PJ up off the counter and settling him on his hip, “Why don’t we go say bye-bye to your Papa and aunts and uncles? Then we can go play for a while before lunch.”
Bruce sighed, waving the light over the eye to check dilation before letting the eyelids close. He turned to Tony, watching the brunet pace around the room.
He stared at the Prime, watching him pick at the fraying hem of his shirt as they walked. They were in a silent deadlock until Steve sighed and dropped his hand from his shirt.
Deciding that for once in his life he could swallow his pride better than his pain, Tony swung himself out of bed, wrapping the comfortable blanket around his shoulders before padding out of the room. He followed the sounds of Steve’s gentle baritone, eventually finding himself in the kitchen, where the blond was attempting to feed PJ bits of what looked like a peanut butter and jelly sandwich.
“I’ll be back,” He heard Steve say, “Do you want the whole coffee pot or just a cu—you know, I don’t know why I’m asking. I’m bringing you the whole pot.”
above average,” Bruce continued, leaning back from the microscope to scrub his eyes, “But also, we don’t know how the serum will continue to react. For all we know, as he gets older, the serum could naturally divide more than the regular white blood cells and he could develop full super-serum abilities. I don’t really know—it’s just a guess.”
Slowly, the heat that scorched his insides receded, cooling down enough to reveal the thick exhaustion and guilt that resided underneath. If he was honest with himself, Tony felt bad for Steve. He understood that the Prime had little physical control over his body and any mental faculties he had were shut down to make way for the biological response. Tony knew a thing or two about biology royally fucking him over, so he reached through what still burned to soothe Steve’s guilt.
He kissed the babe’s cheeks until Peter began to squirm and giggle, grabbing at his father’s face to tug on his beard. Wincing, Tony gently pulled his fingers away and kissed them, unable to feel upset when hearing his baby’s joyful noises. Pete squealed and kicked his legs, making Tony laugh.
Moving to the closet, Tony quickly set to grabbing a few blankets, laying them out on the bed for extra warmth. He set the box of tissues on his nightstand, and before he could talk himself out of it, slid into the bed to let PJ curl up to him.
Steve snarled and tried to lurch at Tony, but the shackles held tight and kept him from doing anything more than leaning forward. It was terrifying, to say the least; he had never seen a feral Alpha, let alone a
amount of food. Perhaps calling it a plate was not descriptive enough: “platter” might convey a better sense of the size, or even “trough.” Either way, Tony had to forcibly keep his mouth closed to keep from drooling onto himself. He went first for the section of fruit, picking up various cuts of melon and berries to eat. Moving clockwise, he easily polished off each section until he ended up at the meat.
wonderful. To me, to him…to the team. The world, even. I know—I know its difficult in terms of believing me when I say that, but you really are, Tony. You’re absolutely wonderful, caring, kind…in your own way, of course, but nevertheless, you are.”
He stood up and pulled Tony with him, sharing messy, sloppy kisses as they nearly ran the four blocks down to city hall. They were catcalled and whistled at a few times, but Tony didn’t care, he was going to be
“Sir has prevented all access to the shop,” JARVIS’ voice said over the intercom when Steve jiggled the handle.
“It’s no excuse. I fucked up, I hurt you, and then you got even more hurt because I did what I thought was right for both of us without ever asking you. And I’m way past looking for forgiveness, mostly because I know I don’t deserve it. I just—I don’t want you to hurt like this, Tony. Ma’s working with the authorities, and she thinks she’s got a really good case, even if Howard brings out his best lawyers. We’ve all volunteered to testify, too. Plus, she thinks she can get Maria to help. Even—even if you don’t want me around anymore, I wanted to do
“Fine. I’ll make sure to pass it on to Bruce as well. He may want to look into the strength of the serum itself within PJ and possibly want to monitor it,” Bucky sighed, standing up from the rocking chair, “I’ll leave you two lovebirds alone, then.”
what the Alpha was attempting to do. He tried to complain, but a sharp pain on his left nipple snapped him out of it and caused him to yelp, then sigh as his aching chest began to lessen in pain. Steve’s innocent smile melted into a knowing look, which Tony was
He sighed when Steve patted his back, peeking open an eye to look over at the Alpha. A concerned face looked back at him, but Tony quelled it with a small smile, letting his feet carry him wherever Steve guided him. Occasionally, the people around them would stop, stare, and whisper, but they mostly streamed by, not caring that a total stranger, an unclaimed Omega, was walking amongst them flanked by their leader. It was a surreal experience, especially for a former prince. He was used to ogling, not being
Steve sighed and fell back onto the bed, forcing Tony to steady himself with his hands on Steve’s abdomen.
“You are thinking too hard, little rabbit,” Steve said, pulling Tony out of his thoughts by smoothing a thumb over the wrinkle between his brows, “You will cramp up your face if you keep that expression for much longer.”
He finally edged close enough to the kid to carefully reach out and place a tentative finger on his knee, not moving when PJ looked up, completely startled. He scrambled back an inch or two, chest heaving as he frantically looked around, only to have his gaze settle back on Tony.
Together, they squished onto the couch, ending up with Tony on Steve’s lap, his back pressed up against Thor’s arm. It felt warm, comforting,
He grunted as PJ threw himself back into Tony’s hold, but he quickly got his arms around the boy, picking him up off the floor so his bare feet wouldn’t touch the concrete. With some maneuvering—and a hell of a lot of internalized screaming from the pain—he managed to get them both onto the one bed, his arms still tight around PJ.
As he ticked down the measurements, he kept PJ’s hand held in his own, idly rubbing his thumb over the child’s tiny knuckles. Once he got to the bottom, he looked over at the boy, a tiny frown on his face.
“Talk to Sam,” Rhodey said gently, reaching over to squeeze Bucky’s shoulder, “Thankfully, he can’t read minds, but that does mean that if you want something you have to ask for it.”
“Once again, not surprised that you’re the favorite,” Tony snorted, leading the three to the powder room just down the hall, “Okay, kiddo. Here’s the bathroom.”
“I would like to breathe sooner rather than later,” Tony offered up, shivering when Steve nibbled on the mark.
“Oh, gods, they were that scared? Psh, then they have no business being at a brothel,” Tony said dismissively, “If it had been me, I would have happily been ripped in two by your delicious cock.”
Tony considered getting up to check outside the door, but a crash and a yelp quickly stifled that thought and he shut his eyes tight, laying perfectly still as it would make him disappear. A quiet whimper had him peek open an eye and he smiled, seeing that the baby had finally decided to join the fun.
“Stand down, soldier. He’s trying to help Tony, not offend your marriage,” Rhodey said, putting a hand on Steve’s chest to push him toward the seats, “We need to get strapped in and then we’ll get him somewhere safe, okay?”
booth, it took all of his willpower to make it home before breaking down into tears. Steve never seemed to notice—or care—that Tony didn’t return his texts or requests for homework help, sit with him at lunch, or even pick the seat next to him in their classes. When he’d finally worked up the balls to tell Steve he’d quit soccer because he couldn’t move as well anymore with the escalation of Howard’s beatings, Steve had said, “Oh, that’s nice, Tony.”
Steve was quiet as the others chattered, finding Tony’s hand again. On that occasion, he had been the one who stayed up the latest, making sure Thor, Bucky, and Bruce were asleep before waiting for Tony to come back after Mr. Stark had called him in to talk. Of course, he was ever curious and stood outside Mr. Stark’s study to peek in on Tony.
A chorus of ‘yes, mom’ rang out in the room; satisfied, Tony nodded, turning to Steve with a half-smile.
“Agreed,” Steve chimed in, sighing at Tony’s annoyed stare, “Tony, you have broken ribs, and we’re still making sure you don’t get an abscess at your drainage point. You don’t exactly have super healing, so you do need to take it easy. Even if it’s for a day.”
Tony only laughed as he and Natasha ducked back out of the room, following the right-hand wall deeper into the maze of the HYDRA complex. Together, they crept as silently as they could with Tony leading, repulsors lighting their way.
“Shut up,” he snarled, “Who told you that you could bring these pests into the house again? Didn’t you learn your fucking lesson the first time?”
Steve interrupted him by laughing, leaning to knock his head down against Tony’s. He turned to smile at him, reaching up to cup his cheek before pecking him gently on the lips.
“Considering you’re the one who writes up the reports? A little,” Rhodey had joked, shouldering Tony, “But for real man, I miss you. Text me when we can hang out and I’ll come over.”
With a grunt, Tony turned PJ around, setting him on his other knee so he was facing Pepper. She cooed softly, reaching to gently pick up one of his tiny hands.
“The betting pool on you two. Did they not tell you? We have a huge group bet as to when you two would get together,” Rhodey said slowly, looking at the two men, “…No? Okay. Well, you didn’t hear it from me, but I’m about a week out if you guys want to hold off that long.”
Steve blinked slowly, flicking his gaze back and forth as though he could not decide which of Tony’s eyes he wanted to look at.
“Hey there, big guy. I helped you and your dad back in the awful place, remember?” Rhodey said gently, sitting down on Tony’s bed, “I’ve heard so much about you. You like Captain America, huh?”
“Shh, darling, my love, everything is alright,” he soothed, lifting up the baby’s dress to check his undergarment, “You are clean, you have been fed—is it just attention you need, little one? Have I not given you enough? Tsk, how awful of me, hm?”
Tony looked at the two settled pairs and slowly turned, making eye contact with Steve. They moved to their own pair of chairs, settling a little uncomfortably.
“What—what is that?” Tony asked, seeing Steve stumble up to his locker and shoulder off his backpack, “Steve, what did you do.”
“Shh, my darling, I know, this morning was supposed to be about you and me, huh?” He whispered in the Southern dialect, gently rocking them back and forth while he pressed kisses to the baby’s cheeks, “You are alright, little one. Daddy’s here, I have you, no need to cry.”
There was a long stretch of silence before Tony nodded, unable to look up from the bed. He stared at the ugly pattern on the sheets as he heard the door open and Jarvis’ familiar footfalls approach, stopping when he sat in Rhodey’s now unoccupied seat.
He looked up at Steve for reassurance, smiling softly at the devotion in his eyes. He leaned up for a kiss and then settled down into the warm bed, quickly succumbing to sleep for the second time that night.
A soft giggle from down the hallway pulled Tony out of his depressing thoughts. He smiled to himself and pretended to not hear it as he cooled the flattened steel and his tools in preparation for the attack. No sooner had he stripped off his gloves did a small body attempt to crawl into the forge room to get to him. Tony quickly turned and nabbed the toddler, grinning at Peter’s squeals of delight as he was lifted and placed on Tony’s hip.
, but now that he was questioning if Steve actually returned his feelings, he needed a little space to try and force his brain to slow down and attempt to organize past interactions to look for signs that he missed.
“Bruce needs to stay here. The Hulk is the best defense for the kid—no offense,” Clint said, twirling an arrow between his fingers, “We could try aerial, but its pretty much all underground, with nothing around for miles. It's just a covered hatch in the middle of bumfuck, nowhere.”
, Tones. And every—every goddamn time this happens all I can think of is—is how much I love you, and how I don’t know how I’m going to live without you,” he sobbed, breath hitching throughout his admission, “I
on the hard stone. The candlelight reflected off of the tear tracks on his cheeks and instinctively Tony reached out to wipe them off. He let his hand rest on Steve’s face, pretending that he did not see the oddly determined look in his eyes.
“No, no. It happened too fast for you to have said anything. I do not blame you at all, Thor. You have been so good to me these last few days, I am not sure I even
The room went silent. Tony flushed and looked at the floor, unsure if it was humiliation or embarrassment that flooded his cheeks. Rhodey took the opportunity to drape his arm around him again and pulled him in close, squeezing his bicep as comfort.
Coulson rolled his eyes up to the ceiling and said, “Yes, James. Hair growth, enlargement of genitalia, bone expansion and solidification, and various and sundry other intricacies.”
“He and you will be good for PJ,” she said quietly, cupping Tony’s cheek, “You can do this, Tony. I know you can. And…I’m happy for you. With him. You’re good together.”
“Of course, but let me talk with Natasha first. She may have recovered files about what happened to him specifically. I’m sure they kept extensive records of the testing they did on him, she just has to find it. I’ll ask around, see what the best foot forward is. Until then, you both need to rest.”
Tony rifled around until he found a suitable pot and set it on the stovetop, humming to himself as he poured a generous amount of milk into it and turned the heating element on. PJ watched carefully, thumb stuck in his mouth as he eyed Tony warily.
Tony tried to go for a comforting smile, but PJ merely sniffled, reaching up to rub at his eyes. Before he could react, Steve had already squatted down in front of the boy, reaching up slowly to put a hand on his knee.
“I thought I was going to lose you,” he whispered, “I thought I was going to watch you die—this is the
Tony blushed and hid his face back in Steve’s neck, only pulling away when he was set down in a chair. He whined, leaning up for a kiss before Steve scurried off to the kitchen to get their supper. He kept his eyes glued to Steve’s ass, only to yelp when he was startled by someone sitting down heavily on his right.
PJ looked at each of the men as Tony pointed them out, immediately glaring at Bucky once he recognized the connection. Slowly, he moved over to Natasha, holding onto her leg instead once Bucky tried to approach. Realizing what the kid was doing, Tony laughed, putting a hand over his reactor.
Thankfully, he did think to repack the jet’s emergency kit, which meant they had tents, a flint and steel, and some water tablets, but beyond that, they were screwed. Plus, since Thor no longer had his hammer, even Heimdall was unreachable.
“It really is a sight to see how connected you two are,” Bruce said, awkwardly changing the subject, “I knew that parent-child bonds were strong, but I have never seen anything like this.”
“You went and bonded with your enemy’s son. I think you are beyond not doing certain things,” Natasha said calmly.
“Oh, I’m plenty angry. At Howard, at the world, at how fucked your childhood was—but not at you. Not over something like this,” Steve said carefully, turning Tony in his chair to face him, “Love, we all cope differently. And if yours was getting lost in a world where you felt like you mattered and were loved, then so be it. I’m glad—Even though I was asleep then, I’m glad that I could at least be there for you. Like that.”
“Okay, how about we fix your hair and clean the slice on your head?” He tried, “Then you can have a quick sponge bath before we go see Bruce.”
Tony sniffled and looked up, blinking at Clint standing behind Steve. The archer raised an eyebrow and offered a hand, which Tony took to lever himself up with. Steve immediately stood up with him and kept his hands on Tony’s hips, as if to help keep him steady.
Tony gestured with the ladle before filling the thermos up and capping it, passing it to Steve with a knowing smile. Then, he filled his own mug, blowing on the top of it to try and cool it down.
Finding the positioning a bit more comfortable, Tony nodded, following Natasha out of the tube room and back to the morgue. Once the realization hit him of what the morgue had been used for, he suddenly wished he had a protocol for throwing up in the suit.
“Sorry, buddy. I keep scaring him away from you, huh? I don’t mean to,” he apologized softly, attempting to keep PJ calm by rubbing circles on his back, “He’ll be back later. I think. I can have J ask him to come get you, okay? Do you wanna stay with Papa for a bit?”
“I trust you to let me back off if I want to. Now, let us go eat, okay?” Tony laughed, “No more talk of this. Our little secret until the morning. Promise?”
There was an awkward second before they all made the promise, still locked in the group hug. The feeling of safety no longer lingered, so Tony pulled away from Steve, sniffling and wiping away the few tears that had fallen.
Tony took a breath, looking around at the Avengers and SHIELD personnel waiting for his explanation.
“I think he already knows. I went up to change and he was in PJ’s room singing to him,” Tony muttered, leaning into her touch for once, “I used my emergency elevator so I wouldn’t have to talk to him.”
“Yes, he did, but I was expecting it,” He answered carefully, “He’s a kid who’s been through rough shit. Of
“Yeah. You gotta tell me your name, though, so I can put it on here,” he said, jabbing at the paper.
“Astute observation, Thor,” he said, his voice removed of any of the Northern accent, “I am Doctor Banner, Tony. You can call me Bruce, if you would like. I am the resident physician—the Prime informed us that you fell out of bed and are having trouble speaking?”
Tony froze. Had Howard sent men to find him? Had he miscalculated his father’s negligence toward him? The thought of having to return home and face his father with Peter nauseated him to the point that he shuddered and hunched over, expecting himself to vomit out of fear.
“Okay, so the first step to making hot cocoa is to check and make sure you have milk. Some people make it with water, but then its hot
Tony reached up to put both of his hands on the back of his neck, simulating rocking back-and-forth as he secretly brushed along his skin. Feeling that the faintly raised scar hadn’t been disturbed, a small sense of peace overcame him, but he kept up the attack symptoms, working through the plan in his head.
“I know, right? The one time I couldn’t use protection,” Tony blurted, trying to fill the awkwardness that had descended in the room.
“Yes, Tony. You will. Isn’t that what you wanted Pepper to do?” Bruce answered calmly, narrowing his eyes a bit, “You’ll be okay, Tony. You always figure these things out. Now. I just got PJ’s slides, so I’m going to go look at that. Go talk to Steve.”
“No more leaving your ass and prick out on display. Put on something that covers you, or I will gouge out the eyes of anyone who looks at you,” Tony said firmly.
The helicopter couldn’t get there fast enough. It was all Steve could do to not throw up everywhere as he carefully peeled his husband out of the smoldering wreckage, careful of the machinery lodged in his chest. He had to call Bucky over to have him help lift Tony up out of the sand, trying to prevent him from getting any more hurt than he already was. Of course, Bucky was talking at a mile a minute, angrily ranting while Steve cradled Tony in his arms, silently praying that the chopper moved faster.
“Last time I checked, I didn’t have a test tube baby, Tasha,” Tony replied hesitantly, taking the papers.
“I do not know how she died,” He said in a very small, scared voice, “But Pepper smelled so strongly of blood that I cannot help but assume she hemorrhaged. If we had been able to go to a doctor, she might still be alive, but--”
He smiled and petted the baby’s cheek with a fingertip, his face softening at Peter’s gurgle. Without thinking, he brought the baby up to kiss his cheek and nose at his temple. A sharp breath from next to him caused him to freeze and pull back.
“It is no excuse, though. I should… I should be able to control my jealousy and not be so strung-up when I see other Alphas ogle you and your body.”
Rhodey pursed his lips and regarded him with a singular raised eyebrow. He opened his mouth to speak, then wisely closed it. Without saying anything more, he stood and left them to join the others’ huddle across the room.
“That’s Wanda, she’s a witch and can move things with her mind. You already know Sam and Bucky, then that’s Clint. He does archery and likes purple. And finally, this is Pepper. She’s Tony’s best friend. She does paperwork for us sometimes, but she mostly keeps Tony sane,” Natasha was saying, pointing out each person to PJ as he giggled.
“Hey,” Steve’s voice called before the Captain’s face poked around the side of the recliner, “How is he?”
PJ giggled more, nodding as he bounced on Tony’s lap. He couldn’t help but smile down at the child, tucking a stray curl behind the boy’s ear. If he could keep that smile, that laugh, that
The door creaked open and a familiar mop of brown hair appeared, instantly relaxing both Tony and Steve.
“Sleep, little rabbit. You have had a rough morning,” he said quietly, gently rubbing circles on Tony’s stomach, “Sleep will--”
“Can you explain the whole mixing-Avengers-DNA thing again?” Scott piped up from the couch, “They were, what, trying to make the ultimate Avenger?”
Tony sighed happily and stole a few more kisses, relishing in the warmth that pooled in his gut. He desperately wanted to have Steve now, but he wanted to get locked in, which meant waiting for a longer stretch of time to be together.
“Leave him alone, he is just fond of his son,” Rhodey said to settle the room, “Go back to your conversations.”
“I only meant that he is of your flesh and blood and not of mine,” he explained, “You have a bond with him that I do not, and losing
“You’re okay, you’re okay, the chair’s just going backward. You won’t fall,” Tony quickly soothed, “The chair just lets you lay down instead of sit. I thought we could lay down while we read, yeah? In case you get tired and want to take a nap.”
Croissants, lasagna, pad Thai, moo goo gai pan—whatever he could find, he tried, and more often than not, he liked it. Being able to taste new, rich, and exotic flavors was addicting, and being able to blame his consumption on his new metabolism was an incredible bonus.
Tony cried out and rolled his hips down, finally getting his arms out from behind him to wrap back around Steve’s neck, distantly aware of trying to avoid the cut on the back of his head.
“Their cocks will feel like fingers compared to mine,” Steve interrupted, moving the arm that was holding Tony down to abruptly shove two fingers into him, “It is a good thing you get wet so easily... I am not sure there is enough oil in the world to slick you up enough to be ready for me.”
“The point of the exercise is to see how well we know each other. The better we understand each other, the more cohesive we’ll be on the field,” Steve answered from his spot on the floor, “Right?”
“My friends! It is good to see you in good health,” he said in the Southern language, “How was our homeland while we were gone?”
The end of the bed sunk down and he tensed, waiting for the blows to start. First, the furs on his feet were shuffled up, then a warm hand carefully closed around his ankle, steadying without being too tight. The hand slid down and cupped the side of his foot, and before Tony could wonder if Steve was going to attempt to literally tear him in half, a second hand cupped the other side of his foot and two thumbs pressed into the skin, slowly contra-rotating.
“…Did he just get jealous?” Tony asked, looking between the boy and Pepper, “I did just see that, right?”
Seeing Thor using Mjolnir as an airplane-directing stick, Tony breathed a sigh of relief, placing a hand on the back of the child’s head in pseudo-protectiveness as the team watched the Avengejet slowly land in front of the compound. Once the ramp into the plane had been lowered, SHIELD agents streamed out, beginning their assessment of the area.
And yet, if all Tony was willing to give him right now was this, he was going to take it, treasure it, hold it in his memory as he waited out the days until he earned Tony’s trust and consent.
Natasha sighed, but she did not argue with him and took Peter and the wrap when proffered up to her. Tony carefully stood up and watched them walk back down the hall, waiting until they were gone to go over to Steve. He sat back down by the bars and waited for the Alpha to look over at him.
“Razor, razor,” he muttered to himself as he rummaged around the bathroom, opening every cabinet until he found what he wanted, “Aha! Razor.”
Tony unknotted the t-shirt and slipped it off PJ, hurrying his movements once the boy started to shiver. With quick instructions and oversight from Natasha, he managed to get the boy to cooperate with the training pants and small jeans, then the Black Widow tee and a tiny zip-up grey hoodie.
Forcing himself through the pain, Tony took a look around, letting his eyes adjust to the room lit only by his arc reactor. Slowly, the past few hours’ memories trickled into his brain, and he froze, realizing a second body was missing.
“What? What just happened?” he mumbled to himself, “What did they put in that numbing? I’m not imagining this, right? He totally didn’t just go quietly.”
Parting ways, Tony made his way down to the elevator, shifting PJ slightly so the boy was leaning against his chest. Still extremely concerned, Tony groused at how the slow the elevator was, mildly cursing at it as it opened onto the medical wing. As requested, a few nurses with a hospital bed were standing by, ready to help get PJ settled. As they whisked the boy away, a nurse sat Tony down with a packet of forms, reassuring him that he could go see PJ once the paperwork was done.
Steve’s eyes widened and filled with tears as Thor translated; he began to openly cry and nodded, clutching at Tony’s bare legs as he buried his face in his inner knee. Tony shook his head fondly and sunk his hand into Steve’s braid, tugging strands of hair loose.
Realizing Steve had reached over to carefully play with the lock of blond hair in PJ’s curls, Tony swallowed the lump in his throat, trying to determine whether or not his hesitation was from guilt or self-loathing.
“Ha-ha, hilarious,” He grunted back, rifling through the cabinets to find the cocoa, “I know how to do many things, Captain Rogers, and I’ll have you know that I am an
stay here like some feeble housewife while my city is ravaged! What will my people think if you parade me and the baby in later? I will be nothing but a bonded Omega when that throne and those people are my responsibility.”
. I don’t know what Zola did to him while I was passed out, so we’re taking him to medical to get checked out. That’s the responsible thing to do, and you know it, so drop it,” he eventually snapped, looking into the rearview mirror to make eye contact with the Captain.
“PJ? Hey, hey baby, wake up, it’s okay, you’re having a bad dream,” Tony coaxed, sliding them both down onto the floor in case the boy had an attack, “Honey? C’mon, you can wake up, I got you, it’s okay—”
“Perhaps some medication would help the pain, Captain?” Vis suggested, making himself phase as the others entered the jet to strap in for the ride home.
Turning, Tony smiled, pulling Steve with him so they could sit on the edge of PJ’s bed. He hushed the boy softly, reaching up to sift his fingers through the boy’s hair.
“He’s a good kid,” Steve murmured, causing Tony to stand up and give him a surprised look, “He’ll need time, but I think he’ll be okay.”
“I—uh—no, I just, y’know, the kid likes him,” Tony stammered, ignoring Clint’s shit-eating grin, “Fine. Take Steve. I can hold down the fort with Bruce and Wanda.”
He rubbed his forehead and left his hand over his eyes, pretending that his shoulders weren’t hitching with every sob that fell from his lips. Tony,
“Shh, Tony,” Steve sighed, lazily turning his head to smile at him, “It’s alright. Enjoy the moment.”
Tiny fingers reached up to grab at his beard and he smiled, gently pulling the digits away so he could kiss them as well. Tony bid Rhodey goodbye and headed out to the hall, unsurprised to see Steve leaning against the wall with his cloak. He held his hand out and the Prime handed it over with a grunt.
Steve choked a watery laugh into his neck, and by the familiar, father-like smile and nod from the doorway, Tony knew he’d done the right thing, even if it might bite his ass later.
“Because the other option is to kill us? You won’t do that. He’s too important to you, and you know that the instant you kill me, he’ll stop cooperating, not to mention you’ll have to deal with the other Avengers’ wrath.”
“Ha-ha, Tony. That’s hilarious,” He hummed, looking over in Tony’s lap at the babe, “So. Child. Explain.”
“If it were up to me, I would not attack at all,” Tony said in a quiet voice, “Howard is an old king, and if you wait long enough, he will die and I can return as the rightful heir to the throne without causing any unnecessary bloodshed.”
“I’m here, I’m here! Thor can you—oh. Uh—Clint, go get me a piece of the quinjet wing. Something flat to put over the fire.”
young, I didn’t think I was ready to have a kid, and with all of Afghanistan still fresh in my mind, I wasn’t mentally ready, either. That really spurred the first time we split. So, to win her back, I read every highly rated parenting manual I could find. Then, once I fully came to terms with the whole anxiety-and-depression shit, I read as much as I could on abused and traumatized kids to see how my past would affect my future.”
“I trust the Prime has taken care of you both well so far?” he asked, smiling at Peter when the baby peeked out from Tony to look at him, “He is…concerned that he has not been treating you properly in the way you need. Is there something you need from him? It will be easiest for me to tell him in his language.”
“Love, please eat,” Tony almost begged, “You will feel much better and then we can sleep the day away, I just need you to drink, yeah? Usually, you do not fuss so much—perhaps you are ill too? Maybe Banner was—”
He sucked in a breath, eyes widening once he saw how dilated his pupils were; without hesitating, Tony ducked his head, pressing kisses along Steve’s
fathered a child, and now he would have to have another, by his own body? The thought brought harsh tears to his eyes, so he tucked his head down into Peter’s shoulder and took calming breaths, soaking in the baby’s pleasant scent.
Truth be told, he was quite exhausted from the day, despite having slept most of it away in a sick stupor. As he sat down on his bed, Tony realized he was still wearing Steve’s shirt. He picked up the hem of it and stared, but eventually he shrugged and crawled under his furs, figuring that if Steve had made no mention of it before he was welcome to still wear it. He made himself comfortable and adjusted his pillows but still felt restless, tossing and turning until Steve emerged from the bathroom. Thankfully, he had the furs tugged up enough that Steve would not have been able to see his gaze, so he was free to stare at his sculpted glutes.
“His mother was a local woman. Mary. A farmer’s daughter,” Tony said quietly, reaching up to stroke the back of his finger down Peter’s cheek, “She was one of the smartest people I have ever met. It was difficult for her, since Howard put so many gendered rules into place. We found camaraderie in her seeking knowledge and my need for validation in going against my father’s wishes. She picked up math and science easily, and we worked on various projects together, but we never thought of each other in a romantic sense. Even if it was not forbidden, we were friends, nothing more.”
be my favorite. It’s the flavor I got when we went to Coney Island and I threw up on the rollercoaster, Buck. I thought you knew that.”
He stood and leaned over the table to kiss Steve’s forehead and cheek, squeezing his shoulder before hurrying out of the room like a bat out of hell. Steve watched him go, worry making him nibble his lip as he turned back to the box in front of him. Curiosity won out and he lifted the lid, immediately comforted by the familiar musk of old books. He reached in and pulled out composition books, some yellowed with age and others slightly tattered with use, each labeled and dated. Confused, he chose the oldest of the books to pick up first.
“No, not at all,” Steve said hesitantly, “But it hurts now, and if it hurts less after, then I’ll do it.”
“That is quite an extensive list, darling, but I think you also forgot ‘exquisite and handsome’,” Tony quipped, “And I did not know that you
“It smells like Steve,” he explained quietly, “He will not go down without it if he is not there to rock him to sleep.”
Steve merely raised a hand up to the babe’s cheek, shakily stroking his thumb over the soft skin. Then, Tony swore he saw a ghost of a smile on his lips as he pulled his hand away. Steve nodded, turned on his heel, grabbed up his shield from beside his chair and left the room as silently as he had entered. They all watched him leave before Bucky and Sam scrambled to their feet, chasing after him. Tony merely staggered backward toward the fireplace, sitting down on the raised edge of the brickwork. He carefully maneuvered PJ to be sitting in his lap, still stroking the boy’s hair with a shaky hand.
Steve looked up at him with hopeful, wide eyes. Gods, he was precious, like a puppy begging for scraps. Somewhere, deep in the recess of his subconscious, Tony noted that he most likely would not be able to say no to Steve if he pulled that face more often. He reached up to smooth out the crease between Steve’s brows, then smiled as he leaned in for a languid kiss. Steve groaned into his mouth and practically melted under his lips; Tony could feel the heat start to pool in his gut at the Alpha’s noises. Reluctantly, he pulled away.
“Tell him eventually, I know,” Tony finished, slumping down on a chair nearby, “I will. But let’s get the kid into some sort of healthy place, first. Yeah? Please, Brucie bear?”
It was undeniable how gorgeous the Alpha looked. The light accentuated each curve and bulge of his muscles and drew attention to his sharp jawline, etherealizing him in a way that perhaps only a full moon could have had a chance to replicate. He was a god among men, even if his less-than-confident stance suggested otherwise. Momentarily, Tony wondered that if he stared much longer his eyes would burn out, like those before him that had had the opportunity to gaze upon angels.
“We are headed back to Ma’atan. If Stark’s army is here, then it is not there and we have a safe house,” Rhodey said, “If you come, look for the orange house with a red-tiled roof in the third quadrant of the city. That is where we will be.”
Tony immediately teared up, and once he got Natasha off of his lap, sprinted over to Miss Hill, tugging on her pant leg to get her to stop.
“I’m going to talk to the nurse about discharge,” he said evenly, steeling himself to not look at Steve as he changed the subject, “I’ll return.”
you are ready,” Steve said again, turning his head to kiss Tony and nip at his bottom lip, “You beg so well, but I am not budging on that.”
It was bad enough that when he went home that evening, Maria had taken one look at him and asked if Steve was okay.  He’d ignored her and went to his room—it was almost worth the beating he received later that night for being rude.
“Hey, we gotta go, kiddo, okay?” Tony whispered to PJ, hearing the boy fuss as he woke up, “You go right back to sleep. I’ll carry you.”
He glared at Steve’s beaming smile, gently laying Peter down on the Alpha’s bed so he could don the clothing. To be fair, the bra was not uncomfortable, but the band was tight enough that he could feel it whenever he moved. His cheeks had gone from warm to burning hot with embarrassment and he swallowed the urge to thank Steve for the clothing. Instead, he silently scooped Peter back up into his arms, smiling when the baby attempted to grab at his chest hair but had to settle for his shirt collar.
“Do you know how the armor is made?” Tony asked, peering at one of the breastplates still left on a mannequin.
to tell you…this is probably one of the best surprises we could have had. I mean, it doesn’t mean I’m not going to kick Fury’s ass once I get you tucked back home, but I’m really, really relieved. I should have known, y’know. You’re the smartest fella this side of the galaxy, of
A muffled ‘got it’ came through the wall, so Tony relaxed back into the bed, noisily humming as he finished off his breakfast and half of the pot of coffee. He moved the tray to the bedside table, scooting himself out of the nest of blankets and bedsheets to get himself ready for the day, already grinding away possibilities in his head for ways to help Shuri scan through the Sahara base they had located. By the time he was dressed with the last cup of coffee in his hand, Tony realized that Steve still wasn’t back, and went to check on him.
Tony grimaced. “I think he is cranky from not having me around, but other than that, he is fine. Bathtime went about as it usually does. Your turn?”
, and he barely got his arm down in time to brace himself against the table when his knees gave out. Steve was on him in an instant, grabbing his hips to help keep him upright.
“Hey, take it easy. I just had to patch you up. You lost a bit of blood, so you’re going to be woozy.”
Tony hushed him and pulled his fingers away so he could move them toward the edge of the lake where large, flat stones covered the ground. Thankfully, they were big enough to fit two grown men, albeit slightly uncomfortably. Steve did not seem to care, as he scrambled out of the water to present himself on his hands and knees for Tony, looking back at him over his shoulder with hazy eyes. Gods, he looked stunning with his skin all slick and dripping, shining under the sun. Tony’s mouth watered and he finally moved up to kneel behind him, eagerly kneading the Prime’s asscheeks and spreading them apart.
Tony closed his eyes and tried to relax, forcing himself to think of something else: his friends at home, Peter, anything to get the thought of Howard out of his mind. Slowly, his body loosened, and he felt Steve begin to relax as his scent changed.
“Tha’s it, fill me up,” Tony slurred, somehow picking up his arm to be able to pet Steve’s hair, “Good boy, did so well, takin’ such good care a’me, talked so pretty, too…”
Once his blurry vision settled, Tony smiled, relief washing over his body at the familiar man sitting next to his bed.
“Me either,” he admitted, “God, I can’t—I don’t want to accept it. He never deserved any of it, and I can’t help but feel as though it's my fault, y’know? I could’ve found them earlier, could’ve worked harder—”
“Alright, Bruce, what do you think Thor said was your most irritating habit?” Natasha interrupted, flicking a balled-up piece of paper at Bucky.
He tapped the bedrail next to PJ before heading out, leaving Tony and Steve fairly stunned in his wake. After a second, the child sat up with a whine, slipping his thumb into his mouth as he looked over at Steve pitifully.
Tony nodded dumbly and clutched at Peter, staring off at the horizon as looming walls came into view. He had never heard anything about the Warlords having a structured town; as far as he knew, they lived in thatch huts, not in a clearly sophisticated city. His mouth fell open as the carriage drew closer, allowing him to see the detailed gargoyles and carvings done on the outer stone walls, displaying a type of artistic talent that in his own city was usually reserved for just the palace. Once they were through the large iron gates, he felt his breath whoosh from his lungs, completely taken aback by what he saw. It was a bustling hub, full of all types of people selling their wares and mingling on the streets. Spices wafted through the air, making his mouth water and stomach rumble as people moved past them with baskets of various foods perched on their heads.
Suddenly, the bond began to flare enough to catch his attention; curious, Tony closed his eyes and concentrated on it, feeling Steve’s drowsiness as he began to wake. Impatient, Tony prodded at the bond, feeling Steve go from drowsy to awake in seconds. Confusion filtered through, and then deep sadness and guilt, bad enough to cause Tony to open his eyes and gasp. Peter made a curious noise and grabbed at his dad’s shirt, no doubt also sensing Steve.
. It was just a nightmare. You’re safe with me,” Tony murmured as they walked, silently hoping that it was late enough that no one would be out.
“No. It’s—ah—it’s part of your gift,” Tony explained, setting the box on the table but not sliding it over, “I know—I know we don’t exchange physical gifts, but I’ve been thinking about this one for a while, and—”
“Alright! We are going. You, back to bed,” Tony said abruptly, standing up and pointing at Steve, “You are still in trouble with me for this morning, so do
“Okay, your turn to get hard,” he said, wheezing out his laughter at Steve’s embarrassed sputtering.
“I want a bit of time with him,” he said softly, kissing Peter’s cheek for good measure before unwrapping the baby from his chest, “Take Peter up to Thor and Bruce and I will be up shortly.”
The silence in the room was deafening but was unable to capture the bone-deep grief that the men had to swallow.
Peter only gurgled in response, tucking his head into Tony’s neck. He almost cried at how cute his baby was and kissed Peter’s cheek, rubbing circles on his back as he rocked them back and forth.
“Hey, I’m okay, bud. Just got a little scared for a second,” Tony soothed, putting his palm up for the boy, “Don’t worry. I’m okay. I promise.”
“If it prevented it, the liquid wouldn’t be oxygenated,” Natasha pointed out, looking around the room for a control box.
“Either way, we know what happens when bonded couples do not attend to each other’s rut or heat. We need a solution to have them together without the risk,” Bucky cut in, no longer having to strain against Steve’s escape attempts, “What does Bruce know? Is there something you can use to...”
He waited to hear the shuffle of footsteps disappear before turning to look, seeing that Natasha and Bruce had moved to a couch and that the others had left. Sighing thankfully, Tony turned back to PJ, seeing the kid still sniffling.
Tony laughed while pulling an almost-asleep Peter from his breast, rearranging his clothes so he could lean the babe against his chest to pat his back.
And in that moment, hearing how genuine and honest Steve was, combined with the small child fast asleep on his chest, clinging to his stuffed elephant for dear life, Tony could only find one phrase stuck in his genius brain.
“I hope if you are there, things will go over more smoothly,” he said to the baby, dancing them around the room, “Perhaps they will be kinder if a babe is present.”
“Well, honeybear, Dad needs help with setting up for the Expo, so I’ve been working in his lab,” Tony had lied, flashing Rhodey one of his trademark smiles, “Have you missed me?”
Holy shit, I can’t believe you guys waited so long to admit it—oh, he’s going to get a kick out of this when he wakes up—”
The question’s implication ran deeper than the Alpha was letting on. Sure, he worried about them, about this budding
. You—I dunno, you were supposed to get angry and punch me, or something,” he said, his own eyes clearly shiny in the light, “Honey, you’re going to make
“I don’t know if he swings for the other team, too,” He continued, averting his gaze, “That, and we’re… close. I don’t want to make him uncomfortable when all he’s done is help me adjust and feel more at home here—plus, if he doesn’t return my feelings, it could make work awkward and strained, but I want to make it work
“Yeah. Sorry. Just…thinking,” he murmured, “I’m gonna put this away and get my backpack. Meet you out front?”
“Not too bad. I think he gets upset when you’re not there, though,” Steve answered quietly, “He definitely is more attached to you.”
“If you were on time, you would be,” Tony answered back, rolling his eyes again, “After you, Capsicle. You can set off any booby traps for us.”
“What--what has happened since I have been gone?” He asked, translating quickly for Steve to keep him in the loop.
“Scary?” Tony said, turning onto his side as PJ curled up to him, reaching up to tug on his shirt over his reactor, “Yeah. I kinda get that. Though, I mean, you’re
“Steeeve,” Tony whined softly, pouting up at the other from under his long eyelashes, “Trapping me here to compliment me isn’t
“You are already so swollen, baby. Are you going to knot for me? I want to see you knot and come all over your pretty chest.”
Just as he managed to get his arms around the boy, PJ let out an ear-splitting scream, fat tears starting to roll down his face once he realized he was being taken away. Steve winced at the noise but didn’t let go, carrying the thrashing child out of the room. As soon as they were gone, Tony turned to the nurse, nodding for her to continue.
“Yes. I’ll stay put,” Steve answered, turning to clasp Rhodey’s hand, “Go save the world, Colonel. I can play house until it’s safe to go.”
PJ glared at Bucky from where he was tucked into Tony’s side, only to turn his gaze toward Natasha. He smiled bashfully, putting his face back into Tony’s side when she waved at him.
“What the hell are you doing?” Steve asked, not at all apologetic that Tony was startled, yelping as he dropped his screwdriver on his foot.
“This is troublesome, for sure,” T’Challa commented, looking more focused than usual, “An army of even
Steve heard Tony choke on the other side of the line and rolled his eyes fondly, wishing Tony could see him shake his head.
Tony sat up, ignoring PJ’s whine for the moment so he could put his hand on Steve’s shaking shoulder, giving it a gentle squeeze.
It took a few minutes, but soon the child was only crying into Tony’s shoulder, shaking a bit from the outburst. Tony grabbed up a blanket off the back of the couch, and with a quick few movements, bundled PJ up and set him on the couch.
Steve guided them into the dining hall, where a feast of a breakfast had been laid out. Clearly, most of the others had eaten already, as large swathes of empty plates littered the tables. Unfazed, Steve pulled out Tony’s usual chair for him, pushing him in once he had settled down. Surely, he thought he would have been used to the odd chivalry the Prime displayed, but Tony still found himself surprised, turning around slightly to watch the man begin filling new plates with food.
“If you happen to think of anything that could maybe cheer him up, let us know,” he muttered, clearly unamused, “It’s not often he lets us see him this upset.”
Peter did not seem to care much, as he fisted his hands in Tony’s chest hair to keep himself anchored as close as possible. Tony sighed and attempted to dress himself, only managing underwear and pants before having to guide Peter away so he could dress the baby.
Tony cursed under his breath and slammed on the accelerator, shifting into fourth then fifth gear as he sped along.
Rhodey shot him a glare that Tony avoided looking at directly. They both knew he was probably lying, but he did not want to admit it out loud. He could control his biology, damn it; he would
“Tony, easy. You had an attack,” the doctor said calmly, smiling when Tony met his gaze, “There you are. You scared Thor and Steve, you know. You were practically unresponsive on your way back to the castle…what happened out there?”
Steve nodded and ducked down to kiss him, ignoring the strangled noise coming from the other side of the table.
Following Natasha in, Tony flipped his faceplate up, unable to drag his eyes away from the sight in front of him.
“Is it time for a language lesson, Doctor?” Tony asked once they left the bedroom and had closed the door.
He laid back down and held his arms out, glaring at Steve until he relented and joined him. He laid down on his belly, half on top of Tony and half on the bed. It was a dominant position, to hold Steve and have his face pressed into his neck, but Tony could not find it in himself to care. All he wanted was for the lingering burnt scent in the air to dissipate and for their bond to not feel so heavy.
“I’ll go get you food and a drink, and send it in with Steve and the kid. Which, by the way, you still need to explain his existence to me. I wasn’t exactly expecting to wake up the other day with a godson,” Rhodey grunted, flicking Tony’s ear, “Not only that, but I heard it through
PJ scrambled up onto the bed, shoes long been forgotten since Tony forbid them on the nice bedding. He giggled as he started to jump around, only to wheeze and collapse down onto the bed with more breathy giggles. Turning up to look at Tony, he smiled softly, eyes blinking slowly before they slipped shut.
; after just a few minutes, Tony found himself relaxing against Steve’s chest, humming softly when a hand carded itself through his hair.
It took both Bucky and Rhodey to convince Steve to sit down and put on his seatbelt. They sat on either side of him, tense and ready to throw their backs out if they were going to have to keep him seated. Steve knew this; he recognized their movements, saw how they both leaned in a little closer than necessary, their hands tight and ready for a fight. Looking over at Tony, strapped to a board and unmoving, he knew that he had no qualms with breaking either man’s arms in order to get to him if something went wrong.
Steve narrowed his eyes and kept it held out, so Tony snatched it from him and tossed it over his shoulder to land somewhere behind him on the floor. Offended, Steve glared at him and marched over to pick it up, holding it out to him again.
“Wh—mercy?” Tony asked, listening to Thor translate to Steve, “Why mercy? I—I get now that he is naïve, and I think he understands to not do such things again, but mercy?”
“I will be quick, I promise,” Steve said as he settled on the end of the bed, moving the furs up to Tony’s waist, “Can you hold yourself open for me?”
“I really do not know if you will be able to take me, let alone my knot,” he finally admitted, “I want to do as much as I can to open you up so we can try, okay?”
Steve turned and raised his brow, then pointed at the table to the side of his bed. He retrieved a small lidded bowl from inside the drawer of the table and returned to the bed, crawling back under the furs but sitting upright. Tony peered at the bowl and Steve obligingly opened the lid, smiling when Tony leaned in to carefully smell it. He eyed the oily mixture suspiciously, not expecting it to be…sweet.
“I--no, you did nothing wrong. You are fine,” he answered, patting the hand on his cheek, “I promise.”
“You’re right. I haven’t. I read…before,” He explained carefully, “When Pepper and I were together, we sort of…had a scare. First and last time barebacking. I kind of freaked out. I was young,
“I--sorry, sorry. I do not understand what you need,” Tony said shakily as he forced himself to move back to the bars, where Steve could touch him.
“Uh—” Steve paled slightly and coughed, shrugging, “Sort of? I always carry some water with me, so I used half of it to wash out the tannings.”
“O-okay, okay, if you are sure,” Steve said, pulling Tony back in to hold him and Peter close, “If you change your mind by tonight, it is okay. I do not want you to feel pressured.”
And then he just had to fucking wake up, didn’t he? He heard himself groan, his head was swimming, so he moved to clutch at it, only to have his hand be stopped by a force around his wrists. Recognizing the leather cuffs, Tony’s eyes snapped open, taking in the hospital room, the bed he was bound to, the nauseating smell of antiseptic in the air, Bucky by his bed and holding one hand over his chest—
And here he was, running straight into that same man’s hands, hoping that the enemy would be more accepting than his own father.
“It will feel strange for a while,” Tony said as he juggled eating with a curious, handsy baby, “It will take a bit to get used to.”
son,” he continued quietly, tightening his grip on Tony’s hand, “I wish I could tear his throat out, but making sure he doesn’t hurt anyone else will have to do.”
“Patch them through, JARVIS,” Tony called to his AI, only to gasp when a familiar face popped up in full HD on his television.
A few of them chorused hellos, but Pepper stepped up to the front of the group, her hand jutted out for a handshake.
“I know that,” he said evenly, “But I also bore witness to their fighting and already stitched one of them up. Forgive me for
He turned to bid Thor goodnight, but the linguist had somehow left them without him noticing. That meant that he and Steve were alone again and judging by the body language of the Alpha, they were going to be dancing around each other again if he did not take the initiative to comfort Steve.
Peter reached out and grabbed onto the leather piece, giving it a few good tugs before Tony gently peeled his fingers away. He fussed for a moment, but Tony quickly kissed his cheek and hefted him up to his shoulder to more easily bounce him around the room.
tired of Fury using us like marionettes, damn the consequences,” Steve growled, bringing Tony’s hand up to his lips to kiss gently.
Then, the world tried to end, he found out he wasn’t exactly alone in his weirdness, his things were shuffled around, and he found himself trying to not only navigate the 21st century, but navigating it in a completely weird environment with nothing even remotely familiar to soothe him.
Carefully smoothing the photo back into the album, Tony flipped to the next page, finding another picture of him and Steve, holding their mouths open to show the camera where they had simultaneously lost the same tooth. Each picture after that was the same; except for the one picture of him holding up his acceptance letter to MIT with a smirk, they were all of him and Steve, him with a drawing Steve made him, him waiting at the bus stop for Steve even though they had a chauffeur…
“Hey, y’know, why don’t we get you cleaned up first. I bet you’re uncomfortable like this,” Tony said aloud, looking over at Steve, “Papa’s gonna go get Uncle Clint to help clean up in here while I get you all ready for bed, okay? No need to be upset.”
“Fourteen-year-olds don’t need to sleep with a stuffed animal either, but you don’t see me getting rid of Mr. Rabbit,” Tony said softly, squeezing Steve’s arms, “It’s okay, Steve. You know we’ve all got your back.”
troublemaker. You know full well I’d never pick Bucky over you. He’s not even my type,” he said dismissively, waving his hand.
“Tony?” Steve asked quietly, his voice shuddering from the chill of the room and snapping Tony out of his thoughts.
He waited for the room to clear before collapsing into a nearby chair, hand over his mouth. Staring into the distance, Tony choked back a cry, tears that had been stinging his eyes for the past few minutes now budding up and falling down his cheeks. He wiped them away with the back of his hand, pinching the bridge of his nose to force himself to take a deep breath, in and out.
He offered no other explanation, simply waving him toward the bathroom. Thankfully, Steve had apparently relit all the candles already, so Tony had no trouble with stumbling into the next room. He quickly splashed water on his face, staring at himself in the mirror above the small basin. The skin under his eyes was dark and his cheeks were slightly gaunt, accentuated by his scraggly goatee and unkempt hair. He fixed the latter with water, smoothing it down to try and make himself look presentable when a knock on the door dragged him out of his thoughts.
“Maybe I will take a nap myself,” Tony admitted, petting Peter’s fine hairs, “All of this excitement has worn me out.”
“We should clear this with Steve first,” Bucky grunted, still eyeing the layout plans, “But I think you’re right. This might just be the main facility, and underground tunnels wouldn’t show on the scans. There might be old mine shafts under the sand, or possibly—”
“I do not think I could, even if I tried,” he admitted, “My head is filled with thoughts of protecting you and the baby. I need to silence my mind if I want to truly rest.”
“Yeah, I meant you,” Tony sighed, going over to his favorite recliner, “Alright, we’re going to sit down, okay? My old man legs are tired already and you’re squirmy with being held. Ready?”
The Warlord looked over at him, then back to Natasha, and nodded. It was silent for a moment as she considered him. She let go of his arm and nodded back, stepping to the side to skirt around him and leave.
He looked away before he could see Tony’s reaction, closing his eyes to try and block out the negative reaction he was sure to get. Rather, he felt a hand rest on his knee and fingers on his chin, turning his head back toward Tony.
“Back when I was a tot and still able to sit on my mother’s knee, she let me help her take care of any of the children that came to the castle. She taught me how to hold them and soothe them, especially when it came to Omegas. She had me think about my happiest memories, my favorite sweets, and other things of that nature. I do not remember if she told me the reason as to why I was supposed to do that… I would have been too young to understand it anyway.”
“I don’t—I don’t want to be what we were, either,” he said, rubbing the rest of the tears off of his face, “If we’re getting it all out there. I don’t. Peggy—I realized—fuck, Tony. I was attracted to her because she was you with curves and when I realized she just wasn’t you I—”
Shivers ran down his spine. Heat still consumed him, and with a choked gasp he realized he had soaked the sheets between the legs. He clumsily reached up to grab the cloth over his eyes and flung it away so he could look down at his body. His skin shined with sweat and his cock lay hard and wanting against his thigh. He quickly realized that the soaked sheets were due to his slick, but the pain in his bones overrode any embarrassment he may have felt. Gods, he needed
Tony nodded, then shook his head, only to pause and turn his head up and purse his lips. Laughing, Steve leaned down to kiss him once, so he would settle back down. Satisfied that Tony was settled, he reached over the side of the bed to pull out the last notebook; it was definitely the newest of all of them, seeing that the binding was still fairly pristine. However, some of the pages were warped on the inside and definitely smelled of old alcohol. Steve checked the name and date on the front.
