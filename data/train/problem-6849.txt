"You do?" asked Natasha. "Have you experienced a vision as well?"
"Would you be opposed to me saying that I
"Not yet, sir," answered JARVIS. "Apparently your suggestion of a nap was indeed a good one."
"Who says I was trying?" Steve asked, his cheeky grin growing even wider as his fingers curled around Tony's hipbones. Tony groaned as Steve licked him again, his hands gripping Steve's hair and his entire body tingling like it was ready to short-circuit.
"Funny I should say, what, Papa?" Peter asked.
Steve‚Äî
Tony shook his head, squeezing his eyes closed as he hugged Peter even tighter. "Oh hell, buddy, you already do more than enough," he said. "And you're just a kid, you shouldn't have to be concerned about all this damn adult stuff."
Or Steve. He was a lot of fun to have around too, and he didn't constantly look at Peter as if he was going to suddenly burst into flame either, which was nice. Peter was getting really tired of people acting like he was going to crumble into pieces if they happened to look at him wrong.
"Now you're just trying to change the subject," Steve whispered as he leaned close enough to kiss the tip of Tony's nose. "Please, tell me what's on your mind?"
"Probably not," agreed Ned. "It is a pretty cool car though, even if I'd never admit it to his face. Oh, and my mom found something out the other day at one of her book clubs. Apparently there's a new deputy police chief in our area, and he's got a daughter who'll be starting at Midtown in our class." He paused dramatically, leaning in closer. "And according to my mom's friend, this girl's supposedly even smarter than you."
As soon as the office door clicked shut Tony reached for his phone, dialling the hospital.
"Well, I don't know,
Tony said through clenched teeth. "Now, shut the hell up and let's get this over with!"
this, and‚Äîand I
"You make it sound like just some little thing," Steve said into Tony's hair. "But you always end up doing the most of any of us, and I don't think we ever appreciate you enough. And for that, I'm so sorry."
Tony frowned, but closed his eyes anyway. "Long as your noisy stomach doesn't wake me up again,
Finally situated against the wall, Steve sucked in a slow breath, tipping his head back as he tried to get his sluggish mind to start working. His memory had been almost useless lately, too murky from pain and grief and dulled by never-ending hunger and thirst to function more than what was required for basic survival. He knew that HYDRA was drugging him, and the red-haired woman seemed to have some kind of mind-control powers as well, such that Steve had now developed an almost Pavlovian-like fear response to even the sight of her that most likely wasn't helping anything.
"Did Colonel Phillips mention if anyone had gotten a look at Bucky's aircraft yet?" Papa asked. "Do they know where the beam hit?"
"Colonel, what exactly are you saying?" Steve asked as a tear trailed down his cheek. "Are you saying that Peter's going to‚Äîthat he's gonna‚Äî?"
"JARVIS?" he forced out.
Peter raised his eyebrows as he took a sip of his milk, suppressing a shudder at the memory of seeing Dad and Papa's crumbling gravestones and watching Gwen fall to her death, the illusions Wanda had forced him to see while under HYDRA's influence. He had told Uncle Sam about them during one of their recent sessions but had so far kept them from his dads, not wanting their overprotectiveness to get any worse.
Steve pursed his lips, huffing as he glanced over at his husband. "Well, yeah, but‚Äî"
Peter thought as he scanned Thanos' line up and down, noting that they didn't seem at all confused by the pause in the battle.
"Fury was adamant that they got all of the Aminacin from the Miami bunker after the battle, babe, and all of the CTX-616 that was being housed here at Stark Industries has been destroyed," Tony said. "As for there potentially being other stocks of it somewhere else, though, it is a possibility. We know both Obie and Beck got their hands on it while it was here, and one or both of them might've transported some off-site, so‚Äî"
"Well, I guess we just have to assume that no news is good news in this case," said Natasha.
Peter gave a nod, both surprised and grateful that the lemon drop did seem to be calming his stomach a bit.
"Holy shit," he whispered. "It's like a deus ex machina, out of some goofy ancient sci-fi novel or something."
And with that Steve slid his beautifully large hands underneath Tony's ass and hoisted him into his arms, carrying him up the stairs to their bed and laying him down on the lightly perfumed sheets. He crawled up next to him, hovering over him as he stripped Tony's clothes off, his eyes flicking down to Tony's already straining erection before leaning down to kiss him.
He trails off, mumbling things about angles and force and pressure, finally pursing his lips as he looks up.
Carol gave a nod. "Yes. One of our former Kree operatives was working with him a few years ago, trying to obtain one of the Infinity Stones. Thanos didn't exactly take it well when he tried to deceive him."
‚ÄúYeah, sure.¬† Knock yourself out,‚Äù Tony said warily.¬† ‚ÄúBut I want you to let me know as soon as you find something, all right?¬† ‚ÄòCause if we‚Äôve got a glitch in the system somewhere, then‚Äî‚Äù
"Papa!" he cried as Dad pushed him over to his bed. Peter immediately reached for him, relieved when Papa pulled him into a careful hug.
"I'll let you know what Bruce and I come up with once we have a chance to take a look at his stuff, okay?" said Tony as he headed for the door. His patience with Nick Fury usually bordered on nonexistent, and he and Steve really did need to get going.
Steve tucked his pencil down inside the wires of his sketchbook and tipped his head back against the lounge chair, allowing the last remnants of the setting sun to wash over him, filling him with the warmth that he craved with every fibre of his being. The sketchbook resting on his lap was filled with drawings that he'd sketched over the course of the last few days, of his family enjoying themselves. He couldn't remember the last time he'd felt relaxed enough to draw like that, just for fun, like he always used to before‚Äî
Arriving back inside their tiny walkup, Steve watched as Little Steve helped Ma unpack the groceries before retreating to his bed to open his own package, once again running his palm across the crisp sketchbook cover like it was something to be treasured.
"Well, that's all the confirmation that I need then," Tony said quickly. "Long as you're in there with him."
"Don't, Mr Stark, you'll only make this worse," he said, so smugly that Tony had to fight the urge to punch his lights out. "I strongly suggest that you go home now."
No wonder Steve had told Tony so many times that he couldn't wait to meet Peter. It was because he'd already
"As long as you load your dishes into the dishwasher," said Steve.
"What the hell did you do to me last night?" he asked as he shuffled over to Steve and slid right onto his lap. "I think I must've passed out."
these guys, out there in space when I flew that missile out of New York. I saw how big their ship was before it blew up, and‚Äîand if that was only one part of their invading force, then‚Ä¶ I don't know how us learning more about a handful of rocks is gonna help anything."
"Then why the hell is his date for the dance here without him?" Tony snapped. "What the hell do they want?"
"You don't look like you did, though," Peter gently added. "You look really tired."
Thankfully, thanks to Tony and Peter‚Äôs unconditional love and acceptance, Steve didn't have to worry about his environment being unsafe.¬† Sam had spent quite a bit of time talking with Tony and Peter, offering them information on supporting someone recovering from PTSD, and had commented to Steve afterwards that he had never seen someone as inherently perceptive as Peter.
Peter's ears perked up. He'd gotten the impression from Papa that he didn't enjoy talking about his childhood all that much, and especially not to Peter, so aside from a few basic questions Peter hadn't asked him too much about it.
"Yes, but it also might mean he was trying to get in contact with someone before he faded away," Natasha insisted. "Which means we should look more into it."
"I said,
Steve glanced over at his husband, a soft smile stretching across his lips as he reached for Tony's hand. "To each their own, I suppose."
been the one who had discovered the location of the prison, which no doubt ended up saving not only Papa's life, but both of the Maximoffs as well.
"I thought that by eliminating half of life, the other half would thrive. But you've shown me that's impossible. And as long as there are those who remember what was, there will always be those who are unable to accept what can be. They will resist."
According to Uncle Bucky, apart from some pretty heavy dogfighting while Papa and Auntie Carol were flying towards space, the actual coup seemed to go off with only a couple minor hitches. General O'Brien and all of his government cronies were now locked up in the Air Corps brig, under guard by a bunch of soldiers loyal to Colonel Phillips, while the various bases and weapons facilities located along the former DMZ were being raided and catalogued by another squadron of soldiers. Uncle James had also reported just yesterday that Dad had finally managed to uncover a database hidden deep inside the Meridian computer systems that had been basically a massive library of Langaran blueprints and design schematics. The stuff in there dated all the way back to when Grandpa was still working for the Air Corps, allowing the Meridian government and its scientists complete access to any and all Langaran tech.
A huge thank-you to my wonderful betas jehbeeeh and allthesinnersandallthesaints, and also to adoctoraday for the gorgeous moodboard! üíó
"Because I'm the adult, and you're the child, child!" Dad said, barely shy of shouting. "And since this is an adult problem, it's up to the adults to handle it!"
As Tony and Steve had realised, when they discovered that Arnim Zola, the man behind the Project Insight algorithm, had been yet another of Howard's questionable SHIELD colleagues, recruited into the organisation by Howard himself.
Tony practically shrieked as Steve's index finger brushed across his prostate, sending spikes of hot pleasure shooting throughout his body. "Shit, baby, I'm already open enough! Just get inside me!"
"Okay, but why," Peter asked. "Just 'cause he's rich? Did people use to report on his comings and goings on a regular basis?"
"Um‚Ä¶"
Tony snapped.¬† ‚ÄúYou mean, not until you realised that Steve was missing?‚Äù
"Pete's got Sam and Bucky there with him, and as soon as Rhodey landed he hightailed it over there with three more soldiers to stand guard outside the house," said Tony. "So they should be good. Rhodey told me he's gonna rotate the soldiers every six hours so they don't get too tired."
"God, you're gorgeous," he whispered, his heart lurching when Steve blushed and gave him that soft,
"Hey," Tony whispered once they broke apart. "Do something for me, yeah?"
Peter watched as Image Papa‚Äôs face screwed into a frown, his fingers tightening on his arms.
"Shit, that was close!" Clint said as they reached the remains of the guard tower, ducking down behind it just in time to avoid another shot. "Where the hell are they firing from, there aren't any goddamn trees out here!"
"Already on it, Cap," Clint said as he launched an arrow just as the target dove down, aiming towards him. Sparks flew as it bounced three times, shedding parts before skidding to a halt.
Bucky shrugged, bobbing his head back and forth. "Yeah. Like I said, I've never seen you so goddamn googly-eyed over anyone before, so‚Ä¶ maybe the guy's better than his reputation says."
"You can call me Doctor List, Captain," the man said, far more politely than Steve would expect from an agent of HYDRA. The man gave a slight bow, placing his hand on the middle of the young woman's back. "And this is one of my colleagues, Ms Wanda Maximoff."
Thankfully, Steve‚Äôs saved from having to answer by the announcer.¬† ‚ÄúIn lane five, representing the United States of America, Steve Rogers!‚Äù
Peter groaned as he rolled over on his bed, clutching his polar bear to his chest. He had already ghosted Gwen three times already that day, and while he realised that it was probably very rude of him, he didn't really much care at the moment.
"Oh, this? Yeah, I did," answered Tony. "I like to tinker with cars, or at least, I did; don't really have the free time to do all that much of it anymore, and this lets me alter the air pressure in the increments that I like. Some of the older cars need to be babied a bit more than the newer ones, so‚Ä¶"
"How'd the presentation go?"
They had checked in with Peter earlier that morning while he was eating breakfast with Sam, making sure that he remembered to pack his gym clothes and an extra hoodie, as well as all the snacks he needed to keep his blood sugar even so he didn't pass out during Decathlon practise. Tony had suspected that he had hit yet another growth spurt while they were in Italy since he'd been eating nearly everything in sight, which likely meant that Steve would have to take him clothes shopping again soon.
Steve thought as he stepped into the shower, letting out a soft moan as the hot water pelted the tense muscles in his neck and shoulders. He and Tony had splurged on a couples' massage during their vacation in Ireland over the summer, and ever since then Tony had been encouraging Steve to get another, telling him that the constant tension he carried in his upper body was hindering his recovery.
But despite his attempt at bravado, as they made their way towards the bank of elevators, Tony was far more nervous than he wanted to admit. Out of all of the changes he'd made to the security systems at both the Tower and the Compound, having to deal with a possible threat that was the size of a goddamn bug was the one thing that had not occurred to him.
"I agree," Steve said as he gave Tony's hand a squeeze. "Let's go."
‚ÄúOh, shit,‚Äù he muttered under his breath as he quickly closed out the hologram.¬† Peter absolutely
And while Peter didn't really think he'd be engaging in any hand-to-hand combat anytime soon, especially since he considered himself more of a flyer like Dad instead of a foot soldier like Papa, he had noticed a definite decrease in his headaches since he'd started paying attention to his shoulder positioning, so it hadn't just been empty advice.
"Yeah, I guess so," Dad said with a heavy sigh. "I've made sure the range on the drones down there is long enough to target the competition site, so‚Ä¶ we'll just have to make sure that there's enough security inside the building."
"I'm here, sweetheart!" he forced past his clenched teeth, squeezing Tony's hand as tightly as he dared. "Tony, I'm here!"
To Peter's surprise, it was Uncle Sam and Auntie Nat waiting for him once school was over instead of his dads. Peter's heart leapt into his throat at the sight of them, partially because he still wasn't used to seeing Auntie Nat with her platinum blonde hair.
"It went well, bud. The pilots were all very excited about their shiny new toys."
"Peter, what is that?" Gwen cried into Peter's ear, gripping his arm as the fire monster let out an absolutely bellowing roar, one so loud it nearly blew Peter off his feet.
Except, he didn't.¬† After five rings, the call just disconnected, as Steve apparently hadn't bothered to set up his voicemail.
"You know I can, Buck."
"Copy that." Tony sighed as he rechecked his brand-new data pad, glancing over at Colonel Phillips who was leaning back in his chair about two metres away. Rhodey and Captain Wilson were also present in what Tony had named the Control Room, sitting off to the side.
And despite Bucky's concern that falling in love would somehow make him less of a pilot, it hadn't at all turned out to be the case. If anything, it had made both Bucky and Sam even better.
"Yeah, okay," Sam said as he got to his feet, stepping closer to the bed as an image appeared of Winter Soldier Bucky strapped to a metal chair, trembling in fear. Bucky jumped as he saw it, his head jerking back as though he'd been slapped as his Winter Soldier counterpart started to thrash against his restraints, begging the colonel to stop as he continued to advance towards him.
‚ÄúOkay, so‚Ä¶ are ya gonna just sit there and stare at me?‚Äù Tony had finally asked, crossing his arms.¬† ‚Äú‚ÄòCause in case you haven‚Äôt heard, we‚Äôve got a crisis going down in Sokovia at the moment, and‚Äî‚Äù
Tony waited until they were safely inside the car before turning to his mischievous son.¬† ‚ÄúSo, how long have you been planning that ambush, hmm?‚Äù he asked.¬† He should‚Äôve known that Peter had been just waiting for the perfect time to pounce.
"Well, it helps when we have such an awesome team," Gwen said, elbowing Peter on the arm. "I'm predicting that we'll win State this year."
"Sweetheart, it's just me," he murmured. "It's okay."
"Tony?" Steve gasped as he pulled back in alarm, his terror skyrocketing as he noticed that the slight rasp he'd heard in Tony's breathing the night before was much, much worse, his pyjamas pants were practically glued to him with sweat, and his skin tone had transformed into a sickly grey colour that human skin had no business being.
"Yeah, that's what I told him," said Tony. "But you know Pete."
‚Äîof a truly formidable enemy.
body, pressing kisses to his forehead and cheeks. "You're gonna be okay now."
"We did, Steve," said James. "It's still plugged in, it just‚Ä¶ stopped."
"Let's just try and sleep now, yeah? We can get back to work tomorrow." Tony pressed against Steve's scalp again, relieved when Steve's strong body started to relax.
Tony shrugged.¬† ‚ÄúPete was doing some research for school and asked me about it.¬† And since I hadn‚Äôt heard anything, I thought I‚Äôd ask you.‚Äù
"That's right, honey, I've got you. And as soon as we get you all fixed up we can go see Pete and make his entire year, okay?"
And it was probably not a good idea to try and mess with those factors in the heat of the moment. Or try and rewrite warp theory to better suit his purposes.
excited about it.
"That's correct," Tony said. "All right then, Captain Rogers, why don't you tell me what'll happen if you try and come in too late?"
At least for now.
‚ÄúMy math‚Äôs never off, and you know it,‚Äù Tony stated.¬† He twisted out of Obie‚Äôs grasp, rubbing at the tingling spot on his shoulder.¬† ‚ÄúAnd in case you‚Äôve forgotten,
In fact, Tony had half a mind to suggest to Steve that they do the same that night, once all of the fireworks were done and they got Peter off to bed.
"Longing," Sam said in a clear, firm voice, watching as Bucky's jaw twitched and his teeth clenched. "Rusted. Seventeen‚Äî"
"Well, I had to distract you somehow," Peter said triumphantly. "And it obviously worked."
Especially since it was his fault that Peter was sick in the first place.
"Oh, sure. Sorry," Steve said as he shoved the rest of his roll into his mouth, washing it down with the last of his superwater. Being caught out of quarters when the blackout hit was not something he needed to experience more than once.
"That's 'cause you're the big brave Captain," Tony had said, giving Steve one of those quirky smiles of his that he loved. Then he'd tilted his head, giving Steve such a perfect example of eager bedroom eyes that it had taken all of Steve's strength to kiss him one final time and say goodnight.
‚ÄúShh, Steve,‚Äù Tony whispers, brushing his fingers across Steve‚Äôs raggedy lips.¬† ‚ÄúI‚Äôm cold too.‚Äù
"Tony," Rhodey said quietly from next to him, his arms raised and aimed at the army squadron of suits assembled behind Hammer. He heard a
"Papa told me way back when we were still in Afghanistan that his doctors made him smoke cigarettes when he was little to help treat his asthma, which is just so totally ridiculous that it's, well, it's just
Steve," Tony said. "You and Pete, you both have all these grandiose ideas about saving the world and blah, blah, blah, but if either of you think that I'll be able to survive if something bad were to happen, then‚Äî"
Tony's brown eyes crinkled at the corners as he smiled. "Not a thing at the moment, hon. Just keep the kid happy, which you're damn good at."
Steve chuckled, showing that dimple again as he took a bite of his steak, and it was all Tony could do to not try and drag him off to the men's room right then and there. He didn't know if it was the fact that it was their anniversary dinner or what, but Steve was looking so incredibly gorgeous that evening in his perfectly tailored navy blue pinstripe suit that Tony could barely take his eyes off him, much less try and keep his hands to himself.
‚ÄúSo‚Ä¶ you gonna tell me what‚Äôs wrong, or do I have to guess?‚Äù he asks.
Natasha frowns, her lips pursing as she pats Steve gently on his good shoulder.¬† ‚ÄúWell‚Ä¶ if it‚Äôs any consolation,
‚ÄúAll right, bud, here we are,‚Äù Dad says as he parks the car in the Visitor‚Äôs lot.¬† ‚ÄúThe lady I talked to this morning says we‚Äôre supposed to meet this guy on the third floor of the Athletics building.‚Äù
As soon as the door closed behind him Peter huffed out a puff of air, followed directly by a hard, junky cough that led right into a full-on coughing fit. He shoved his face into his elbow, swallowing against the awful tickle in his throat as he tried to take deep, even breaths. He really didn't feel like triggering any of his monitors at the moment.
Steve's long fingers tangled into Tony's hair, pressing against his scalp. "So‚Ä¶ what? Is there supposed to be a question here?"
the monster thought-screamed as it advanced another couple of steps, so close that Peter could feel its heat hitting him in waves, clouding his vision and searing his lungs as he gasped for breath.
After making himself and Peter some quick scrambled eggs and toast, Steve poured a large mug of steaming hot water over one of his regular herbal tea bags, stirring in a teaspoon of honey.
‚ÄúIt would just be the bookstore.¬† I promise,‚Äù he added once he‚Äôd swallowed another bite of his pizza.¬† ‚ÄúThe security guys didn't seem to have any problem with it today.‚Äù
‚ÄúOh, you can count on it,‚Äù Fury said, smirking as he gave them all a mock salute.¬† ‚ÄúTake care.‚Äù
Or at least, as peacefully as he could with the massive oxygen mask that covered most of his face. Peter wasn't quite to the point where he needed the extra boost during the daytime hours yet, but Tony knew it would only be a matter of time before he got there, and then‚Äî
"Yeah, it definitely looks that way since the autopilot just kicked off," agreed Dad as he hurried towards the steering assembly. "And I don't think this big rig has a self-park function either. Pete, get up here."
And then before Steve could react, there was a flash of bright red light and suddenly Peter was there, dressed in all black and looking down at him with such malice in his big brown eyes that Steve's heart literally skipped a beat.
Peter gave a nod. "Uh huh. Can you tell him I hope he's feeling better?"
Peter nodded, creeping impossibly closer to the edge of the incline he was crouched on.
"Because we weren't a threat to him," said the antennae lady, who seemed to have finally decided that she was done jumping around like a freaking kid on a trampoline.
üî• = this was so hot/ sweet!
"I'm not afraid to have‚Ä¶ all of this," he murmured. He looked over at the portrait of their family that hung on the wall over the bed, one that Papa had painted from a drawing that he'd given Dad right before the Phoenix mission. "I guess‚Ä¶ I'm just afraid that now that I've got it‚Ä¶ I'm just gonna end up fucking it all up again."
The light had barely faded when Steve blinked and suddenly Tony and Peter were there, standing in his cell, with Tony wearing his armour and Peter dressed in his Spider-Man suit. Steve gasped, clutching his side as he got to his feet, trying to ignore the searing pain in his ribs and crushed foot as he held out his arms towards his beloved husband and son.
Peter glanced up at Tony, who gave him a nod. "Go have fun with your new friend, Pete."
Not to mention far,
Tony gulped. "If it works, then yes," he whispered. "Meridia has the same energy problems that we do, so‚Ä¶ if that was fixed, there'd really be no more reason to fight."
Because for how extensive HYDRA was, there was simply no way it could go on indefinitely, especially after the Avengers had managed to thwart Project Insight. And surely all of the political opposition would decide to back down once they were able to completely destroy the evil organisation.
"Hey, buddy," he said, sounding as exhausted as he looked. "How's my boy?"
üò£ = the angst is killing me!
"No, please don't," he whispered. He breathed in, pressing his lips to Tony's hand again as tears stung his eyes. "Just let me appreciate you."
"All right, then as soon as all the diagnostics on Rhodey's suit are done, get started on the drones, yeah?"
Steve huffed, his upper body shaking as he tried to hold back his sobs. He pressed a kiss to the top of Peter's head, then rested his cheek there, squeezing Peter so tightly that he let out a soft grunt. "This time, maybe," he whispered between clenched teeth. "But‚Äîbut what about‚Äîwhat about the
Until now.
Based on his experience, though, Steve had a strong feeling that moving on from this particular battle was going to be different.
"So, can you tell me what happened to Uncle Thor?" Peter asked once they were settled in the kitchen, kneading homemade pizza dough. "I've never seen him this twitchy before."
"Contemplate-y?" Dad said, smirking as he sat back down, assuming his elbows-on-knees position. "Is that even a word?"
With a choked gasp Steve shifted slightly, trying to manoeuvre just enough to get his hand underneath him so he could push his upper body up off of the freezing cold concrete floor.
But on a night like this, when he could take his time and make sure that Tony was completely relaxed and ready for him, it was heavenly.
The nanites were doing their job beautifully.
"Hello, Miss Stacy," he said, as politely as he could.
For himself and Tony, there was no question. They both would do whatever it took to bring their son back, including sacrificing themselves if it came to it. But to ask their teammates, their family to do the same, it was‚Ä¶
"Sam, keep going!" Steve said. "Get all the words done before the sceptre shows up!"
"Well, then how 'bout you just start at the beginning, yeah?" Tony prompted, as if he'd completely read Steve's mind.
A light pink flush crept up Steve's neck to his cheeks. "Well‚Ä¶ I just thought about all the things that I never got to do with my own papa, and‚Ä¶" His flush grew even deeper, his sheepish,
‚ÄúYes, Mr Stark,‚Äù said Pepper.¬† ‚ÄúNow, unless there‚Äôs something else that you need to discuss before you meet with Mr Stane, I‚Äôll be in my office.‚Äù
Papa and Dad both looked at each other, quirking their eyebrows in their silly silent communication thingy that both intrigued and annoyed Peter.
"Uhh," Peter gasped as a blast of ice-cold dread hit him square in the chest. "I don't‚ÄîI don't‚Äî"
‚ÄúMmm,‚Äù Tony murmurs as his eyelids flutter closed.¬† ‚ÄúYou know, my kid thinks you're the bee's knees.‚Äù
"Yeah, yeah, I'll be fine," said Tony. "Thanks."
"Tony," he said, gritting his teeth as one of the nurses finally peeled the destroyed glove from his right hand. "Tony, please, don't let Peter see me like this. I can't‚ÄîI don't want him to see me like this."
Chomping down hard on his bottom lip, Tony turned back to the screen.¬† ‚ÄúOkay, J, how ‚Äòbout we just go on the assumption that the entire STRIKE team is HYDRA, yeah?¬† Unless you‚Äôve got any evidence that might say otherwise?‚Äù
"Sam said that they're doing everything Tony can think of to try and conserve Steve's oxygen," said Uncle Bucky. "The main thing they're worried about at the moment is that he's gonna get too cold, so‚Äî"
Like many fine New York City dining establishments, their restaurant was located on the very top floor of an exclusive hotel. Tony thought it was a bit odd when he happened to notice a man dressed in a poorly-fitting suit standing inside the restaurant's waiting area as they left, but didn't think anything else of it until the elevator doors opened into the parking garage level and three other men stepped out of a nondescript black sedan, one of whom Tony recognised as FBI Agent Bartlett, his father's old acquaintance.
He supposed he shouldn't have been as surprised as he was, given who his dads were. But in the two weeks since he woke up from his coma‚Äî
He couldn't help but wonder if Gwen being out with her dad meant that she'd heard back from Oxford about her internship. Despite Peter's misgivings about her going, he had helped her prepare for her interview, and she had told him afterwards that she'd thought it had gone well.
And this time, it would probably kill him.
Tony rolled his eyes, pulling off his glasses as more tears tracked down his cheeks.
Gwen smiled, her pale cheeks flushing a light pink. "Well‚Ä¶ even if I do, there's still the whole logistics of me moving to England for three months, which Mom and Dad aren't too sure about."
And by far the worst of them, Tony attacking Steve in a rage because he believed that he had been turned into a HYDRA agent, all while wearing armour designed by Justin Hammer.
"Well, Papa's a pretty smart guy, you know," Dad muttered. He dropped his chin to his chest, shaking his head. "Look, buddy, I'm sorry. I don't mean to get short with you, I'm just‚Äî"
, Tony. So scared to lose what I've found, and then when I almost did‚ÄîI couldn't take it, sweetheart, I couldn't! I'm not‚ÄîI'm just not strong enough!"
"JARVIS!" Tony gasped, trying to open his stinging eyes to decipher the readings on his datapad, which were fluctuating all over the place. "JARVIS, what the hell‚Äî?"
Redesigning the whole thing to function as a continuous source of clean energy instead of a defence system had been Peter's idea, as had expanding it to encompass the entire planet rather than only Langaran airspace. Somehow Peter was convinced that once the military leaders saw that there could truly be an end to the war that had ravaged their planet for decades, they would have no choice but to accept it.
"Ahh, was that supposed to be a compliment?" Ned asked, staring at the door to the gym as it swung closed again. "'Cause‚Äî?"
came to claim him.
Ned was right; she was in fact
Not when the race will be over in about fifteen seconds.
And that, that was pretty bold.¬† Even for Obie.
"And you know Bucky's not gonna let anything happen to Peter, Steve," said Sam. "And with the police station just across the street it'd be pretty idiotic to try anything anyway."
"Yeah, that would be a valid assumption," answered Tony. "A software upgrade instead of hardware."
The fact that he didn't have to worry about not being able to see Gwen much over the summer was pretty awesome too. Since she had been offered the summer internship position at Stark Industries, Peter was planning on meeting her in the SI cafeteria every day for lunch during the weeks when they weren't up at the Compound, and they had already planned a movie date for the following weekend, accompanied by Uncle Clint and Auntie Nat.
"I would trust these agents with my life, Mr Stark," Stacy interrupted. "No, I'd trust them with my daughter's life. They are ready and willing to help, all we only have to give the word. I swear it."
And Tony, as far as Steve knows, hasn‚Äôt slept a single wink.¬† Steve thinks he might‚Äôve heard him muttering to himself during one of his more semi-coherent periods, but he can‚Äôt trust himself to be sure.
"I'm sorry, little guy, but I'm going to have to get going now," he said. "Is it all right if I come back in a couple of days?"
"I'm sorry," he said softly. "I‚ÄîI didn't mean it like that."
stressed.
"Oh, and please allow me to introduce my new friend here," Thor said, indicating the walking tree. "This is Tree."
He had repeated the mantra three more times when a bright light flashed outside the window of his cell, followed by heavy footsteps in the hallway. They must've been waiting for him to regain consciousness.
For all of his talk about wanting to take things slow with Tony, he now knew without a doubt that it was going to be a lot harder than he'd originally thought.
"Long as you've got all your homework done," said Dad.
And nothing anyone says is ever going to change that.
"Just‚Ä¶ feeling pretty lucky, on this New Year's Eve," Tony murmured. "And hoping it's not just a passing fancy."
"He's wearing his suit, Steve," Tony murmured as Bruce started the truck, driving carefully over the damp grass. "He's wearing his suit and nothing else. JARVIS couldn't find any of his other clothes in the water, which means he must've left 'em somewhere else, which means‚Äî"
How can anyone even
‚ÄúUh huh.‚Äù¬† Peter tapped his heels together, his pencil flipping around his thumb at lightning speed as he waited.
Tony's gasp lodged in his throat as he made the turn, breathing in deeply through his nose as he tried to calm himself. For how inexperienced Steve might've been when they first got together, in the months since he had already more than made up for it, quite literally blowing Tony's mind with his passion and attentiveness. Tony had always thought of himself as a generous lover, but Steve was on a whole other level. He not only told Tony that he loved him every single chance that he got, he also
you‚Äî!"
He was cut off by Tony's lips, his tongue slipping into Steve's mouth as Steve's hands splayed across Tony's ass, groaning in appreciation as he dug his fingers into the round, firm flesh.
‚ÄúAren‚Äôt they one in the same?‚Äù Steve asks.
Well, ever
‚ÄúTony,‚Äù he said, almost a whisper.¬† ‚ÄúWhat we do keeps the world from falling into chaos.¬† You know that, right?‚Äù
"He wouldn't know, sister," said Nebula. "He doesn't have any feelings."
‚ÄúYeah, but it‚Äôs
While they had literally just finalised a plan to save the universe, if Steve hadn't known any better, he would've thought that the team was celebrating something for how lively they were over dinner. Cracking jokes, trading stories about favourite movies and books and sports teams, and then dragging each other over said favourites, it seemed like the team, although incomplete, had finally found its rhythm again. That they had finally gelled back together as a family, rather than just a group of superheroes who happened to work well together.
"They were there from lunchtime until about an hour ago," Steve said. "Peter was asleep when I called, but Ma said he was doing fine otherwise. Sharon's going to stop there on her way home from the hospital too, just to check on him."
"Soon, bud, okay?" Dad said softly. "Not too much longer."
I can‚Äôt believe we‚Äôve reached the final chapter!  I can‚Äôt thank you all enough for coming along on this ride with me, and sharing all of your wonderful and encouraging comments!  üíñ
it, craving their company, and didn't know how to tell them.
"I'm afraid he won't be able to leave here again, Mr Stark. Not until he's able to have his operation," the lead doctor somberly told Tony once Peter was finally stabilised.
‚ÄúShh, honey, it‚Äôs okay,‚Äù Tony said as he began unbuttoning Steve‚Äôs uniform jacket, tossing it onto the far corner of the couch.¬† Steve had explained to Tony earlier that week that whenever he was feeling especially ‚Äújittery‚Äù, for lack of a better word, any tight clothing he was wearing only made it worse.¬† It was the same reason why he liked to sleep in the nude, or in very loose-fitting shorts or pants, and why he rarely wore underwear.
"Yes, he did," Green Lady said, rolling her eyes. "You got jealous just because I touched his arm."
Peter thought as he tucked even closer to his father, finally succumbing to his exhaustion.
"So you seriously can't tell us anything more about what happened?" Ned asked Peter through a mouthful of hamburger. "I mean, if it was big enough to take down most of the government then you have to know
Several heartbeats passed before Dad answered. "You're damn right, buddy. We don't lose. And I'm not ready to start now."
"Yeah, I don't see how it could be anyone else," agreed Tony. He scrubbed his palm down his face, slumping back into his pillows. "Which probably means that I'm gonna have to put a halt on the damn convoys until I can re-vet all the personnel, which means‚Äî"
"Yes, I am," answered Peter. "I know my papa, and I know that he doesn't think of himself as above the law. Not in any country. The Avengers aren't vigilantes, they're just‚Ä¶ extra equipped to take on certain threats. And by doing that, they help keep everyone else safer. Just like the police force."
Besides that, Tony could probably guess what she would say anyway, so there was no point in wasting her time.
"His name is Doctor Stephen Strange," Steve said, glancing at Sam. His free hand curled into a fist, his jaw twitching as he tried to keep his temper in check. "This is the brain surgeon who refused to come and see Peter when he was sick down in Miami!"
‚ÄúIs that okay?‚Äù Steve breathed as he kissed his way up Tony‚Äôs jaw, pausing before he got to his mouth.¬† ‚ÄúI‚ÄîI know it‚Äôs late, but I was thinking‚Ä¶ if you're not too tired, that I‚Äôd‚ÄîI‚Äôd like to‚Äî‚Äù
"Uh huh," said Peter. He'd always enjoyed any sort of game. "Thanks."
"Oh yeah, like it's not gonna work," Dad said, giving Peter a darn good rendition of his
As had his armoured suit collection. And while Steve could understand Tony making upgrades to his Iron Man armour as he became more familiar with how it worked and what he might need during a mission, this was different. Tony had explained to Steve that he'd flown that missile through the portal in order to save him, and that in his mind it hadn't even been a choice. But now that Tony had gotten a bird's-eye view of what the Avengers‚Äîtheir newly-minted team of superheroes‚Äîcould potentially be facing, he felt he needed to do more to protect the people he loved.
üò≠ = I got you right in the feels
"No, not yet. I'll give him another call in the morning, see what's up."
"Steve!" Sam said as Tony wheeled Steve in, feeling more foolish than he had in years with his four useless limbs and dark wraparound glasses. "You're gonna be okay?"
"I see," said T'Challa. "Well, you are all welcome here. It is my hope that you will enjoy our hospitality as we work together to solve this particularly difficult puzzle." He turned to the woman standing at his right hand. "My general, Okoye, will show you to your rooms. Please, take some rest from your journey. We will have plenty of time to begin discussions later."
"Here here!" called Rocket from his spot next to Thor. "Lemme at 'em! Oh, and good speech, by the way. Very inspiring."
"He shouldn't have to see it," Steve said bitterly. "I should be able to‚Äî"
He reread the sentence again, trying to jog his memory, letting out a loud groan as the thought parked itself on the tip of his brain and refused to budge. He raked a frustrated hand through his hair as he read it for a third time, slowly.
Close enough.
‚ÄúMmm.¬† Okay,‚Äù Tony said warily.¬† As soon as they entered the rather noisy pub, he leaned closer, whispering, ‚ÄúSeriously, hon.¬† If you're not feeling up to this tonight, we can always‚Äî‚Äù
Peter huffed out a sharp breath, followed by a wet, junky cough that made Tony shiver, like someone had just dropped ice down his back.
Better for the Stark name to be spoken with awe and praise, rather than spat out like a curse.
"Well, shit, Tony," Clint said, all joking aside. "Yeah, Cap, we'll‚Äîwe'll be fine. Long as you're sure you won't need all of us. I mean, have they caught any of the guys that set off the explosion yet?"
"Then‚Ä¶ what?"
Steve's mind was swirling so fast that he felt lightheaded, the knot in his throat so big that he could barely swallow. This had to be just another HYDRA trick, because there was no way that his Tony would ever speak to him like that, with such contempt and hatred. Tony loved him.
"I wasn't aware that it was break time," the wizard said, his maroon cloak hanging off his shoulders.
They remained in the tub for almost three hours, with Bruce slowly increasing the water's temperature until both Peter and Steve managed to stop shivering. The whole time the four of them barely moved, with Peter clinging to his Auntie Nat like a baby koala and eventually falling asleep once his hands were wrapped, while Tony held onto Steve, who seemed to be absolutely shell-shocked, his body as rigid as an iron rod and his fingernails digging into the skin of Tony's neck and shoulders. Tony trailed his fingers through Steve's hair and murmured soothing words, his heart thudding against his ribcage as he exchanged occasional furtive glances with Natasha, who looked just as frightened and angry as he was.
"Exactly how many unfulfilled contracts did you leave behind in the wake of your rather abrupt decision to halt your company's weapons manufacturing?" asked Davis.
He tried to look away as Tony flexed his hand, flinching and hissing in pain when Tony gently tugged on the middle finger. It had been hurting for about the last thirty minutes, which probably meant that‚Äî
‚ÄúNo, little guy, I guess you're right,‚Äù Steve said.¬† He checked the clock, relieved when he saw there were only three more minutes till closing.¬† ‚ÄúWhat do you say we get started on getting out of here?‚Äù
"Oh, well, that's true," Ned said, giving Peter a rather sheepish nod. "I guess being the son of two superheroes can be pretty rough sometimes, huh?"
as he chewed and trying to not let it touch his tongue too much.
Steve's mouth was dry, his heart thudding madly against his ribcage as he watched the Senate vote unfold on their bedroom television screen. Next to him sat Tony, his calloused fingers wrapped around Steve's bare bicep, still a bit bleary-eyed from being woken up by JARVIS when the vote was announced. Steve had tried to insist on watching the vote in the living room so Tony could sleep, only to be met by one of Peter's
(See the end of the chapter for
"Yeah, that makes sense." During his ten years of flying, Steve had come to realise that there were two distinct types of fighter pilots: the ones who flew mainly on instinct, and the ones who were constantly thinking a thousand steps ahead. Bucky fell into the former category, with his instinctive flying style evident even in the way that he played chess, while Sam was definitely the latter, often spending hours studying aerial footage of old dogfights while he was auditioning for the test-pilot program.
"Honey, Bruce is right," Tony said, gently but firmly. "And really, even if the thing malfunctions somehow, the chances of getting so-called lost in there are minimal. I've programmed the GPS with the same frequency as the nanites in the suits, so if someone misses a check-in, all you'd have to do is search out that frequency and you'd be able to find 'em."
Once again Steve's mind began to swirl like a cyclone, wondering why in the
"All right, J, looks like we're good to go," he said as he trailed his finger along the outline of Steve's dog tags through his shirt. At Steve's request, or more like down-on-his-knees begging, Tony had stopped wearing his nanite case on his chest while inside the house, resorting instead to carrying it around in his pocket. He supposed that wearing it to bed had maybe‚Äî
. Let's leave Steve with his deep thoughts, all right?"
Thor gave a somber nod. "Very well, Captain."
Tony shrieked. "Are you telling me there's another one here?"
"I have!" Bucky said, speaking up for the first time since they all sat down. He smiled in Sam's direction, obviously very proud of himself. "I understood that reference."
"Well, once Pete gets better I'm sure he wouldn't mind helping her out," said Tony. "Long as she doesn't mind."
‚ÄúYeah, yeah, Cap, I know,‚Äù Tony says.¬† He attempts a smile, one that comes out looking more like a grimace as he takes hold of the shield with one hand, placing his other on Steve‚Äôs hip.¬† ‚ÄúHere.¬† On the count of three, yeah?¬† Three‚Ä¶ two‚Ä¶ one‚Ä¶ go!‚Äù
But that was okay.¬† At the moment, Tony was content to just hold his man close.¬† Steve would let him know when he was ready for sex again.
"Well‚Ä¶ I might've managed to figure it out because I realised I was falling in love with you," Steve said, rushing his words. He took another tentative step forward, his expression so earnest and pleading that Tony's heart lurched. "I asked Colonel Phillips to try and make sure that you were able to leave in time to visit with Peter, and when I saw how much happier you both were because of it, I just‚Äîit made me really happy."
Again, Uncle Bucky shook his head. "There's no way that it could."
"Yeah, but by helping us she'd be risking arrest," Tony pointed out. "You think she'd be willing to do that?"
"Nope," Tony stated. "Not till I get you into a nanotech suit."
Opening the doors, Peter found Papa leaning against the cab of his truck in his usual spot in the parking lot, talking with Chief Stacy, Gwen's father, who was standing outside of his unmarked police car. As soon as Gwen saw them she tugged on Peter's arm, reaching to plant a quick kiss on his cheek.
"Okay, and part of that preparation includes the very best uniforms and equipment that I can come up with," said Tony. "And for you, me, and Pete, that includes nanotech uniforms."
"What, don't tell me you don't recognise me,
"At the moment, not too much," Fury said with a shrug. "However, if something were to happen‚Äî"
"And Phillips never mentioned that Howard was involved?" he asked.
"Mmm," Dad muttered. "Why do I feel like this won't be the first time you two will gang up on me?"
"Shh, honey," Tony whispered, his brown eyes filling with the guilt and self-loathing that made Steve's heart lurch. "I'm sorry. I just‚Äî"
"As long as Iron Man here can acknowledge that under no circumstance can we bring the Time Stone to Thanos," Strange said in a low voice.
"That's the HYDRA bunker in Siberia where we found the Winter Soldier stasis pods! Sam, keep going, Bucky knew this might happen!"
And the team desperately needed to find it.
idea how to handle this information.
"Yeah, I think I'm gonna get going too, Steve," said Sam, nudging him in the arm. "I got some stuff to go over before we start that fancy new class tomorrow."
And then, on Tony's seventeenth birthday, the legal age of adulthood in Langara, Mr Jarvis had presented Tony with a gift, the timepiece that he still wore, and from then on referred to him as
"We have sworn an oath to protect the Time Stone with our lives," added Wong.
Which means‚Äî
Just because he'd stuffed himself with food didn't mean that he wasn't still hungry.
‚ÄúCopy that, Mother Hen,‚Äù Tony quips as he flies up over the roof, hovering in place.¬† ‚ÄúHustle it up then, will ya?¬† I‚Äôm itching to finish this.‚Äù
"Well, then you better tire me out tonight, mo gr√°," Steve said, so low and husky that a bolt of pure heat shot down Tony's spine. "Don't you think?"
"Steve?" Tony said, tugging on Steve's hand when he didn't answer. "I may be a lot of things, but I'm not exactly telepathic. Or at least not yet."
"Yes, sir?"
"Yeah, yeah, J, it's in the same place it's always been," Tony answered. "Tell him to make himself at home, but no shooting any lightning bolts indoors, all right? I'm definitely not in the mood for any holes in the ceilings. Not to mention last time he blew out at least three fuse boxes."
The general eyed Steve up and down, finally nodding once as she resumed her guard position. "Very well."
‚ÄúYou busted the damn hell outta it!‚Äù Tony shrieks, and Steve groans as another shockwave of pain ripples down his stinging, throbbing leg.¬† ‚ÄúI mean,
Getting to his feet, Steve grabbed his worn brown leather jacket and slung it over his shoulder, checking his timepiece on his way out of the pub. It was only 1600, and since he'd already completed his aircraft double-check and filed his mission report for the day, that meant he had plenty of time to make one of his hospital visits before he returned to the barracks for dinner.
"Yes, sir?" he asked.
"The other guy?" Steve asked, completely flabbergasted. "You mean, Hulk? But‚Äîbut‚Ä¶
Grunting, Peter grabbed onto the back of the couch and pulled himself up, peeking over the top to find Papa and Dad on the pullout bed in the very back of the jet. Papa had a book in one hand, some dog-eared novel from the small library he kept in the jet, and Dad's tablet was lying face down off to the side, with his glasses neatly folded on top. Peter couldn't help but smile at how they were cuddled up together, with Dad's head resting on Papa's chest and Papa's arm tight around him.
"No one in particular," Gwen said quickly. "I've just heard people talking about how you missed like a bunch of school last year because your dads had to send you to a safehouse somewhere while they were on a mission."
"Well,
, Tony thought.
"Daddy, I can't‚Äîwe can't‚Äîthey've‚Äîit's just‚Äîwe'll never be able to‚Äîand it's all my fault!"
The next chapter will post on Monday, December 7th.  Thank you for reading!  üíñ
"Ahh, maybe tell us your last name, sir?" asked Peter. "Otherwise it's gonna get pretty confusing here with both of us having the same name."
Steve huffed in frustration. He could remember the exact location of the Soul Stone like he'd seen it just yesterday, but he knew he couldn't admit it. His knowledge would no doubt lead to questions that he couldn't answer out of risk of distracting the team, and while he wasn't completely positive, he had to assume that Thanos wasn't yet aware of its location either, and the last thing he wanted was to give it away.
"I promise."
"All right, then once you've done that you can propose the first part of the plan and see what he says. And if he thinks it's a good enough idea then you can try the next part. And so on, and so on‚Äî"
Peter jumped as his image counterpart let out another brief scream, his breaths coming in stuttered gasps as he stared up at Stane.
"And then this goes here, and that goes there, and then this thing should fit there, and‚Ä¶ yeah. That just might work."
"Holy
"He said something about going to Nidavellir to get a new hammer," Blaster Peter said as he finally released his hold on Peter's neck. Dad immediately lurched forward, drawing Peter into a tight hug as his eyes shot bullets at Blaster Peter.
Not to mention the fact that he'd have to be a complete idiot to try and hurt Peter, knowing that he would immediately bring down the full wrath of the entire Avengers' team upon him.
‚ÄúYeah, yeah, I know!‚Äù Peter tosses back at him over his shoulder.¬† He‚Äôs neck-deep in one of his dresser drawers, frantically searching for the goggles he knows are supposed to be in there.
And now yet another had joined those ranks, the cold, empty chair at their table a sharp reminder at just how fleeting life could be.
"I know that!" Peter yelped. He shot to his feet, fighting the urge to stomp as he started to pace around Gwen's tiny bedroom. "But then my papa goes to Africa and gets attacked by one of the very same assholes who just spent an entire month torturing him, and as he's attacking him, he starts taunting him by saying that I'm just some scrawny kid who's afraid of my own shadow. But I'm
"I understand. And the same with the Decathlon trip?"
"Unfortunately, no. Director Fury stated that the final perpetrator took his own life to avoid capture."
"Okay, but why would there be an alternative budget proposal without having an actual budget proposal first?" Peter mumbled as he opened the file, scanning through hundreds of pages of boring numbers and charts and graphs, until the word 'Superhero' suddenly caught his eye about three-fourths of the way through.
Steve laughs.¬† ‚ÄúYeah, I‚Äôm sure you are.¬† And you might be sore tomorrow too, but that‚Äôs completely normal, okay?¬† Just try and make sure that you‚Äôre getting enough sleep, and soon enough your body will adjust to the new activity and you won't even notice it anymore.‚Äù
He doesn‚Äôt even care about what kind of time he gets.¬† He just needs to win.
"No!" he said, loud and so clear that Steve's arms pebbled with goosebumps. "You can't have me!"
"I'm pretty sure Phillips hasn't been excited about much of anything in almost thirty years," said Tony. "But yeah, I get your point." He pulled back, ruffling Peter's curly hair. "You told me over the phone that you named the channeling program, yeah?"
"Do you happen to know where I can find Thanos?" Thor asked, grunting with another swing of his axe. "I would like to have an impolite conversation with him."
And Steve had been so distraught when he'd realised that he had lost his ring that Tony had made him a new one as soon as he was able to come home, sliding it onto Steve's finger just like he'd placed his original ring during their wedding ceremony.
and I'm so, so sorry. I was‚ÄîI was just scared. So scared to mess things up with you, and I guess‚Äî"
"Sure," he said. "Now if you'll excuse me, I've got a lot of work to do."
"I think three chaperones for a hockey game date are enough, buddy," said Tony. "If things go well you can invite Ned another time."
"Cap!" Sam suddenly said over the comm. "I'm ten seconds out, what's the play?"
"No!" he yelped as he twisted around again, this time seeing Uncle Clint attacking people in what could only be called a murderous rage, no doubt mad with grief over losing Auntie Nat.
‚ÄúAt long last is lasting a little long, boys,‚Äù Natasha pipes up over the sound of a smattering of machine gunshots.¬† ‚ÄúSo what do ya say we speed things up a bit, huh?‚Äù
Steve was
"Awesome." Peter raised his right arm, aiming for the small, outcropped section of their training dome about ten metres up from the ground that Tony had dubbed the Spiders Nest, which was absolutely
"Ah, yeah, I was just coming in to peek at you," Tony murmured as he smoothed Steve's bangs from his forehead, his heart fluttering at the sheer amount of gorgeousness emanating from him, even in his barely-awake, disheveled state.
"Tony, please, just listen, okay?" Bruce said. "We don't have that much time!"
‚ÄúYou told me you were never gonna mention that ever again,‚Äù Tony said, low and tight.¬† ‚ÄúYou even
"Yeah, like she even had a choice," Tony said with a rather cheeky smirk. "I mean, you didn't, did ya?"
"Well, then it'll be fine," said Peter. He inhaled a shaky breath, rubbing his freezing nose on Dad's chest. "We're the Avengers, right? So that means we don't lose."
The only scientist aside from Howard and Anthony Stark who seemed to still be alive was Hank Pym, and yet unlike the others there was absolutely nothing about him listed in the database aside from the fact that he had once worked for the Air Corps. In fact, his name wasn't even clickable.
He‚Äôd have to give himself some extra time for sketching tomorrow evening.
"There, see?" Steve said. He cupped Tony's face, pressing a slow kiss to his forehead. "Peter's fine, sweetheart. It was just a dream."
"Had my husband killed?" Grandma cut in. "Or was at least happy about it? Yes, I do. Although it took me a long time to admit it. I was‚Ä¶ too angry, at first, and all I wanted was someone to blame."
They had also talked a bit about what they might see in Peter's memory. While Steve knew that Peter didn't remember all that much from the Miami bunker battle‚Äîwhich was fine with him since he had enough horrible memories for all three of them‚Äîthis experiment was most likely going to cause a big resurgence of traumatic images, and not only for Peter, since both he and Tony were almost certain that Obadiah was going to show up at some point.
"Dad?" Peter said, causing Tony's belly to flip as he swung across the vast plain, his web latched onto one of the whales' front right fins. "Dad, who's that giant dude? He kinda reminds me of that Gulliver guy from that one book."
"Mmm," grumbled Tony as he stifled another yawn. "Well, as long as you didn't fight the war while I was out, I s'pose it's okay."
"Yep," answered Tony after another mouthful of pasta. "He says 'hi', by the way."
Peter gulped as he opened his laptop, ducking down behind it. "Yeah, well, Papa tries to keep us all pretty healthy, so‚Ä¶"
He cut off when Steve whimpered again, jerking as he curled his tall, broad body even tighter.
Tony gave an exaggerated sigh. "Then what do you suggest,
he thought firmly.
"All right." Tony wasn't sure how much more discussion he could take at the moment, but if it helped Steve to sleep better so he could be more alert for his patrol in the morning, he would do it.
tall, strong Steve‚Äîin such rough shape.
"Yeah, so then by my calculations, these nanites will form into whatever kind of suit they're programmed to form. Which means if I program them to form a Captain America suit, then‚Äî"
"Tony Stark," Dad said shortly. "Look, did Thor happen to say when he might be done with this new hammer of his? 'Cause we could sure use his help."
"Maybe not, but they would at least be a start," Stacy insisted. "And I also have plenty of police colleagues down in D.C. who would be more than happy to start making some arrests if we could gather enough evidence to justify them." He stepped forward, offering Tony his hand. "We want to help you, Mr Stark, you just have to let us."
"Yes, sir," answered JARVIS. "Since the actual mission will be much longer than the trial, Master Peter has implemented several new protocols to ensure that the new go/no-go points will be accurate based on atmospheric conditions and other such parameters."
As long as that went okay, Steve was then going to get down on one knee and ask Tony to be his husband.¬† He‚Äôd had the ring ready for weeks now, one that he had personally designed and commissioned from a jeweller recommended by JARVIS.
‚ÄúYeah, honey,‚Äù he said happily.¬† ‚ÄúI do believe you‚Äôre right.‚Äù
He let the datapad fall onto his lap, his hands dropping to his sides as he slumped back against the pillows, struggling to breathe in.
Sarah smiled, a bright smile that was so like Steve's that Tony nearly did a double-take. "Tony," she said. "It's nice to meet you."
It was almost funny how quickly Tony scrambled to roll onto his stomach, displaying his perfect, round ass right where Steve wanted it. He quickly slid a pillow under Tony's hips before reaching for the bottle of lube he'd stashed in his bedside table, generously slicking up two of his fingers.
"Now the key to a smooth re-entry involves mainly two things," Tony continued. "The first rule of thumb is to not try and re-enter too soon, or prior to your go/no-go, because‚Ä¶ well, Captain Barnes, what'll happen if you attempt to break your orbit too soon?"
Blinking, Peter dragged his eyes away from the clock and settled in on studying Gwen's gorgeous hair draped across her shoulders, and the way the various shades of blonde caught the sunlight streaming in through the classroom windows. She smelled faintly of lavender and jasmine, and that combined with her bright blue sweater that perfectly complimented her striking green eyes, and, well‚Ä¶ it was like Peter felt drunk every single time he looked at her.
Because as he walked past the still-muted television, where President Cole was standing on his stage with his hands held high, basking in the applause from his adoring fans, Steve couldn't help but think of another leader who once stood on stages and basked in the applause of his thousands and eventually millions of followers. A leader who had also preached about nationalism and national pride, and who had promised to end domestic terrorism.
Crawling over to his husband, Steve carefully laid Peter down on the floor next to Tony before pressing his lips to Tony's forehead, his ashen skin already ice-cold.
"You can't do anything," Tony said, completely devoid of emotion. "It's‚Äîit's too‚ÄîBruce and I are the only ones who can figure this out, and once we do, I'm gonna talk to Fury about trying to reopen a diplomatic dialogue with Wakanda, 'cause‚Äî"
"I'll copy that," stated Uncle Bucky. "Let's finish this!"
"I'm trying!" Steve said through clenched teeth. He swiped his hand across his eyes, mentally kicking himself for his lack of concentration.
"Yeah, I know," Tony said against Steve's chest. He glanced at the clock on the wall, noting that it was time to pick Peter up from school and grabbed Steve's hand, interlacing their fingers.
"I can't see why she would," said Steve. He gave Tony a quick but encouraging smile as he reached for the doorbell. "Ready?"
Plopping down onto his chair, Tony took a big gulp of his coffee and pulled out his phone.¬† Even though he never talked to Steve about his work, just getting to hear his voice for a couple of minutes always helped him feel better.
"No, he didn't beat me," said Sam. "He only kicked both my ass and Bucky's in about an hour flat. It was like he could see the whole damn game from just the first move."
"Uhh, Herbert B Swoope," answered Ned.
"Shh, sweetheart," Steve whispered, brushing his fingers across Tony's lips. "Don't worry about it now, okay? Try and get some rest, I know you haven't been sleeping well lately."
Arriving back at the penthouse, Steve checked in on Tony‚Äîwho was thankfully still asleep‚Äîbefore returning to his papers in the kitchen, managing to get the outline of another semi-decent plan worked out before Tony finally wandered in, bleary-eyed and yawning, just like Peter had been a couple hours before.
"No way in hell," Tony muttered with wide eyes. He grabbed onto Steve's biceps, gliding his palms up to his shoulders as Steve pulled him closer, tucking Tony's head under his chin. Tony sighed in contentment at the sound of Steve's low, deep heartbeat beneath his ear, briefly closing his eyes. Back in the beginning of their relationship Tony had been a bit self-conscious about the fact that Steve was so much taller than him, and the way he could just manhandle Tony whenever he felt like it, but now he absolutely loved it. Tony loved being completely enveloped by Steve's arms when they hugged, loved being the smaller spoon when they cuddled at night, and he especially loved it when Steve carried him off to bed, as if he just couldn't wait the few extra seconds for Tony to simply walk there.
Only, it didn't.
"That we've found."
‚ÄúWe have evidence, Obie,‚Äù Tony added before Obie could think of a response.¬† He held up the papers, rifling through them.¬† ‚ÄúOrders, shipping manifests, and decrypted communiques between your friend General West and the bad guys over in Sokovia.¬† It‚Äôs all here.¬† The gig is up.‚Äù
‚ÄúSteve?‚Äù
"I'm here, honey!" Tony finally said. "But‚Ä¶ I'm afraid you're not gonna like where I'm headed."
"Definitely," answered Peter, watching carefully as Papa pinned the pretty purple violet to his lapel. Dad and Papa had asked Grandma to be in charge of organising the flowers for the wedding, and Peter had to admit that she had done a wonderful job. The arrangements of violets, daisies, and lilies that flanked each row of the chairs set up outside by the lake were really pretty, as were the various bouquets that she'd had placed as centrepieces on the round tables set up near the buffet area.
Steve's face fell, and he tugged on Tony's arm. "C'mere, sweetheart," he murmured as he pulled Tony up to his feet, curling his arms around his waist as Tony's wrapped around his neck. Then he buried his nose in Tony's neck, pressing light kisses to his deliciously soft skin that always carried the faint scent of coconut.
And, of course, all the guilt that accompanied them. Guilt he couldn't shake no matter how fast he ran or how many punching bags he destroyed.
Peter shook his head, his mouth full of green beans, which while rather good were nowhere near as good as Papa's. "No, not always, when I was little we lived in a different house a bit further away. The Tower wasn't done being built until I was five. And in the summers we'd always go back to Malibu, until‚Äî"
"Ready? Ready for what?" asked Quill.
"No," Steve said as he jerked away, so softly that he knew there was no chance that James would hear him. There was no way he could look up into the face of his husband's oldest friend, wearing armour that his husband had made for him, all while not knowing if‚Äî
"Aahh," Steve said on a moan, shivering as wave after wave of pain washed over him. His hands and arms felt like they had been encased in ice, so frozen he could no longer even wiggle them. "I‚ÄîI don't‚ÄîI don't‚Äî"
Tony sighed, burrowing further into Steve's side as Thor grew louder and his gesturing grew more and more animated. He supposed it was a good sign that Thor was back to telling stories again, as for a long time he had been just a shell of his former self.
"Oh, no reason, just asking," Ned answered, clearing his throat. "Ah, thanks, Liz, for the invitation! I should be able to come."
After being forced to watch Peter literally get stolen right out from under his nose and then having Steve get literally torn right from his arms, Tony was taking no more chances.
What if once they went back, they then lost someone else during the ensuing battle?
"Yeah, and I got one in the crosshairs," Clint said. He drew back his bow, aiming it towards a shadow to the right of the main entrance and firing. "Bullseye."
Tony shook his head, scrubbing a palm down his face. "No, Toomes was a salvage contractor, not an engineer. And he's been in holding too long to have been involved with this."
"And it did," Steve assured him. "I saw her with my own eyes. Wanda, Sam, Bucky, the Guardians, Dr Strange, and Peter. They were all there."
He had just taken another sip of his coffee when he heard a soft knock on the door.
"And then I can leave here?" Steve asked, not taking his eyes off his husband's face. "I don't‚ÄîI don't wanna‚Äî"
Steve's heart was heavy as he made his way down the hallway, taking a quick moment to peek in on Peter before continuing on to the living room, where he settled in on the comfy loveseat to wait for Sam and Bucky. The nearby clock read 0200, so he tipped his head back and closed his eyes, breathing in a slow, deep breath as he tried to come up with his usual series of mission plans. With a nearly twenty-four hour flight time ahead of him, Steve knew he'd have plenty of time to finalise them, especially if any new information became available while they were en route, but he always liked to have at least a skeleton plan in place before embarking on any mission. Even a so-called diplomatic one.
"He won't be able to stay conscious," Peter whispered. "And then‚Ä¶ even if they do figure out how to get his power back up, he won't‚Äîhe won't be able to‚Äî"
One of the few timeless experiences he'd had since waking up from the ice.
"'It is done'," whispered Natasha.
Coming face-to-face with his best friend, who he thought he‚Äôd lost back in 1944, and having him turn out to be a brainwashed HYDRA assassin was something Steve was still coming to grips with.¬† If it weren't for Tony and Peter, and Tony‚Äôs incredible generosity with helping to not only search for Bucky but also fully funding those search efforts, Steve isn't sure how he would be coping.
, he couldn't see how they could avoid it. Strange had said there were only two ways for them to be victorious, and Tony highly doubted that one of them consisted of them just standing around watching as an endless army poured through a wormhole.
"Hey, nothing wrong with holding a girl's hand at the movies, Barton, long as that's all he's doing," Tony said.
He closed his bruised and swollen eyes as bright flashes of light raced across his mind, sprinkled with various images of his husband and son that were alternatively heart-wrenching and terrifying. Peter lying unconscious, crushed underneath three tons of rubble. Tony being attacked by some electronic whip-wielding lunatic while he was driving. Peter being attacked by the very defence drones that Tony had invented to protect him, while Quentin Beck looked on and laughed.
Dodging various students as they headed down the hallway, Peter tried again to push all of his negative thoughts away. It was already April, for goodness sake, which meant he and Gwen only had about ten weeks before she left for Oxford for the summer, and the last thing he wanted was to spend all of that time moping around like a toddler.
"Hey, Cap," Sam said as the elevator doors slid open. "Fancy meeting you here."
"Likewise, Captain," replied T'Challa. He glanced over at Tony, who instantly straightened his shoulders. Tony had met a few different heads of state during his years as a weapons manufacturer, and while many of the palaces owned by those rulers had been far more extravagant than this one appeared to be, none of the others had had half of the amount of stateliness that Tony was sensing from this particular king.
At that, Steve slowly lifted his head, his cheeks so greyishly ashen and his blue eyes so puffy and bloodshot that tears welled in Tony‚Äôs eyes.¬† ‚ÄúI‚ÄîI can‚Äôt!¬† Tony, I can‚Äôt do it alone!‚Äù he forced out.¬† ‚ÄúI thought that I could, and I tried so hard, but I need‚ÄîI need‚Äî!‚Äù
"I still don't want you doing too much more," Steve cut in. "What Scott told us‚Äî"
‚ÄúEh, you know,‚Äù replied Tony.¬† ‚ÄúJust had a meeting that was a bit tense but‚Ä¶ it‚Äôll be okay.¬† What about you?¬† Your customers keeping you on your toes?‚Äù
"Sir?" Steve asked, frowning. "I'm not sure what you mean?"
‚ÄúYeah, well, welcome to Sokovia,‚Äù Tony says, somewhat warily.¬† ‚ÄúThe icebox that nobody likes but everybody wants.‚Äù
"All right," he said as he kissed Tony's cheek. "I'll be back soon."
Not exactly the definition of the Langaran military dream.
‚ÄúThank you, Colonel.‚Äù¬† Clearing his throat, Tony handed Rhodey the papers and took Steve‚Äôs hand, looking Obie straight in the eye.¬† ‚ÄúMr Obadiah Stane, allow me to introduce Captain Steven Grant Rogers, U.S. Army Special Forces, retired.¬† During his twenty years of impeccable Army service, Captain Rogers graduated from the Army‚Äôs Officer Candidate School with the highest marks in his class, and, due to his outstanding leadership ability and a tactical mind that was second-to-none, he was then given the command of one of only six operating Special Forces units.¬† As you can see, he is the recipient of the Bronze Star medal, which, as you may or may not know, is awarded to members of the United States Armed Forces for either heroic achievement, heroic service, meritorious achievement, or meritorious service in a combat zone.¬† Although, with regards to Captain Rogers, he received his Bronze Star for all four of those exemplary qualifications.‚Äù¬† Tony paused, sucking in a lungful of air as he gauged Obie‚Äôs expression, which had turned a bit stone-like during his comments.
And while some were obviously used, with crease lines along the spines and a few slight dog-ears on the corners, almost two-thirds of the books looked to be brand-new copies of old printings.¬† Novels with their original covers instead of the updated film-adaptation versions, and first editions of popular titles like
As for how many moments there had been since then, well, Tony was certain that he'd lost count a long time ago. And while that realisation was a bit overwhelming‚Äîand even more than a bit, if Tony was honest with himself‚Äîit was also liberating. It was, in a word,
"Because they are," Steve murmured, his hand clenching into a tight fist as realisation dawned.
A loud crash and an immediate muffled, "Ow!" followed Dad's words, and Peter was giggling by the time Uncle Bruce appeared on the screen.
He was more addicted to Steve than he'd ever been to Scotch or gambling or anything else, and that was saying something.
Gwen scoffed as she tilted her head, her hands on her hips. "Oh, and
"Oh God,
For his part, Steve told him a few stories of his childhood as well, leaving out the fact that he'd spent most of it battling the sick lungs that he'd feared would kill him before he was twenty. Project Rebirth was one of the most closely guarded secrets in the Air Corps, and Steve wasn't sure where Tony's security clearance fell or if his father had ever mentioned it to him.
And, because that apparently wasn't enough, both Dad and Papa had also been directly involved with the collection of evidence in preparation for Hank Pym's trial, as well as giving key personal testimony during the court-martial of General O'Brien and his lackeys.
He gave the door a firm knock, then stepped back, tugging on the sleeves of his dress uniform jacket as a corporal opened the door.
Tony scoffed. "Blind luck that it didn't."
"You mind if I ask you something?" he finally said as he sat down to tie his shoes.
But, unlike Tony and Peter, HYDRA was supposed to be dead.¬† Gone.¬† Quashed when Steve defeated the Red Skull only minutes before he crashed his massive plane into the Arctic ice.
"Are you gonna have your new car there at the Tower?" Ned asked excitedly. "Are your dads gonna let you drive yourself to school now?"
"Yes, that's right, Ms‚Ä¶"
"I've already sketched out our ideas for the biggest airliner, Dad," Peter cut in. "Wanna see it?"
"Steve, I don't need you tell me that you appreciate me," Tony said after a short pause. "It's pretty much written all over your face everytime you look at me."
"So, you wanna tell me what that was all about?" Gwen asked as they exited the classroom, right on cue. "I know you might not think that you need to pay attention all the time, but it's not like you to get called out for it in front of the entire class."
Blinking back tears, Steve dug his phone from his back pocket and quickly snapped three pictures, sniffing as he examined them. Six years after their first fateful meeting, he could still remember the very first photograph he'd ever taken of his two precious boys, months before he was even able to call them that.
"It's in that book?" Uncle Bucky asked with wide eyes. "Um‚Ä¶ do I actually wanna know?"
"Yep," said Tony as he, James, and Sam came to hover about twenty metres above the wizards' shields, with Quill and Carol taking up flanking positions. "Waiting on your signal, hon."
"Yeah, it does," agreed Bucky. "Kinda almost makes me wanna take a shot at those goddamn Meridians every once in a while. Let them see what it's like for a change."
An awkward pause followed, punctuated by Dad and Papa turning to look at each other at the exact same time, both of them wearing the same wary expression. "Wow," Dad finally said. "I guess I didn't realise that you two were such good friends already."
"And as I explained to your predecessors, I felt that the Iron Legion was necessary to defend the convoys transporting artefacts from the cleanup sites from possible outside attack. However, I would not personally classify them as weapons."
‚ÄúYeah, bud?‚Äù
A second later Steve came, hard and uncontrolled, shouting and gasping and writhing as Tony slammed home one final time.¬† A hoarse sob tore from his throat as he spilled inside Steve, collapsing on top of him once he was spent.¬† For several moments, Steve could honestly not move, could barely register the warmth of Tony‚Äôs breath and the slight scratch of his goatee as he trailed soft kisses all over Steve's chest and neck.
The team had been able to rule out most of Western Europe thanks to both Fury's connections and Pepper's popularity as the Stark Industries chief executive officer, leaving Africa, Antarctica, and the coastal regions of the mainland U.S. left to search. Fury had already started working with his connections in Africa, and while Tony wouldn't put it past HYDRA to have a base in Antarctica, there were far too many other bases and outposts scattered along the coastal areas of the continent to really be able to hide another.
"You did?" Dad asked eagerly. "How's he look?"
"I‚Ä¶ uh‚Ä¶ I should've asked what you liked last night when I stopped by," he said as he spread the contents of the food bag across the centre of the blanket. "But since I didn't think of it I kinda just brought a little of everything, so I hope‚ÄîI hope it's okay."
"Well, of course it's gonna work!" Phillips shot back. "When has anything of yours ever not worked?"
"Gotcha." Squaring his shoulders, Tony looked down at the storage case, tucking his t-shirt into his sleep pants at the last minute. No need to be worrying about bunched-up fabric while testing out a new suit. "All right, here we go."
"Eh, it's okay. You got that stuff I left for you yesterday morning though, right?"
"Happy New Year to you, sir," answered JARVIS. "I do hope that you enjoyed the festivities? This area is quite well-known for its fireworks display."
"Peter's already finished with his essay," Gwen said, smiling at Peter over the top of her water glass. "Course he kinda has an advantage, having a living legend for a father who actually lived through a lot of the stuff that he wrote about."
It took Steve a moment for her words to sink in. "Wait. So you're saying that what's happening here‚Äî"
‚ÄúC‚Äômon, honey, pick up,‚Äù Tony murmured as he tried calling Steve again, dropping his arm to his side in a huff when he didn't answer.¬† Peter‚Äôs repeated concern that they shouldn't have left Steve alone all weekend suddenly flew to the forefront of Tony‚Äôs mind, and he let out a loud gasp as he tried calling him for the third time.
"Yeah, I recognise the name," said Dad. He glanced over at Papa again. "I guess I'm fine with it."
That he was proud to be the son of Tony Stark.
Mr Clean shrugged. "We didn't. After he retrieved the Reality Stone, Thanos simply left us there."
"Copy that," Sam said with a nod. "And good luck."
Carol scowled, shooting Steve a questioning look. "Yeah, I guess so. You okay there, Cap?"
"Me too," said Natasha. "I'm only wondering if we should try to get in touch with Carol first?"
"Dad?" Peter exclaimed, immediately biting down hard on his lip and cursing himself for being so loud. But the sound of his father's repulsors and flight stabilisers was unmistakable, causing goosebumps to pebble down his arms.
"Um‚Ä¶ pretty sure it was Uncle James," Peter said cheekily as he flipped over to Rhodey, landing gracefully onto his back. "Right, Uncle James?"
"Whew," said Peter. "Okay. That sounds good. Oh, and Dad?"
"All we can do now, is wait."
"Yeah, yeah. Thanks for the call, Miss Stacy," said Tony. "Talk to you later."
Then all bets were off.
‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not hacking if I‚Äôm on the goddamn payroll,
Chuckling, Steve rounded the corner into the massive kitchen, immediately stepping back as Natasha emerged from the depths of one of the ovens, a steaming pumpkin pie in her mitted hands.
‚ÄúIt‚Äôs
Thor's face turned grim, his hand gripping his axe handle with white knuckles. "Thanos killed my brother," he said through clenched teeth. "So I am uncertain if Stark and Starkson will be formidable enough to prevent Thanos from obtaining the Time Stone."
when his gaze happened to slip down to the second shelf from the bottom, where he noticed a few boxed sets of the
The harsh beep of one of his monitors broke him from his spiralling thoughts, and Peter rolled his eyes as he slumped backwards, trying to take deep, even breaths as he fought the almost overwhelming urge to cough. His heart was racing, thudding madly against his ribcage, and the last thing that Peter wanted was for Dad and Papa to show up while he was having yet another one of his choking fits.
"Nope, I guess not," Tony said from where he was sprawled out on their bed, wearing only his fluffy bathrobe and looking thoroughly debauched. He let out a groan as he pushed himself up on his elbow, eyeing their closet warily. "S'pose that means I have to get dressed now, huh?"
"Ugh," Peter said, scrunching his nose at the memory of that awful night as he folded the top of his chip bag, licking the orange Dorito dust from his fingers. He had absolutely no desire to ever repeat that incident. Puking his guts out after eating a homemade dessert was not exactly the best way to endear himself to his girlfriend's family.
‚ÄúHoney?¬† You okay?‚Äù
The motion notice also failed to include the fact that as soon as it was discovered that Regina was passing company secrets to Hammer Industries, she was immediately fired and referred for prosecution, along with Justin Hammer.
"Hoo boy, talk about timing!" Clint said over the comm, echoing exactly what Steve was thinking. "I think we might actually have a shot now!"
"You're‚Äîyou're here!"
"Hang on, you tend to fly‚Ä¶
"Please continue, Mr Stark," Steve said.
"No, probably not," Tony said with a wince. He'd heard plenty of rumours about the accident that had taken Bruce Banner's life, and each one was more sensational than the last.
"I know you can't," Natasha said gently. "Which is why George Stacy has offered to come in here and sit with him while we debrief. He and Gwen both." Her lips curled into a soft smile. "Gwen's been asking every few seconds when she can see Peter anyway. I think she's pretty worried about him."
"I'm pretty sure we can both play at this game, sweetheart," Steve said as he claimed Tony's lips. The kiss was hot, wet, and sloppy as he carried Tony over to the couch against the far wall, depositing him down in a tangle of limbs as he ordered JARVIS to lock down the lab.
Not one of his finer moments, Papa had said, his cheeks pink with embarrassment. Thankfully all the cuts he'd received from the glass were healed up by the next day, but Peter knew it still wasn't something that Papa enjoyed thinking about.
Peter gulped, biting his bottom lip. "Well‚Ä¶ no‚Ä¶ but that doesn't mean that I can't still do it. Right?"
‚ÄúSteve.¬† Got it.¬† So why do you think this Steve guy might be sick?‚Äù
"That's right," answered Beck.
"Is that a confession, Captain?" Tony said slyly. "Wow, that was almost too easy."
"I love you, too," he whispered back, first kissing Tony's forehead, then his nose, and finally his mouth. "Husband."
"My King!" exclaimed General Okoye. "We're going to allow those things free access to our lands?"
"Mmm. Love you too."
"Oh," Peter said. "Well, I guess that makes sense since you guys are Norse gods and all. But what's going on? What happened?"
Tony's bottom lip was trembling as he stared at the wall over Steve's shoulder, struggling to form words. The problem with just going back to bed was that Tony was absolutely certain that even if he tried, he would not be able to sleep again, and it wouldn't be fair of him to keep Steve awake with all of his tossing and turning. Steve may have liked to remind Tony that he didn't need as much sleep as a quote,
"Uh huh," Peter said with a sniff. "Just, don't forget to eat, okay? Please?"
"Ahh, yeah," Tony said after a short pause. "Um‚Ä¶ something like that." Finally locating the goggles he was looking for, he exited the ship and began surveying the damage to the engine.
"Oh, shut the hell up, Tomis, will you?" called Joseph. "Maybe if you weren't always yapping when you should be listening, you'd be on O'Brien's good side too."
"I'm trying to say that something is coming‚Äî!" Peter cried, just as a circular metal ball rolled onto the ship, generating a blast that blasted him directly into one of the metal support beams of the ship. Giving his head a quick shake, Peter pushed himself up on his hands, his eyes landing on what appeared to be a woman with a set of antennae poking out of the top of her forehead.
Fresh tears welled in Peter's eyes, spilling down his face. "But Papa's gonna suffocate if they don't get him down soon, and I can't let that happen, Uncle Bucky, I just can't! My dad needs him!"
"Steve," Tony said softly as he led Steve over to the grassy area next to the runway. "You're in shock, honey, but it's okay. You're okay."
"Pull any salvageable audio files from Pete's phone and display," Tony said, tapping the monitor mounted to the inside of the truck.
‚ÄúYes,‚Äù answers Steve.
"Clear your head, right?" Bucky finished. His eyebrows knitted together as he eyed Steve over his bottle of superwater. "You've been trying to do that a lot lately, Stevie, but from what we've seen none of what you're doing actually seems to be doing you any good."
Dad sighed heavily, and Peter pictured him pinching the bridge of his nose, like he always did whenever his coffee ran out before he was done tinkering with whatever he was tinkering with.
look.
"It wasn't arrogance, honey," Tony said. "At the time you had no reason to think that Zola would do what he did, or that anyone besides the goddamn Nazis would be stupid enough to buy into HYDRA's philosophy. Hell, not even Hitler knew exactly what HYDRA was doing."
He didn't dare say that to Tony, though. Things were already precarious enough.
But, he supposed, that was probably beside the point.
"Oh now, now, is that any way to speak to your authority figure, Peter Stark-Rogers?" Hammer said, or rather, sneered. "I would've thought your

And most likely also very, very illegal.
"You're the
Steve thought, glancing briefly at Natasha, who grimaced.
Wanda twisted her hands again, no doubt thinking of her brother.
Steve sat ramrod straight on his stool for several minutes, staring so hard at the door that his eyes were out of focus.¬† He had known that he was perhaps tempting fate a bit too much when he‚Äôd chosen that particular location for his storefront, but in all of his wildest possible imaginations, he had never,
He had already finished half of his tea by the time Tony reached for his hand, his long, calloused fingers warm as they curled around his own.
Ducking his head under Dad's chin, Peter breathed slowly in, trying to let the sound of Dad's heartbeat, barely audible through his armour, work its usual calming magic on him.
"Steve!" Tony cried as his body bowed up like a bowstring, ready to snap. "Honey, now you're just teasing me!"
you stand there and try to deny your involvement in a coup against a duly-elected government!¬† And how
"I understand," Steve said. "And I agree. There's‚Ä¶ there's a couple other things that I need to tell you as well."
"And I don't care about any of that stuff," Peter said. "All I care about is getting my papa back. My dad needs him, especially after‚Äî" He broke off, shaking his head. He'd already cried over himself enough, and more tears wouldn't help anyway. "Especially afterwards. And I know I can bring Papa home, so you just gotta leave me alone until I figure this out."
‚ÄúI‚Äôm sure whatever configuration of launch calculus you come up with will work out just fine, Barton,‚Äù Tony replies.¬† ‚ÄúJust so long as the guards keep dropping.‚Äù
Tony shook his head, throwing up his hand.¬† ‚ÄúYou know we are, ‚Äòcause you asked me the very same question right before I shut the door in your face,‚Äù he said quietly.¬† ‚ÄúNow, I‚Äôm already late picking up my son, so I‚Äôll talk to you more tomorrow.‚Äù
The single best thing to ever happen to Tony deserved nothing but the absolute best in return.¬† And in order to give him that, Tony had to keep doing what he did best.
he thinks as he takes his second breath of the race twenty metres after the turn.¬† He swears he hears Phillips‚Äô low grouchy voice hollering his name just as he turns his face back into the water, but he doesn‚Äôt bother to dwell on it.
"Pete?" Dad suddenly said from his doorway, rapping his knuckles against the wood. "Feel like having a milkshake for dinner?"
Steve was quiet for several heartbeats, trailing his thumb along Tony's knuckles as he tried to come up with something reassuring to say. He didn't want to put so much stock into dreams since they were‚Ä¶ well‚Ä¶
The main problem would be getting his hands on the rest of the materials that he needed. Materials that the government leaders were guarding so closely and so possessively that only a handful of people even knew of their existence.
Of course, Steve had assured him that that wouldn't be a problem.
"Goddamnit, Steve, why the hell can't I figure this out?" Tony cut in. "I've designed countless weapons for this government over the years, including not one, but
"Mmm," Steve mumbled, grimacing as Tony slid his freezing-cold palms across his husband's chest, searching for possible signs of injury. Usually it didn't take Steve this long to figure out that something was wrong, especially since Tony's nightmares tended to be noisy, with a lot of kicking and flailing around. Steve's Army- and serum-sharpened senses never allowed him to miss the fact that something wasn't quite right.
"He did not specify, sir, but I do believe it is safe to assume as such."
all right, he just couldn't discuss it at the moment.
"No, don't be making any promises that you can't keep," Tony warned, stifling a yawn. "But I still hope that you're right."
"Don't you even fucking talk to me!" Tony shouted as he aimed his repulsor again. "I'm warning you, if you take one more step towards my son, I'm gonna‚Äî"
"Well‚Ä¶ yeah," Steve admitted. "Especially with how stressed you were about it."
"He did,
"Something's coming, and we've got‚Äîwe've gotta be careful, 'cause I think something's‚ÄîI think Thanos is gonna‚Äî!"
Second only to the thought that Tony might reject Steve‚Äôs impending marriage proposal.
"Potential biological weapons aren't really either of their areas of expertise, Steve," Natasha said gently. "I'm sure if any of the SHIELD scientists have questions that either of them can answer that they'll be looped in right away."
"Yeah, babe," Tony said, clearing his throat. "Pete, he came in earlier while I was working on the MAUDE glasses interface to tell me that dinner was ready. I let him take a look at it, and he tinkered with the design a bit like he often does, and then he asked me if once I got it figured out, if he could do the experiment along with Bucky. He told me that he felt like a ticking time bomb with those words just floating around down there in his subconscious, and‚Äî" Tony paused, looking into the concerned eyes of his husband, those striking blue eyes with just a hint of Irish green. "I know we've already told him that he's too young to make those kind of decisions, especially since we don't know if this will actually work or not, but Steve‚Ä¶ do we really have the right to tell him that he can't try, just because we're scared of what might happen? Isn't that just really goddamn selfish of us?"
"I love how sensitive you are in certain spots,
"Pete, sometimes things like this just don't work out, and‚Äî"
"Thor?" he said again a few heartbeats later, peeling his eyelids open a fraction of a millimetre at a time. His ears were rumbling with the sound of rushing blood, but he still was able to hear the
But Papa wouldn't agree.
still can."
Peter's eyes narrowed as he thought. This was not anything like what he'd ever learned in school about Langara's recent history.
"JARVIS, also add Mr Scott Lang to the SI payroll as a consultant in cyber security. Monthly salary of‚Ä¶ what, ten thousand should be enough to live on in San Fran, shouldn't it?"
The tiny cot where Steve lay completely naked and curled into a tight ball, just like Tony had found him after their first night together.
That at least got Steve to smile, however fleeting it was. In order to help combat Tony's irrational fear of the dark, he and Steve had started playing music in their room after the lights went out, courtesy of the hand-crank record player that Steve's mother had given him after his acceptance into the Air Corps. Steve had even taught Tony how to dance, a skill that Tony had always wished he'd been able to learn but could never find the time‚Äîor the right partner. Since Tony had moved in it had become a tradition of sorts for the two of them. He and Steve would return from saying goodnight to Peter at the hospital, grab some snacks from the mess hall, and then spend a good twenty or so minutes just slow-dancing together in the middle of the room, the music combined with Steve's closeness working to chase away the demons that Tony had always feared might attack him in the dark.
Peter watched as she stepped inside her house, pausing to wave at him from the window by the door as he stepped down the stairs to join his aunt and uncles.
"I didn't mean it like that," he muttered. "I just‚Äî"
"It's Captain Rogers, Mr Stark," came the response. "I'd‚Ä¶ like to ask you something."
‚ÄúWell‚Ä¶ I‚Äôd have to say that it would be kinda nice if you'd release all the files you‚Äôve got on these HYDRA assholes, so I don't have to waste time digging for ‚Äòem,‚Äù Tony said.¬† ‚ÄúLet me at least come up with a bit of a game plan.‚Äù
Sorry for forcing Dad to have to beg for his life to be spared twice in the span of about twenty minutes, which had to be some kind of a record, as hero gigs go.
"I know, sweetheart," Steve said. "Peter told me that he hasn't been to school in over a year."
And she had only mentioned the boy's father, so did that mean he didn't have a mom? Or that the mom wasn't involved?
"When you're not out in space," Peter said.
they gave it to you, Tony!" Steve snapped. "I know it because that drug almost managed to
Steve leaned back in his chair, draping his arm across Tony's shoulders as his teammates continued their banter. This was what being in the Air Corps was supposed to be like. This was the type of camaraderie that he craved. An entire team of people all willing to do something very difficult and dangerous just because it was the right thing to do.
"Nah," Peter said, giving Tony one of his papa's
"Mr Stark, it's good to see you, sir," he said, shifting the tablet and holding out his hand. Tony attempted a smile as he took it, his eyes sweeping across the well-dressed scientist. With his dark hair and brown eyes Beck didn't look all that much like Killian, but there still seemed to be something about him, some smarminess that made Tony uneasy, and he suddenly found himself wishing that he had agreed to let Pepper sit in on the meeting after all.
"No, it's okay," Steve said. "You and Peter are more alike than either of you realise, and that includes both the good and some of the more frustrating traits." His full lips curled into a smirk, that little half-smile that he reserved only for Tony. "It's endearing most of the time."
The guilt could wait. Right now, they had a battle to win.
Tony scrubbed his palm down his face as he poured himself a fresh cup of coffee.¬† Knowing Obie, he‚Äôd probably forget about the printers by the end of the day, aided by a few double-shots of Scotch and the fact that they weren‚Äôt generating any active revenue.
Glancing down, Steve saw that Tony was right.¬† Peter was curled up into his side, so soundly asleep that his mouth was hanging open.

Tony immediately scoffed, disguising it as a weird sort of cough as he tucked his notes under his arm. Out of all of the thousands of members of the Langaran military there was not a single one of them that Tony felt he could trust farther than he could throw, except for Rhodey.
"I should check Peter's vital signs, Captain," Sharon said as she came up next to Steve. "If you don't mind."
"Tony, I've told you that it's not necessary for you to‚Äî"
"So do I, little guy," Papa said as they arrived inside the Tower garage. He gave Peter's knee another squeeze, his worry wrinkle firmly etched between his eyebrows. "C'mon. If you can get all of your homework done before dinner, I thought we might watch a movie with Uncle Sam and Uncle Bucky afterwards. Maybe it'll help take our mind off of things."
They ended up driving through Uncle Bucky's favourite burger place, the one that had the milkshakes that were so thick you had to eat them with a spoon. Uncle James disappeared into his room for more conference calls as soon as they were done eating, and Peter and Uncle Bucky were just about to start a game of chess when JARVIS announced that Dad and Papa were on the line.
Tony muttered under his breath, thankfully far enough away from his microphone that it wasn't picked up. Steve's cheeks were a bright pink, his full lips pursed tightly in anger.
"No, don't you be 'Tony-ing' me right now," he snapped. "You know damn well that I'd much rather be woken up with a kiss and a soft, 'hey sweetheart, can you help me hop on over to the bathroom?' or something like that as opposed to you smacking your face into the floor 'cause you're too damn stubborn to admit that you need me to help you."
‚ÄúVery good, sir,‚Äù JARVIS said.¬† ‚ÄúHowever, as Ms Williams‚Äô file was encrypted under your order, it will take a few minutes to decrypt.¬† Please stand by.‚Äù
"Oh, you know," Peter said with a shrug, running his tongue across his dry lips. "Ms Sharon was off today, so‚Ä¶ I just try not to bother anyone too much when she's off. It's okay."
(See the end of the chapter for
Steve let out a soft chuckle. "Yeah. I‚Ä¶ uh‚Ä¶ I have pretty good ears." He tucked Tony close, laying them both back down onto the pillows. "Did my alarm clock startle you? I'm sorry if it did."
Dozens of lines of computer code scrolled across his tablet screen not three seconds later, with the initial changes dating back to Beck's third year at the company, when he was first named to the position of Supervisor.
Was Steve even still alive, or had he been blown to dust too? What about Rhodey? Or Nat, or Bruce, or any of the others?
"No, no, I'd love to see the tree in your backyard, little guy," Steve said. He leaned back in his chair, resting his sketchbook on his knee like he always did. "Ready?"
‚ÄúOh, you know.‚Äù¬† There's a pause, followed by footsteps as Natasha approaches his desk, her faded floral tea mug cradled between her hands.¬† ‚ÄúThe train was on time, the bakery got my order right on the first try, and I didn't drop my ID down the storm drain, so‚Ä¶ yeah, I‚Äôd say it‚Äôs going okay so far.‚Äù
"Uh huh." Peter crossed his arms, sticking out his bottom lip in such a perfect pout that Steve almost laughed. "It's too bad you can't meet my dad, I think he'd really like you."
"Uh huh. Sounds good."
"Five‚Ä¶ four‚Ä¶ three‚Ä¶ two‚Ä¶ one‚Ä¶ Captain Rogers is passing through the barrier, sir," said JARVIS. "Expect reentry in approximately three minutes."
"Steve‚Äî" he said again, finally having the presence of mind to tap him on the shoulder. "Honey, let's get on the bed. Like, right the hell
‚Äîthey had somehow managed to get even
"Steve!" exclaimed Bucky. "Are you‚Äîare you
Tony, I swear if we don't get into our bedroom soon, I'm gonna‚Äî"
"And you as well, Mr Stark." With a final nod, Lang turned towards the door, pausing with his hand on the doorknob. "Um‚Ä¶ are you guys gonna call Hank, or should I? 'Cause I'm sure he's wondering what‚Äî"
Just like the PTSD had ravaged his and Papa‚Äôs minds.
"All right, all right," Steve said, fighting against the urge to scream as the white light grew even brighter still. This was so much harder than going through it himself.
"Mmm," grumbled Peter. "I was just watching the goofy video from Pietro and Wanda. It's really no big deal."
Which, come to think of it, was probably why Bucky had bought it all.
Shuffling onto the ship, Tony immediately grimaced at the stale, musky smell, one that reminded him way too much of the Compound's gym after one of Clint and Bucky's sparring sessions. The smell was so overwhelming at first that Tony had to briefly stick his head back outside, swallowing down the rising bile in his throat.
And of course Peter had told him that he would, even though he knew the truth. Even though he had already accepted that he was going to die. That he was to the point now where he even welcomed the fact that he was going to die.
Steve's jaw twitched as he nodded. "Your old contracts?"
"You should've gone for the head."
replied the doctor, who while masked, gowned, and bent over the tiny, motionless infant lying in the incubator, was someone that Tony instantly recognised.
A huge thank-you to my wonderful betas jehbeeeh and allthesinnersandallthesaints üíó
"No, I can't imagine it is, given all it's been through," Gwen said. "I assume he's under a doctor's care?"
"Thanks. Bye, Uncle Bruce."
"There she is again."
And the sex surely didn't hurt anything either. In fact, as he and Steve clung to each other later that night, with Steve's head resting on his chest, Tony was convinced that there had been far too few clinical studies conducted on the sleep-inducing prowess of orgasms, and that someone really needed to rectify such an oversight.
"Yes, you did," Steve said softly. "And you know that I don't blame you for it. I just really wish that it wasn't true."
They would just have to trust him, trust that they had equipped and trained their son as best as they possibly could, and allow him to fight.
"Oh, ha ha bloody ha," Bucky retorted, in such a perfect impersonation of John Cleese that Steve did a double-take. "I swear, if you say another stinking word about brave Sir Bucky, I'm gonna‚Äî"
After a quick stop off in their room so Tony could change and brush his teeth, they were off. Steve's childhood home was only about fifteen minutes from the base, set in one of the neighbourhoods on the opposite end of town from where Tony had grown up. Steve had explained that his mother and father had moved into their house only a few weeks before Joseph Rogers was killed, wanting to be closer to the hospital since Sarah had had a few minor complications during her pregnancy. The closer proximity had turned out to be a good thing for Steve as well, with his severe breathing attacks getting both worse and more difficult to treat as he got older.
Tony's lips twitched in excitement as he got to his feet, drawing the hologram further away from the counter and enlarging it.
Steve asked. He'd of course heard Tony and Peter mention the word quantum before, usually in the context of discussing their nanotechnology or one of Peter's physics assignments. But he had never heard the term 'realm' used in conjunction with it before.
Peter let out a heavy sigh, his puppy-dog eyes blazing in such full force that a knot rose in Tony's throat. "Look, I'm‚ÄîI'm sorry, Dad, but I just didn't want you to be all alone up here. I mean, you're mainly here anyway because of me, so‚Ä¶"
"Very good, Captain."
myself, if you know what I mean.‚Äù
, what a look!¬† Even there on the floor of his lab and right on the verge of a mental breakdown, Tony still felt a jolt of electricity race down his spine at the memory of just how
"Or what they managed to accomplish. I mean, for all we know all they managed to do is cause another huge mess that'll have to be cleaned up."
And then, as Alt-Steve, Tony, their entire team, and Steve all watched, their boy, their sweet, beloved Peter Stark-Rogers, swung out of the portal in a grand flip, landing on the ground with the grace of a master ballerino. As soon as he stood up his mask retracted, his beautiful brown eyes wide with awe as he took in the scene in front of him.
(See the end of the chapter for
And they broke Peter and Dad‚Äôs hearts every single time, which was why as soon as Dad got the idea for the BARF glasses, he worked almost non-stop until he‚Äôd developed the prototype, sometimes forcing Papa to literally drag him to bed so he could sleep for a couple of hours.
not personally invested in the idea of forcing a superpowered kid to fight against his own father, unfortunately I can't really say the same for the rest of my colleagues, so‚Ä¶ it's probably best that we don't tempt them, don't you think?"
"Tomorrow morning, if you don't mind," said Tony. "Dude's probably left for the day already."
"Oh my God!" Peter breathed into his polar bear's neck, his belly swooping at finding his own name spelled out in a HYDRA document. "They really were trying to get me?"
"And it's not like he'd need to talk all that much once he left the airport," said Natasha from her seat next to Gwen. She had graciously loaned Gwen some clothes so at least the poor girl wasn't sitting around in her fancy dress, but it was already after three in the morning and Tony knew she had to be exhausted.
"Yeah, they're almost all he owns. He wanted to get me a red one, but after Papa read something in a magazine about how cops tend to go after red cars more often, they decided on the blue instead."
Peter glanced over at Gwen, who gave a subtle shake of her head. "I'm sorry, I'm not sure who you mean‚Äî"
"Show us, J. Text only."
"No, Captain. Sorry," said Tony. He sucked in a deep breath, shuffling through his papers for the go/no-go sequences. He'd have to think more about that stuff later; at the moment he needed to concentrate.
, and aside from the fact that that's only a movie, so not real, we all know how well that ended up going."
Steve gave a shudder, his mouth already watering. "Well, all right then. But just remember, I'm gonna take my time."
"But it didn't," said Steve.
"Am," Tony cut in, grinning when Steve gave him a quizzical look. "You were gonna say that you were one of the best pilots around, but in reality there's no comparison. You
could make it work?
"Steve‚Äîbaby‚Äîyou're taking too damn long!" Tony grunted, each of his gasps and moans only adding to the pleasure pooling in Steve's gut. "Please‚Ä¶ honey‚Ä¶ I'm begging you!"
‚ÄúI'll ask Dad about it this weekend,‚Äù he said, grimacing as he noticed his reflection in the mirror, and the curls hanging down so low on his forehead they were tangling in his eyelashes.¬† He definitely needed that haircut.
"But it also means that if the wizard's aware of how we win, and he's refusing to leave, then we should probably do the same," added Gamora.
"Attention all Langaran air support aircraft," came the stern voice of Colonel Matthew O'Brien, commander of the Langaran Army Air Corps. "As of 1426 hours Langaran standard time, which by my watch was exactly three minutes and sixteen seconds ago, a ceasefire has been brokered that calls for an immediate halt of all hostilities between Langaran and Meridian forces in anticipation of a permanent peace treaty. All aircraft are hereby ordered to stand down and return to base immediately."
get out of here.¬† I‚Äôm‚ÄîI‚Äôm‚ÄîI can‚Äôt‚Äî‚Äù
And he would.
He had just grabbed his book from Peter's bedside table when there came a soft knock on the door.
"Yeah," Steve said with wide eyes. "Basically how it went was, I stripped down to my waist, they gave me a bunch of shots, and then set up this kind of infusion device inside what looked like an old missile casing. Once they closed me inside it the infusion device activated, sending the serum into my major muscle groups, and then a few seconds later I got bombarded with some kind of radiation."
Yea: 48, Nay: 50.
After unpacking the day-old croissant and bottle of apple juice he picked up after his PT session, Steve boots up his computer and checks his appointments for the day.¬† There‚Äôs the weekly department head meeting at 10am, which he usually ends up dozing through since most of the discussion never pertains to him.¬† At 1pm he and Coach Dugan have a meeting with a prospective football recruit that Dugan is particularly excited about, if his no less than seven email reminders are any indication.¬† And then at four, there‚Äôs an appointment with some guy who apparently wants Steve to start coaching his kid in swimming.
"Well, I do have a bit of a unique perspective," Steve said with a slight smile. "We'll talk again soon, General. Take care."
"All right, all right," said Uncle Sam. "Go ahead and try, but I'm afraid he's just gonna see right through it." He let out a heavy sigh. "When's the next time we're supposed to hear from Steve?"
‚ÄúOh, you're welcome, Mr Rogers!¬† Or should I say, Captain Rogers?‚Äù the lady replied with a giggle.¬† ‚ÄúAnd I know you probably get this all the time, but I‚Äôve just gotta say, you're even better looking in person than you are in the magazines!¬† Mr Stark sure is a lucky guy.‚Äù
"Because in all of my time as a youth engrossed in my studies on Asgard, I never elected to learn how to fly such a vessel," Thor said, rather petulantly. "And therefore I did not learn how to land such a vessel either."
"Good," said Grandpa. "Now, about the satellites. I'm thinking that we should‚Äî"
‚ÄúOh, you won‚Äôt find a better chess player than Pete,‚Äù Tony said.¬† ‚ÄúOr a more patient teacher.‚Äù
"Tony, I don't want to‚Äî" he started, lowering his fork when Tony quirked an eyebrow. "It was just a bad dream, mo gr√°. Nothing more than that."
‚ÄúSo‚Ä¶ what was that all about?‚Äù Natasha suddenly asks from outside the wall, sending Steve‚Äôs heart rocketing to his throat.¬† In almost a year of working together, Steve still isn‚Äôt used to how quietly his co-worker can move about the office.¬† Natasha says it‚Äôs because she trained as a ballet dancer from a young age, and so was taught how to take very light steps, but Steve also has a sneaking suspicion that she thinks it‚Äôs funny whenever she startles him.
‚ÄúYeah, gotcha.‚Äù¬† Tony tilted his head, pondering.¬† The last thing he felt like doing was dealing with the Board of Directors, who no doubt would spend the entire scheduled time whining about something or other, but since he‚Äôd already pushed off the meeting at least three times he was certain that Pepper would have his head if he attempted to do so again.¬† May as well get it over with while he was already grumpy.
"Tony, I just want you to calm down first!" protested Steve. "Please, sweetheart! If you go bursting into Peter's room like this, all you're gonna do is scare him!"
causing his stomach to give a violent lurch.
"There it is," Peter whispered as his gaze landed on the gloomy dark grey building, barely visible through the thick mist hanging in the air. The Iron Legion wannabes were still flying their sentry routes around the perimeter, so Peter took a couple of minutes to memorise their pattern and calculate an approximate distance so he could program the repulsors to shut down at the right time. It wouldn't do him any good to blow the entire thing by crashing into the side of the building because he'd miscalculated the flight time.
"No matter what," Tony said firmly. "I swore to him before I even brought him home that I'd do whatever it took to keep him safe. And I knew I'd make a million mistakes, and I have, 'cause hey, it's me. But I also knew even back then that Pete was something special. That someday, he'd blow us all away."
"Yep. Gotta show 'em who's boss," said Bucky. He gulped down the last of his superwater, swiping his wrist across his mouth. "How much do you wanna bet that it'll be the best thing you've ever flown?"
"I'll go with you," said Bucky as he rapidly downed his third glass of whisky. "See ya later, Stevie."
"Ah, and you're just as much of a flatterer as your papa," she said as Steve released her. She stepped back, her steel-blue eyes looking Tony up and down before offering her hand, her knuckles swollen and slightly bent with arthritis.
Tony rolled his eyes, then grabbed Steve's face in his hands, planting a very loud, very sloppy, and very exaggerated kiss right on his lips that almost caused him to drop the tablet.
Hammer Industries is being sold off, so what went on down there had to have been huge!"
‚ÄúYou sleep good, bud, yeah?‚Äù Tony murmurs as he tucks Peter‚Äôs blankets up to his neck.¬† He‚Äôs so tired that his eyes are already closed, his beloved stuffed polar bear held tightly in his arms.
"Guess I may as well get started," Peter mumbled as he pulled up the corresponding website, which showed a list of the bills in PDF form. He scrolled through the list, bypassing several that he assumed would be chosen by his classmates since they were short, and therefore quicker to read through.
"That's my boy," murmured Steve. He leaned down, kissing Peter's forehead. "I'll see you soon."
Tony was just beginning to stir when Steve got to the bedroom, opening one sleepy eye as Steve stripped out of his sweaty running clothes.
"Mmm," Steve muttered, his attention drawn back to the television screen, where President Cole had just been joined onstage by his wife and grown son. "Do we know anything about the son?"
Maybe he would be a bit more courageous once they were out from under his dads'‚Äîand JARVIS's‚Äîeyes, and he could just flat-out ask Gwen how she felt about him.
And finally, his beautiful, perfect cock, straining hard against the sheets even in sleep.
"Just try and relax, honey," he murmured as he pressed open-mouthed kisses all along Steve's length before finally taking as much of him as he could into his mouth. Steve let out another guttural puff of air as he started to move, his fingers weaving into Tony's hair to massage his scalp. It'd been over a decade since Tony had given someone a blowjob, and his jaw seemed to have lost all of its muscle memory, but from the way Steve was gasping and panting above him he didn't seem to care.
Tony thought as he took a big sip of his coffee.¬† Then he leaned back in his chair, folding his hands behind his head.
That at least had managed to pull a short laugh out of Steve. He couldn't imagine the look on Phillips' face if he'd gone up and asked to be relieved from his patrol just because he'd had an argument with his boyfriend.
"Okay, for one, his name is Mr Stark to you, Doctor," Peter said firmly. "And two, I'm pretty sure we're all in agreement on that one, so it's not really worth repeating. My papa wanted the Time Stone brought to Wakanda, so that's where we should bring it."
He cleared his throat as he activated the panic room microphone.
Peter nodded, burrowing further into his blankets and closing his eyes, trying to focus only on the sound of his dads' heartbeats rather than the searing pain in his limbs. He highly doubted that Papa would get any sleep that night, especially if he was stuck so deep inside his own fears like he was.
"You can't tell Colonel Rhodes that I told you, all right?" Uncle Bucky finally said. "I don't want Sam getting into any trouble because of something I did."
Meant that‚Äî
Tony shot him one of Peter's
.¬† The bone-chilling, blood-freezing, and lung-seizing kind that Steve had experienced only twice before.¬† Once during the bout of pneumonia he‚Äôd had when he was ten, when his fever climbed to over forty-one Celsius and his teeth chattered so hard that he chipped one of his incisors, and the second time when he‚Äôd slipped into the frigid water of the Arctic, trapped under three hundred tonnes of massive airplane.
"Hold tight, little guy!" Steve called over the escalating noise, much like an airplane preparing for takeoff. "Peter, just‚Ä¶ don't let go of me!"
Crossing his arms into what Peter always called his Papa pose, Steve shifted on his feet, trying to force himself to think rationally, and then almost laughing at the absurdity of it. Rationality didn't really exist anymore. Not at the moment, at least. Half the world had just been snapped away by a giant purple being wearing a fancy bejewelled glove.
‚ÄúNo!‚Äù Tony forced between his clenched teeth as he helped Peter to his feet, tucking him behind him.¬† ‚ÄúJust‚Ä¶ don't!¬† Don't you dare try and say anything else!¬† You fucking broke his finger, Steve!¬† I need‚ÄîI need to get him to a doctor!‚Äù
Peter blinked, swallowing hard. "Uhh, well, that's good, but now‚Äî"
"I love you too, honey."
"We're all ready, Steve," Carol said. "Let's get this show on the road."
Mr Jarvis had always said. It was never just a simple 'your welcome', like most people offered‚Äîwhen they bothered to offer it at all. It was always 'you are
"Mmm, all right," Tony finally said. "I'll set up another trip for tomorrow."
The mess could wait, though. He still had two more bags to get through. May as well save it all till the end.
‚ÄúYou mean we're in the Twilight Zone or something?‚Äù he asks.¬† ‚ÄúThat dumb show that Clint loves so much?‚Äù
"Don't‚Äîdon't turn away from me now. I need you. I can't‚ÄîI can't do this by myself. I just can't. Please!"
And they were all looking to him to lead it.
Or give Gwen even more reason to hover. He already got more than enough of that from his dads and the rest of the adults in his family, thank you very much.
Steve closed his eyes, allowing his body to relax into the mattress and reveling in the closeness of his beloved husband, the husband he had been so close to having to say goodbye to only moments before.
"Uh huh. See ya."
"That's what I thought," Steve whispered as he dipped his head, brushing his lips so lightly across Tony's that at first he thought he might've imagined it. He pulled back, his blue eyes intense as they bored into Tony's, while his free hand slid down Tony's front, fiddling with the frayed hem of the tank top.
"Nah, you know you don't have to apologise to me," Rhodey said as he hobbled over to sit down on a corner of the desk. He clapped a hand on Tony's shoulder, squeezing it gently. "Just remember that you're not in this alone, okay? There's a lot of people out there who care about both you and Peter."
knew that you were supposed to squeeze it from the bottom and roll it up as you went, not from the middle like Dad did.
"Yeah, but that should be okay if we strictly follow the rules of time-travel, right?" asked Scott. "I mean, like no talking to our future selves, no betting on sporting events, no‚Äî"
And while Tony wasn't complaining too much about not getting hounded by reporters, the fact that it almost seemed as though the news outlets were being discouraged from reporting on the incident did not sit well with either Steve or Tony. Natasha and Clint had attempted to question Raxton inside the theatre after Thor had taken him down, but they weren't able to get much of anything from him aside from the fact that he had been experimented on at the Mongolian bunker, and that he had been programmed to go after Peter.
"This thing's got Tony and Peter trapped under the water!" Steve cried. "Peter's been submerged for over three minutes now!"
"Yeah, but that's because he couldn't tolerate anyone talking smack about the people he cared about." Bucky leaned forward, lowering his voice. "I'm not saying anything specific, but wouldn't it be nice to be able to have a day off more than once every couple of months? Maybe even be able to keep our lights on at night? Sam and I talk about that stuff all the time."
"What in the hell do you think you're doing?" he murmured as the aircraft's back engine suddenly engaged with a near-deafening
Slowly, Steve turned his head, his swollen and split lower lip trembling as his battered but still-gorgeous blue eyes attempted to focus in on Tony's face.
"You look good with your glasses on. I'm surprised you don't just wear them all the time," Gwen said casually as they made their way down the hall, past one of the janitor's closets that was hanging open for some reason. Peter had noticed that the school had hired a new janitor after he came back from Christmas break, but unlike most of the others, this one hadn't taken the time to introduce himself to the students, even purposefully avoiding eye contact with them as they filed out of the gym after Decathlon practise.
"Peter Stark, please," he said to the operator, drumming his fingertips on the desk while he waited.
‚ÄúYeah, well, maybe that‚Äôs what you need to finish up that missile ahead of schedule, yeah?‚Äù Obie shot back.¬† He shuffled over to the Scotch bottle he kept in Tony‚Äôs office, pouring himself another double-shot.¬† ‚Äú‚ÄòCause it seems like I‚Äôve gotta light a fire under you to get you to do anything lately.‚Äù
"Are you too tired?" Steve asked as his hands slipped around Tony's waist, drawing him flush against him. Heat bloomed across Tony's chest at the underlying desperation in Steve's voice, and it was all he could do to quickly shake his head before Steve claimed his lips, kissing him like he hadn't kissed him in months.
"It is time," he said, sounding almost freakishly like Rafiki from the Lion King.
Little Steve said again, barely managing to catch a drop of his ice cream before it hit the polished floor. "
‚ÄúWhy're you being such an asshole all of a sudden?‚Äù he asked.¬† ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not like you to care this much about any of my so-called side projects, so‚Ä¶ what‚Äôs the deal?¬† Why is this one pissing you off so bad?‚Äù
he's even smarter than me, so you'd do well to show him some respect."
Someday.
"Very good, Captain," JARVIS said after a short pause. "Mr Lang can now hear you."
"What?" Steve said, looking up just in time to see what appeared to be a row of giant, razor-sharp clock gears burrow their way under the ground outside the force shield, only to reappear on the inside a few seconds later.
"This little guy likes to sit outside my window sometimes," Peter said. "I've named him Cashew."
Peter cried, his belly swooping in horror as the sand grains melded together to form what appeared to be an actual person made out of sand.
Doctor List smirked, his eyes crinkling behind his thick spectacles.¬† ‚ÄúMy colleagues and I have been very eager to meet you for a long time, Captain.¬† Very eager indeed.¬† I have been studying the work of Abraham Erskine for most of my life, but unfortunately I have never been quite able to replicate the miracle that he created in you.¬† As a scientist, this has been immensely frustrating for me, as I‚Äôm sure you can understand.‚Äù
Here‚Äôs where stuff gets a bit technical.  Please understand that this is researched to the best of my ability, but while I am a medical professional, I am not a physicist, so if what I discuss in this chapter is not completely correct physics-wise, please don‚Äôt come after me üòä.
"It doesn't matter if you believe me or not," Tony said as he slipped his fingers underneath Steve's waistband, palming his glorious ass. His breath hitched as Steve shuddered, right before Steve's hands suddenly slid down Tony's body to his thighs, hoisting him into his arms.
"Ah, 183.84 u," replied Peter.
"Yes, only a bit," answered Steve. He shrugged slightly, giving Tony his
"Copy that," Steve said. He glanced back at Peter and Bucky, giving them the signal to take their positions behind the stack of debris about five metres away. The team had already managed to take down three of the twelve enemy targets originally scouted by Redwing; one by Clint, using the brand-new arrowheads that Tony had made for him, one by Pietro Maximoff, in quite impressive fashion, Steve might add, and the third by Peter, who, Steve had to admit, was performing even beyond he and Tony's wildest expectations.
Tony sighed as he pulled back, looking deeply into Steve's eyes. "You know this'll just be another temporary fix though, right? I mean, don't get me wrong, I am completely, like
‚ÄúPlease, sweetheart,‚Äù Steve begged as he broke away from Tony‚Äôs mouth, kissing a path down his cheek to his pulse point.¬† ‚ÄúPlease, I need‚ÄîI need‚Äî‚Äù
"Sure thing."
"Well, for right now we're just gonna sit here until Bruce needs me to take over," Tony said quietly. "And then once we're able to leave here we're gonna go home, give Pete a few of those bear hugs that he loves so much, and then we're gonna get started on the next part of your plan to eliminate HYDRA. And then maybe once that's done, we can both breathe a little easier. Okay?"
"Do you want me to come in there with you?" Peter asked. "I'd kinda like to see how your arm works too, if that's okay. I think it's really cool."
"Yeah, okay," Tony murmured. There was no way in hell he'd be able to rest with Steve out in space, and he knew Phillips knew it, but at least he was trying.
"Not as excited as the pilots were." Tony's heart fluttered as his mind immediately drifted to Captain Rogers, and how damn good he had looked in his flight suit.
He was just leaning down for another kiss when Gwen's door flew open, so hard that it bounced off the opposite wall. Peter let out a squeak as he jumped back, whipping his arms from Gwen so fast that she stumbled forward.
"That's a perfect name for a squirrel," he said as he scooted closer. "I love it!"
Swiping his sweat-dampened hair from his eyes, Steve planted his feet and threw another punch, one so strong that it broke the skin on his middle finger's knuckle, leaving a bright smear of blood across the bag's ivory canvas. Biting down on his bottom lip, Steve wound up again, driving his left fist so hard into the bag that it flew off its hook and slammed into the wall, sending sand scattering across the floor. He immediately cried out, both from the pain and from the fact that he now had yet another big mess to clean up.
"Peter, it's okay," Steve cut in as he reached for their joined hands, peeling Peter's fingers away from Tony's and wrapping them around his own. Tony's face was ashen, his beautiful eyes glassy and tortured as they locked with Steve's.
Steve sniffed as he gathered Tony close again, rubbing soothing circles on his back. "Sweetheart, you're not gonna lose either of us. I promise."
"Yeah, I bet he got a kick outta that," muttered Tony. "Thanks, J. Tell Pete that we miss him once he wakes up in the morning, yeah? And we'll hopefully see him soon? Tell him Papa will make him some hot chocolate when we get home, he'll love that."
He was absolutely serious.
"I have already done so, Captain," said JARVIS. "We are ready."
‚ÄúGoddamn taxis!‚Äù Tony yelped as he finally got the stupid sunglasses onto his face.¬† He swiped a tear from his stinging eye and drew in a deep breath, wishing he‚Äôd thought to bring some coffee along.¬† ‚ÄúBuddy, what the hell are you talking about?¬† And who the hell‚Äôs Steve?‚Äù
"Shh, little guy," murmured Steve. "I promise it's okay. It's not the first time that I've had my nose broken, Uncle Bucky can attest to that." He shot Tony a look of fear mixed with relief. "Dad and I are just really, really happy to have you back again."
"JARVIS?" he asked. "Did Dad already go inside the ship?"
, the complete lack of another viable option, that was almost worse than the need for the serum itself. They only had one shot, and if it failed‚Ä¶
Peter made a frustrated noise. What was it about grownups and their goofy ideas when it came to the people they loved?
"Yes, but how does he decide what constitutes a mission?" asked Mr Stacy. "Gwen told us that the Avengers were just gone on one of these missions for over a week, but yet no one knows exactly what they were doing."
A murmured chorus of, "Yes, sir" arose from the seated pilots as Captain Rogers raised his hand, the wrinkle of concern still evident between his blond eyebrows.
"Ah, yeah," Steve said, flustered as he checked his timepiece. It was already nearly 1900 hours, more than an hour after he had planned to be back. "Actually, I was just leaving."
"Guys, it's Rumlow," Steve said as he got to his feet, managing to slide underneath Rumlow's next tank shot just in time. "I've got him in my sights."
"Oh, we'll see," Papa whispered. "You don't need to worry about me, little guy. I've got you."
A really fucking
Tony was just about done tweaking a couple of settings on the latest design of Natasha's Widow's Bites when JARVIS announced that the three of them had arrived, with Steve and Thor's heavy footsteps and Peter's lighter ones heading toward the lab a few seconds later.
"Station chiefs in both Savannah and Atlanta are on alert, and I've also brought the deputy chief of D.C.'s largest precinct up-to-speed on what's going on, minus a few relevant details, of course," he hastily added when Tony shot him a sharp look. The fact that George Stacy now knew without a doubt that Peter was Spider-Man was making him sick to his stomach, but he was just going to have to get over it. There was no turning back now.
"I agree," said Fury. "And you're welcome. Now, I'm sure I don't have to remind you that this information is only on a need-to-know basis. You have permission to share it with your team, Captain, but no one else."
its arrival, reaching for Tony's hand again as they stepped inside, his fingertip rubbing back and forth along the smooth metal of the ring on Tony's third finger.
(See the end of the chapter for
"Ahh‚Ä¶ no, ma'am," he stammered, shaking his head. "Sorry 'bout that."
With a downright evil grin, Steve leaned over, his lips brushing the shell of Tony's ear as he whispered, "Just a temporary stop though, right, sweetheart?"
Pursing his lips, Peter adjusted the mask covering his face and squeezed his eyes closed, preparing to jump from the wall.
"Then don't, 'cause it won't help anything," Sam said firmly. "Tony, we're pretty much trapped inside a tin can here. We need to get this place opened up somehow or they'll just end up squashing us like a bunch of bugs."
And he was right. In fact, during the two-plus hours of car ride, Peter was certain that his cheeks managed to achieve a level of pinkness never before attained in his lifetime.
‚ÄúYeah, I‚Äôm sure I‚Äôll be able to introduce you sometime soon,‚Äù Steve says.¬† ‚ÄúOur practises are gonna be from five to seven every evening, so maybe after a couple of weeks you can head down and say hi.‚Äù
"Probably because he's starting to warm up a bit," said Tony. "And the reentry will help with that too." Steve would still have to be checked out at the hospital, and Tony was just about to pick up the phone and order an emergency transport when Colonel Phillips suddenly burst into the Control Room, followed directly by Rhodey, Carol, and Sam.
"Just make sure to actually pick 'em up first, okay, Ro?" added Clint. "We don't want another dragging incident like the last time, right?"
"Nope, we're not going there," Tony said, covering Steve's lips with his fingers. "You know you don't have to be sorry. Well, maybe for falling flat on your face 'cause you were too stubborn to wake me up, but‚Ä¶ not for the rest of it. You were a prisoner of war, honey, and I'm just relieved that Pete was able to find you."
"No matter what happens, I want you to know that I will always love you. You and Peter have brought me so much joy in these last few months, joy that I never thought I was even remotely capable of feeling. You were the two pieces of my life that I never even knew I was missing, and for that I want to thank you."
Sam would call that avoidance, and Tony supposed that Sam would be correct, but hell, sometimes it was just a hell of a lot easier to not think about everything that sucked in your life and try to have some fun anyway.
his traitorous mind said, sending a wave of such overwhelming anguish through his body that he gasped, drawing the attention of Bucky sitting on the bench across from him.
How could he ever forget something like that?
"Mmmhmm?"
"No way in hell," Tony shot back. "The suit can take it and I'm not leaving him."
Again, Tony waited until Bucky gave a nod before grabbing his pressurised air container. "Pete, you wanna grab him a chair? And I'm gonna need you to help hold his arm steady, all right?"
"Seems like that first attack didn't take out the entire payload after all," added Sam. "The soldiers are all making their way up to the third floor."
Whoever the guy was had a gun to his head. This was definitely
"And tell us the second you get a signal," added Natasha. "I wanna know who's on the other end of that thing."
If it wasn't for Tony and Peter‚Äôs support during the last year‚Äîactually, ever since SHIELD pulled him from the ice‚ÄîSteve isn‚Äôt sure what he would've done.
Since it had already been over an hour since he'd eaten, Steve prepared enough for the two of them, deliberately setting aside his work so he could focus exclusively on his son while they ate. He listened intently as Peter talked about everything from the latest Lego set he was coveting to the experiment he and Gwen were running in their chemistry lab, something having to do with designing a new type of Plexiglass. It seemed so normal, as the two of them had talked over breakfast hundreds of times before, especially given Tony's lack of appreciation for mornings. But this time, for some reason, it seemed to hit Steve a bit differently.
"Nope, no buts," Tony repeated, shaking his head as Redwing swooped down from the sky and disappeared inside the Quinjet. "So, what's the plan?"
Peter's eyes went wide. "Uhh, can you ask me that again in a few minutes?"
"I don't need you to tell me that," Tony said quietly. "I know my own kid, thank you."
But he'd barely taken three steps out of the kitchen when JARVIS suddenly came over the speakers.
‚ÄúI do know that, Pete,‚Äù Tony stated.¬† ‚ÄúBut you've gotta understand that‚Äî‚Äù
"Uh huh," said Peter. "Well, I just drew it. My dad'll be the one who'll build it."
Tony's eyebrows knitted together as he picked up his coffee cup. "Yeah? So?"
"No, no, it's not for chemistry this time, Dad," Peter said as he handed Tony the paper. "It's for History."
Tony was so deep in thought that he didn't even realise how fast he was walking until he rounded the final corner towards his office and proceeded to slam directly into a solid wall, dropping him flat on his ass and sending his glasses skittering across the floor.
Tony said as he kissed the same spot again, pulling a low moan from Steve's throat. "And I intend to discover more of those places tonight, as long as you're up for it."
Tony threw up his hands. "Fine! So what's so important that you have to‚Äî"
, Tony. So unbelievably angry that he would have the
Steve rang the damn doorbell‚Äî
"Copy that, hon," Tony said, the sound of his repulsors booming across the sky as he, James, Quill, and Sam all swooped down, firing at the Chitauri squadron like a quartet of P-52 Mustangs. Their barrage of fire was so strong that they managed to knock several of the Chitauri into Thanos, pushing him to the ground while Carol took care of the rest of the Chitauri guards, vaporising them with powerful energy blasts from her fists.
Tony's fists were tightly clenched as he paced back and forth in his lab, the not-so-calm discussion he'd just had with Fury still echoing inside his mind. Fury had assured Tony months ago that every single member of the former STRIKE team had been accounted for, and that Rumlow was likely fish food at the bottom of the Potomac following the crash of the three Project Insight helicarriers.
‚ÄúOkay, little guy.‚Äù¬† Closing his eyes, Papa tipped his head back, his eyebrows knitting together in concentration.
"And don't you even think about arguing with me, you got that?" Dad snapped before Peter could barely get a word out. "You're already in hot water, don't you go adding more to it!"
The drive to the school passed in a blur, and before Tony knew it, he was forcing a plastered smile onto his face as he pulled into the parking lot, where Peter was waiting with his friends outside the doors.
Instead, it was Gwen Stacy.
"Dad's right, little guy," said Steve. "You're so strong, there's no way they can get you."
"For all we know, she's already fighting some other battle on some other planet," said Tony. He dragged his gaze over to Bruce, raising an eyebrow. "Think you can get the other guy to show up, like Steve saw? Seems like him and the giant bug man were working pretty well together."
With a sigh, Peter opened his algebra textbook and started copying down notes, barely looking at his paper since he already understood the principles being presented by the teacher. As much as he hated to admit it, he really, really missed his dads. Uncle James and Uncle Bucky were doing their best to keep Peter distracted but it still wasn't the same, and it didn't help at all that this series of raids seemed to have so much more riding on them than the ones in the past.
"No, I'm pretty sure that I didn't either," Steve said. He let out a soft groan when Tony's long fingers wound around to the back of his neck, kneading the tight muscles there. "Mmm, that feels good."
‚ÄúI‚Äôm fine, sweetheart.¬† I promise,‚Äù Steve insisted.¬† ‚ÄúJust feeling a bit‚Ä¶ sentimental, I guess.‚Äù
Natasha let out a heavy sigh as she got to her feet. "Well‚Ä¶ maybe you'll change your mind once your hands are healed up, so‚Ä¶ just take it easy for awhile, okay? I'll come back and see ya later."
"Well, not all of us," started Green Lady. "But he‚Äî"
"Accounting for the possibility of human error, that makes sense," agreed Tony. "But what are the chances of success if we're not able to secure the tesseract?"
"Well, you're right. It does sound cold," snapped Tony. "It sounds damn cold."
Stacy gave him a sympathetic look. "It's true, Mr Stark. Gwen told me just before we came here that she figured it out quite a while ago."
They found George and Gwen Stacy in Peter's room, just where Steve had left them. As soon as they stepped inside, George Stacy shot to his feet, explaining that Peter's vital signs hadn't wavered in the slightest while they were gone.
And Tony knew that Steve felt the same way, especially since he often lamented about the fact that he had missed out on the majority of Peter's childhood.
"I think we do, Mr Lang," Steve said as Tony shook Lang's hand. "There's nothing wrong with giving someone a second chance, as I'm sure Mr Pym tried to explain to you. But those second chances should never lead you right back into what got you into trouble in the first place, as I'm sure you'll now agree."
"Yeah," Peter whispered back. "He's Iron Man."
And later that evening, once all of the data had been checked over and collated and Papa had called Uncle Sam and Uncle Bucky to tell them the happy news, the three of them piled onto the living room couch with popcorn and lemonade to watch a movie.¬† Peter took his usual spot between his dads, leaning back against Papa with his legs across Dad‚Äôs lap, while Papa‚Äôs long arm rested across both of their shoulders.
Tony moaned as Steve hoisted him into his arms and carried him over to the massive bed, laying him gently down. He crawled up to hover over him, trailing his fingertips down Tony's cheek as Tony glided his palms up Steve's strong arms.
"Well, it's about goddamn time!" he heard Tony say not even a second later as he flew past the Suburban. "Waiting to make a dramatic entrance, I see? How typical!"
"It would've been a waste of parts!" Thanos snapped as he swung his massive fist, sending Nebula sailing backwards right into Gamora's arms. A second later Dr Strange conjured up a set of long, red ropes, wrapping them around Thanos' hand in an attempt to force him to open his fist.
"Good." Tony cupped Steve's cheeks in his hands, brushing his tears away with his thumbs before stepping back, shaking his head as his lips twitched into a smirk. "Look at you. Even all bandaged up you're still hotter than hell."
It was taking all of Steve's strength to keep from breaking down completely.
Another sharp cry from the table sent a massive shiver rocketing down Steve's spine as Image Peter started thrashing from side to side, trying to break from the metal bands holding down his limbs.
Unfortunately, it never was long enough, and soon enough he and Tony were both crying out as they spilled over their joined hands. Steve collapsed down on Tony once he was spent, tears welling in his eyes and dripping onto Tony's hair before he even realised they were there.
"Very good, Master Peter," replied JARVIS. "And please, be careful."
Or, more like began sputtering, thanks to his gimpy left pinky, but anyway‚Ä¶
This is not his first Championship meet, the State High School finals, or even the Olympic Trials.¬† This is the Olympics.¬† The very pinnacle of elite swimming competition.¬† And while Steve knows that he‚Äôs as prepared for this race as he‚Äôll ever be, it‚Äôs still impossible for him to pretend that it‚Äôs ‚Äòjust another race‚Äô.
Peter wrinkled his nose, but nodded anyway. "Uh huh."
And then the one time that he didn't, when he finally decided to throw caution into the wind and reopen his heart, it just ended up getting smashed to pieces.
"Oh, thank the
"Bug man?" Scott asked, frowning. "I'm Ant-Man, and ants are not the same as just your average bug. In fact‚Äî"
Tony suddenly cut in from next to one of the capsules, causing Steve to whip around. He'd been so stunned by everything else that he hadn't even realised Tony had left his side. "Steve, these are‚ÄîI think these are stasis pods!"
‚ÄúWell, if there is, I‚Äôm sure you‚Äôll find it,‚Äù Dad said.¬† ‚ÄúLook, bud, I gotta‚Äî‚Äù
expecting his heart to do that silly teenage fluttering thing as soon as he laid eyes on the man.¬† His own expertly groomed goatee aside, Tony‚Äôs not usually one to be attracted to guys with facial hair, but there was something about Steve‚Äôs blond beard with just the slightest touch of strawberry that went so perfectly with his chiseled jawline and gorgeous cheekbones that the very second they locked eyes, Tony was struck almost speechless.¬† Combine that with Steve‚Äôs slightly wavy blond hair, his piercing blue eyes that almost exactly matched the clear blue water in the pool, and the way he somehow managed to pull off that dark green plaid button-up shirt that for all intents and purposes no man under the age of seventy should ever dream of wearing‚Ä¶ well‚Ä¶
Family.
And he was there when Steve nearly drowned after his plunge into the river‚Äôs ice-cold water, an experience that Steve still relives in his sleep far, far too often.
"Damn right," said Clint, as if he'd heard Steve's thought. "'Cause I don't know 'bout the rest of you, but I've about had my fill of this asshole."
"I don't know the name of it," said Wanda. "All I know is that HYDRA stole it from a country that's known only in legends."
A little slice of familiarity in what‚Äôs still a pretty unfamiliar world.
And while Peter could understand why his dads weren't ready for the world to be aware of the existence of his abilities quite yet‚Äîespecially since he wasn't really ready either‚Äîit still didn't seem fair that he couldn't tell anyone that
"Shh, Peter, it's okay," Papa whispered as he patted Peter's back. "I'm scared too. But what we have to try and remember is that we're stronger than our fear, okay? And as long as we all stick together, there's no way that our fear can win."
"Well, I guess I'll see you tomorrow?" Peter asked just as Chief Stacy pulled into the parking lot in his unmarked police car.
Steve stumbled backwards, trying to scream, but with no air in his lungs it only came out as a sort of choked gasp as he stared at his husband, his beloved fella, the man he had sworn to love, honour, and protect as long as he should live.
"Now then, Mr Stark," Davis began. "If you don't mind, I'd like to begin with a few questions regarding the various weapons contracts that your company Stark Industries used to hold with the U.S. Military."
have you done to my son?"
"Yeah, hon, I kinda already guessed that since you're not currently glistening with sweat," Tony said with a wink. "Still waiting on the why, though."
"All right," Peter said as he finished setting up the new laptop, nearly doubling his memory capacity and processing speed. Cracking his knuckles, he proceeded to upload the new JARVIS override that he had finished writing during his Government class earlier that day, adding a couple of finishing touches to the coding to make sure that it couldn't be traced.
out of practise on his flirting techniques. He tugged on the collar of his t-shirt as he cleared his throat, very grateful that Anthony couldn't see him at the moment since his face was likely the colour of an overripe tomato.
And in those battles, they had almost lost Peter three separate times.
"Peter‚Äî"
Dad pursed his lips as he looked over at Papa, who tilted his head and frowned. Peter couldn't quite tell if it was the, I'm-not-sure-about-this frown, or the I'll-let-you-decide-sweetheart frown, but he knew it was at least one of the two possibilities.
"And yet, they're agreeing to it 'cause you pitched it to 'em," Tony had replied. "They trust you, honey. They believe in you."
he screamed inside his head, the tears flowing even faster when no answer came.
"Sweetheart,
"Then we'll have to figure out a way to get the stones Thanos already does have away from him," said Tony. "And once we've got 'em, we can stick 'em down a garbage disposal or something."
Understanding dawned on Quill's face, and he winced in Gamora's direction. "Oh, yeah. Sorry."
"Yeah," Tony said quickly, huffing when Steve raised an eyebrow. "Yeah, I'm fine. Actually more than fine. Just‚Ä¶ trying to take it all in, is all."
"Too bad you didn't kill me when you had the chance!" yelled the android‚ÄîNebula, apparently.
"See? I told ya you were exhausted," Tony murmured.
It was so gradual that he must have just dismissed it at the time, but now that he thought about it, it was definitely louder than it had been when he'd first noticed it, slicing through the blood rushing past his ears straight into his pain centre.
Hadn't he spent the last two-plus years ensuring that that very thing was impossible? Ever since Obie and his HYDRA goons had managed to override JARVIS and break into the Tower in order to steal Peter from right under his and Steve's noses, Tony had sworn up, down, sideways, and diagonally that he would never,
"Yeah, okay," Peter said rapidly. "But will you come back once you find him? My papa is hurt, and I need to get him out of here so the doctor can help him."
Tony‚Äôs heart flipped as Obie‚Äôs eyes first went wide, then narrowed, which Tony knew from previous experience meant he was about to pull out the Howard card.
So far the only downside to the new project had been that Tony could not yet work on it during normal business hours.¬† While he had told Obie straight-up about the rehiring of the scientists and the resumption of the drug trials, he had left out a few of the more major details of what they were going to be working on, forcing him to stay late every single night that week and essentially abandon Peter to Steve‚Äôs bookstore until close to 6pm.
Whatever else he might have said was drowned out by Thor's ear splitting cry as he flung his axe in Thanos' direction, which Thanos then batted away with his blade as though it was nothing more than a toy.

"Okay, now we're just splitting hairs," Tony said. "Regardless of the wording used, you're under eighteen and therefore still under our care. And while you're still under our care, Papa and I are going to expect you to follow the rules that we set down, which, may I remind you, are there because we love you and want you to be safe." He paused, cupping Peter's face in his hands and silently begging him to understand. "Pete, you could've been
‚ù§ = you wish you could kudos again
‚ÄúYeah, Papa?‚Äù Peter asked when Steve paused, taking a deep breath.¬† ‚ÄúSomething wrong?‚Äù
"Hey‚Äî!" Peter exclaimed.
Peter smiled, reaching to tuck a stray hair behind her ear and wishing that he could kiss her instead. Their hurried first kiss right before he'd escaped out through the boys' room window had been incredible, better than he'd ever imagined it would be, and he was very much looking forward to some more practise.
Which, after recent events, sounded just fine to Steve.
Peter's two dads, who seemed to be so stunned by his appearance that they were frozen in place, gaping at him like they weren't sure if he was real or just a mirage.
"Don't you
"Jesus Christ, Pete! What the hell are you doing up there?" Tony exclaimed, sucking in a deep breath as his heart slowly meandered its way out of his throat. It wasn't the first time that he and Steve had found Peter sitting up by the ceiling, and knowing Peter it wouldn't be the last either.
"Master Peter has just fallen asleep, sir," JARVIS answered. "I am sorry."
That was Steve-code for 'get ready to pack him off to Asgard', but at the moment Tony was too upset to think of much of anything besides getting his husband out of the vile clutches of the three HYDRA agents standing in front of him.
unless you listen."
The battle that had ended in Thanos' defeat, rather than in the death of billions of people.
Unfortunately, his desire for expanding the range of the security drones to be able to cover both Peter's school and the route between it and the Tower had hit a rather frustrating roadblock, one that he hadn't yet figured out how to get around. As he had told Steve back in the beginning, the drones were basically a very hi-tech home security system, so stationing them around the Tower and Compound was perfectly fine.
(See the end of the chapter for
"How bad is the pain, Peter, on a scale of one to ten?" asked Dr Cho as she tested Peter's reflexes.
"I'm working on it, Steve!" Hill snapped. "We weren't exactly prepared for an ambush here!"
‚ÄîTony attempted to turn his attention back to his workstation, where JARVIS' blinking cursor sat patiently waiting. There was only about an hour or so left in the patrol and he was hoping to get Phillips to sign off on the simulator protocols so he could start implementing them ASAP.
"Thank you," Steve whispered as he followed the corporal into a grand outer office that was at least twice as large as Steve's barracks room.
"Flashman, you've got incoming!" Tony cried as pieces of his target suddenly shot out in all directions. "Get 'em outta there!" In a burst of flying debris Pietro took off, gathering Natasha into his arms and disappearing.
"Yeah, they're all having a ball," said Phillips, not without a hint of nostalgia. "Almost makes me wonder if you designed those things to be a bit too much fun."
‚ÄúWhy‚Äôre you asking?‚Äù
don't!" Steve pleaded, his blue eyes so filled with worry that it stole Tony's breath. "You need to take care of Peter, okay? Make sure he's safe."
"Sweet dreams, little guy," he whispered.
There were plenty of men who had endured being held prisoner during the war, and if they could survive it, then so could he.
"Momma? What's wrong?" he'd asked, his own pain temporarily forgotten. "Why are you crying?"
"Which is exactly how he would've wanted it," Steve rasped. "Dr Erskine knew what would happen if HYDRA ever got their hands on his formula, which is why I made sure that they never did. And no one's been able to replicate his work since."
you!" he choked past his tight throat, holding his boy as tightly as he dared. "It's been way too long, buddy. Way too long."
"Are you certain that you do not require assistance, Master Peter?" JARVIS asked.
"How long is this blackout supposed to last anyway?" he asked.
‚ÄúWhat?‚Äù Tony asked, shaking his head as he climbed into the driver‚Äôs seat of the orange Audi.¬† A lot of the time he honestly forgot that Stark Industries was even involved with the development of drugs, much less actually testing them.¬† Howard had created the pharmaceutical research division of Stark Industries at the request of Tony‚Äôs mother, to try and rehabilitate his public image after one of his many blunders.¬† But since Tony wasn‚Äôt really involved with its logistics and Obie hardly ever mentioned it, Tony often forgot it even existed.
Peter thought miserably.
"Pardon me if this seems out of place, Captain," O'Brien started, his voice dripping with false sincerity. "But there have been a few members of my parliament who have raised‚Ä¶ I suppose 'concerns' would be too strong a word, but owing to the lack of a better one let's just go with that, shall we? They have raised‚Ä¶
‚ÄúYeah, you like that, hmm?‚Äù Tony murmured as he reached for the lube.¬† ‚ÄúTrust me.¬† It gets even better.‚Äù
At 4:55pm, Steve says goodbye to Clint and exits the office, arriving on the sublevel to find the Starks taking seats on the visitor‚Äôs bench by the pool.¬† His heart does a little leap as he spots Tony, who‚Äôs dressed in a tight AC/DC t-shirt with the long sleeves bunched at his elbows and a pair of black jeans that somehow make his gorgeously round ass look even perkier.
"Right," said Natasha after a short pause. "Then I guess we'll go see if Sam's gonna make anything for dinner."
Growing up as a closeted gay kid in Brooklyn, Steve had never even dared to dream that he might someday have what he‚Äôd always wanted: A husband who loved him for who he was, and a child he could call his very own.
It was the same old argument they'd had a hundred times, and Peter just didn't feel like getting into it yet again.
"To Riley," the rest said simultaneously before all four of them downed the contents of their glasses. Steve grimaced as the sharp liquor burned its way down his throat, fighting against the urge to cough. He wasn't that much of a drinker, especially of the hard stuff, as Bucky liked to call it, but out of respect for Sam he hadn't protested when Sam had ordered five rounds of what had been Riley's favourite brand of whisky.
Peter," Gwen said again. "I know that you're Spider-Man."
The second thing he noticed was the massive food bag tucked under Steve's arm, one that Tony couldn't help but notice smelled exactly like his absolute favourite dish from his absolute favourite restaurant in the whole entire world.
"Yes," she said, rather shyly. "I was hoping we could go together, do you think your dads will let you?"
"Y-yeah," Peter stuttered. To be perfectly honest, he was far too distracted by Gwen's close proximity and the gorgeous smell of her hair to pay much attention to the stars. Especially since despite the hot chocolate and wearing one of his regular heated Spider-Man suits underneath his clothes, he was starting to get really cold being outside after dark in the middle of March.
"You think your dads will let you go to the party?" Gwen asked once Liz and Betty had left.
okay!" Tony snapped. "There is absolutely nothing about this that is even remotely close to being okay, so don't you dare try and tell me that it is!"
"Project Rebirth," Steve muttered under his breath as he slowly typed it into the search bar, adding in his clearance code when prompted.
"Oh, shit!" cried Cam as missiles and bullets began streaming across the sky like fireworks, the likes of which Steve had never before seen. "Where the hell'd all this come from!"
"All right," he said softly, squeezing Tony's hand. "Thank you, sweetheart. I'm sure Bucky's already told you this too, but I can't tell you how much I appreciate all the work you've put into this."
"I am wondering how what appeared to be an internal conflict within SHIELD managed to escalate enough to require the presence of the Avengers?"
"Pardon me, sir?" JARVIS said. "I'm afraid I didn't quite catch that?"
He managed to doze off three or four more times, eventually being startled awake by a loud
Gwen let out a sigh, brushing her thumb across Peter's knuckles. "Well, I guess it's time to eat now."
if she wasn‚Äôt kidding.¬† Steve is positive that not even his worst childhood beatings could hold a candle to the amount of pain he‚Äôs in three mornings a week at physical therapy, and the high level of soreness that lingers during the rest of the time.
The guy swallowed hard, smiling sheepishly in Pietro's direction.
"Steve, I just want
"Well," Uncle Sam said after a short pause. "Never a dull moment, huh?"
Or, as Steve preferred to say it, all three of them were.
Old and worn, like Peter's favourite stuffed bear that still sat on his bed back at the house. Time had not been very friendly to him.
"Oh God," Steve breathed. "Bucky, I don't know‚ÄîI don't think I can leave him‚ÄîI can't‚Äî
"A sister? But there's nothing in Norse mythology about Thor having a sister?" Peter said.
As soon as Ms Sharon was gone, Peter reached for his tray, peeling back the cover on a container of chocolate pudding and shoving a heaping spoonful into his mouth. Just the day before he'd had to have his central intravenous line replaced in his neck and it was still a bit sore, and he had a feeling that Ms Sharon had specifically asked for an extra treat for his breakfast that morning to help make up for it.
‚ÄúTony,‚Äù Steve says as he shimmies closer.¬† He raises a tentative hand and places it on Tony‚Äôs knee, relieved when Tony doesn‚Äôt jerk away at his touch.
As soon as Gwen clicked off Peter flopped back onto the bed, eyeing the two laptops stacked on his bedside table. He had been debating for most of the day on whether or not to tell Dad about the HYDRA files, trying to decide if it would actually do any good or just make Dad even more stressed. The guilt was eating away at him so badly that it was almost crippling, but Peter knew he had no right to be selfish at the moment.
"Captain, Mr Stark," he said, glancing furtively at his partner who was still waiting for their order. "Gwen told me what's been going on, and I've been following along with some of the senate debates. I just wanted you to know that my family is here if you ever need anything. Even if it's just to pick Peter up from school, all you need to do is ask."
One thing that Steve does know, unequivocally, is that he was not at all prepared for Peter Stark to demonstrate that he‚Äôs the most natural untapped talent Steve‚Äôs ever seen in a potential swimmer.¬† He wasn‚Äôt exaggerating when he told Peter that his butterfly stroke was pretty much flawless, and the thought of getting to mould all of that talent into someone who could easily become the next Melvin Stewart is almost as exciting to Steve as when he realised he might someday become the next Rowdy Gaines.¬† By the time Peter‚Äôs tryout was done, Steve was literally prepared to get down on his knees and beg to be his coach if for some reason either he or his father decided that Steve wasn‚Äôt worthy or something.
"This procedure is going to be divided into two parts," he began. "The first part is the actual serum infusion, which flows into the patient's main muscle groups."
"So." Removing his shoes, Steve shifted on the bed so he was facing Tony, reaching for his left hand. "I never made it out for my run this morning."
"It was ours," said Pietro as he
Tony wasn't sure how much time had passed before Steve finally moved again, his fingers still curled into Tony's hair as Tony dotted his hip and side with kisses.
And not once during their entire conversation did Tony mention Howard Stark, or the fact that he had a son.
‚ÄúI just said I don‚Äôt know, Steve!‚Äù Tony snaps.¬† ‚ÄúAll I do know is that
"That's it, sweetheart," he said as Tony's mouth dropped open, his grip on Steve's fingers tightening. "God, you're so beautiful, I wanna see you come for me!"
"Oh, okay. Thanks, Mr Stark. I'll‚Ä¶ um‚Ä¶ is it okay if I try again tomorrow? Maybe I can catch Peter when he's awake for once?"
by a significant other, he had quickly learned to crave the attention that he got from his incredible boyfriend.
But even though they had resumed a semi-frequent intimate schedule since then, there was one thing that Steve still had yet to experience.¬† One thing that before Tony, he never would‚Äôve even considered.
"Eh, better you than me," said Tony. "Did you need anything else? Your speedster got his new shoes, didn't he?"
"Captain Rogers' heart rate and blood pressure are both quite elevated, sir," answered JARVIS. "As are yours."
"Copy that," said Tony. "Well done, JARVIS."
"It was dumb as hell of you to not tell me," Tony stated. "And especially after Pete specifically asked you to."
Which was
"Hmph. I've always been able to get by."
If this didn't work, then‚Ä¶
‚ÄúNo, sir, it will not,‚Äù said JARVIS.¬† ‚ÄúHowever, I feel I must ask‚Äî‚Äù
‚ÄúYou want me to do it, Steve?‚Äù Peter asked.¬† ‚ÄúYou know I don't mind.‚Äù
‚ÄúSteve, honey, it‚Äôs okay,‚Äù Dad said, over and over as Papa gasped for breath, watching his counterpart race towards the destroyed building on his injured leg, shouting the names of his teammates.¬† ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not real, try and remember, okay?¬† It‚Äôs just an image.¬† None of it‚Äôs real.¬† Not anymore.‚Äù
"Really?" Peter breathed, too exhausted to mount any more excitement than that. "Oh, thank you! Gwen's gonna be so happy!"
Tony let out a contented sigh as Steve settled into the bed next to him, draping his heavy arm across Tony's chest and yanking him closer until there was absolutely no space at all between them. It was quite a bit earlier than they usually went to bed, as Tony was often working in the lab until at least midnight while Steve watched the news and worked on their training and mission plans, but Tony had to admit that he was rather exhausted after dealing with Damage Control all damn day after working through the night the night before, and Steve‚Ä¶ well‚Ä¶ Steve still wasn't sleeping all that great, so any extra that he could get was definitely a good thing.
"Does this information discuss anything regarding the possible extra-atmospheric travel?" Steve blurted out, his heart skittering when Anthony's wide brown eyes locked with his. "I mean, I'm not trying to pressure you or anything‚ÄîI'm just‚ÄîI'm just really curious, and‚Äî"
Otherwise known as just another day at the office.
It was something he would never forget.
"Okay, I'm just gonna pull rank here and go with yes," James said from his seat next to Bruce. "Seeing as how Spider Boy and Flash Boy over there are just about ready to vibrate out of their seats."
For a second or three, Tony was very tempted to lie to his son, something he had sworn he would never, ever do.
"Yes, yes, I was just getting to that, Mr Stark," Davis retorted, shooting Tony a scowl that if looks could have killed, would've splattered him all over their table. "So, if you don't mind, Captain, can you please give us just a brief synopsis as to what happened after you and Colonel Rhodes recovered the Starks in Afghanistan?"
"Uh huh, Papa. Love you guys."
"Hey, Captain!" Sharon replied, shooting Steve a quick smile. "It's always good to see you. How's it going over there on the flight deck?"
"Peter!" yelled Papa. "Oh God, Tony, you've gotta‚Äî!"
He was cut off by Gwen's fingers brushing across his lips. "I know," she whispered. "I just wanted to tell you good luck, and to be careful. Please?"
"The next pitch will decide the game," finished Bucky. He turned to Steve, giving him a rather sly wink. "Just like that one game that we watched‚Ä¶ what year was it?"
"And can you also please make sure the heat is turned up in Peter's room?" Steve added. "It needs to be at least twenty-eight degrees in there when we get there."
The procedure itself had been excruciating; his entire body feeling like it was getting forcibly stretched while being blasted with enough intense radiation to make the Battle of the Continents look like a house party. But once it was over, and he had emerged from the test capsule almost a foot taller and a hundred pounds heavier, Steve was convinced that it'd been worth it.
As evenings go, it wasn't too bad. After finishing his homework and helping Uncle Sam make a massive pot of his nana's famous gumbo, the four of them settled onto the couches in the living room to watch The Last Jedi, which Uncle Bucky especially loved. Since he had seen it multiple times before, Peter ended up only paying half attention, preferring to focus on his papa's strong heartbeat beneath his ear and how cute Uncle Sam and Uncle Bucky were all cuddled up on the opposite couch.
"Tony," Steve said. "His name is Tony."
"Well, at the risk of sounding patronising, Pete's always been able to see right through anyone," said Tony. "I'm pretty sure those eyes of his are magical or something, because he can detect someone's bullshit from further away than I can even see."
Gwen gave him
Only Steve hadn't thought he'd meant it literally. At the rate Tony was going, though, soon enough he was going to have enough suits to not only fit around the world, but stretch out to the moon as well.
"And you know that I'm not gonna do anything to hurt you," Steve gently retorted. He settled between Tony's legs, hiking Tony's knees up to his chest. "And the next time we do this," he said as he slicked up his fingers. "I'm gonna use my tongue as well."
Smiling so wide that his cheeks hurt, Peter replaced the phone on his bedside table and clutched his polar bear to his chest as a wave of sensation washed across him, remembering the feel of Gwen's tiny hand in his own, and the way she had hugged him as they said goodnight.
"Copy that!"
After saying a quick goodbye to Sarah, who promised to watch over Peter like a hawk, they were off, riding back to the base on Steve's motorcycle in a daze of fear and sorrow. Since he and Steve had already eaten dinner‚Äîif you could call picking at a plate of food for thirty minutes actually eating‚Äîthey headed directly for their dark barracks room, with Steve making a beeline for the record player before the door had even closed.
"Yeah, see ya," Peter said as he climbed into the truck's backseat, slumping into the plush leather chair with a sigh.
And Steve‚Äôs not only stunned.¬† Based on how he‚Äôs favouring his left arm, he is also in terrible, terrible pain.
"That you explain to me how you acquired your knowledge of the stone's location," said T'Challa.
Because as much as Phillips likes to tell Steve that this is just another race at just another meet, deep down Steve knows that it‚Äôs not.
"Good. That‚Äôs... that‚Äôs good.‚Äù Steve squeezed his eyes closed, grunting against the pain as he sucked in a deep, shaky breath. His mind was still racing at MACH-2 as he tried to process what had just happened. The mission had seemed to have been a complete success. All three of the aircraft had functioned perfectly, he, Bucky, and Carol had all fallen into their orbits and deployed their satellites without incident, and JARVIS had made sure that Steve met his go/no-go point with no issues at all.
"No, I don't think he would," said Steve. "Or at least, not yet. One, it's not safe to ask something like that right now because we can never be sure of who's listening, and two, it's not appropriate of me to put Colonel Phillips in a position where he'd likely have to disobey direct orders given to him by his own superior officers. He's done so much for us, Tony, I'm not going to do anything that might compromise his position."
"I don't think that'll be necessary, little guy," said Papa as he pulled into the Tower garage. "Gwen is a nice girl, and I'm sure the two of you will have a good time. Dad and I just want to make sure that you're both safe."
"Let's just get going, shall we?"
"Understood," Colonel Phillips said quietly. "Then get your ass up in the air."
Tony started. He honestly hadn't given even a speck of thought to his choice of words when he'd said that. He'd only said what felt natural.
"Well‚Ä¶ all right," Hill said after a short pause. "Prince T'Challa is waiting for you guys over in the mobile offices that we've got set up, but I'd advise you to keep your meeting brief, and to the point. He's got quite a bit on his mind at the moment."
Peter thought, his dazed mind barely able to wrap around exactly what Dr Strange was proposing.
"Hey, Steve," Natasha said as she came into the lab, her eyes flicking briefly to his unkempt whiskers.
Tony felt his blood pressure spike.¬† This was exactly what Obie wanted, to get him all riled up until he just agreed with whatever Obie was tantruming about.
"Nah, I don't think they know how to quit whining," said Sam. "It's like physically ingrained in them now."
"You are going to have to go against your natural visual instincts here, sir," JARVIS said. "In fact, it would actually be best to blink as little as possible when using this interface."
Tony leaned forward, tossing an almost imperceptible wink in Steve's direction. "It was actually the other way around, Senator," he said. "Mr Fury was kind enough to negotiate on my behalf with the Armed Services Committee when the request was made for me to head up the agency. The committee wanted a civilian, and obviously someone with the means to get the job done as quickly and as thoroughly as possible."
"He killed Loki first," Bruce choked out. "Strangled him with one hand. I‚Äîor should I say, the other guy‚Äîwas barely conscious at the time."
"Ah, Pete," he managed past his tight throat. "You just look so grown up!"
"What, baseball?" asked Peter.
"Well‚Ä¶ I got to know him pretty well. He's pretty sick, poor kid, but he's just‚Ä¶ anyway. I don't know if you've noticed but they work Tony pretty hard here, so he wasn't able to get out early enough to be able to visit Peter before curfew, and Peter was pretty sad about it, so‚Äî" He paused, taking another bite of the sandwich. Sometimes he had a tendency to include too many details.
"I'm fine, sweetheart," Steve said. "And for God's sake, you don't need to be worrying about me." He gave Tony's hand a gentle squeeze, the hand he'd barely let go of in the three or so days since the battle. "I'm not the one who's‚Äîwho‚Äî"
