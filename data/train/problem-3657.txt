Sam was right, they write their own stories now. And a story without Cas was not one Dean ever planned to write. He got to his feet, overcome with a sudden wave of motivation. “Sorry, Cas. Nap time’s over.” He said, looking at the name carved into the table as permanently as it was carved into his soul. “I’m gonna bring you home.”
. He loved his brother with everything he had and they had been through so much together, and maybe it used to be enough but...not anymore. He and Sam were like the foundations of a house, and the others they had lost were the decoration; they might have stopped it from crumbling and given it shape, but… it was the people around them that provided beauty and comfort. It was their family who made the house worth living in. “Finally free.” Dean said, and it was true. They were free, but at what cost? They had lost everyone. Just because they were out of the prison, that didn’t mean the world outside would be habitable. In fact, in that moment, Dean thought his comfy prison cell looked like a much nicer place to be than whatever lay ahead.
An hour later, they were all sat hunched around the kitchen table, Max scribbling notes into Sam’s old Star Wars notebook like he was recording the word of God as it was being spoken. Dean chuckled to himself at the thought; the second most powerful witch of all time grovelling at Chuck’s feet as he recounted what he was planning to put in his review of the Game of Thrones finale on IMDB.
He turned his focus back to the conversation at hand before he started feeling miserable again. “I'll take care of that. What else?”
“Is that…” Dean said, the fog in his head already clearing at the smell that now wafted through the bunker like a damned gift from Heaven. Not that Heaven had ever even sent him a birthday card of course, let alone
losing him again, but it was necessary. All Dean could do now was get himself together and bring Cas the fuck back.
They'd battled leviathans in purgatory, fought literal and metaphorical demons every single day, fallen out and lost each other more times than Sam could even recall...and they had always found their back to one another. They were connected in more ways than even they knew, but Sam saw it. He saw how broken they both were when the other was lost; he saw how unconditionally protective they were of one another; he saw the way they laughed together and the stolen glances. And he saw how frequently they fought over silly and serious things, because of how much they
Eileen took his hand and placed it between both of her own. “It’s only been…” she checked her watch, “seven minutes, Sam. He’s fine.”
“Alright, well… let me help you clean this mess up-” he said, when his phone rang. He picked it up, and his eyes lit up at the screen. “Dean, it’s… it’s Eileen. She’s okay.”
He sighed and paused for a moment, looking at them all pleadingly. When no one backed down, he finally gave in. “Well, what are you waiting for? Tell me about this plan of yours that I’m almost certain is gonna get us dead, or worse.”
“He prayed? That doesn’t sound like any kind of spell I’ve ever heard of.” She thought for a moment, the gears in her head whirring almost audibly. “You know, an ex of mine occasionally dabbled in spells. Mostly the home-based, kitchen kind of magic, but she knew a bit about darker magic, too.”
“You know you never failed me, right Cas? I know you thought you did.” He swallowed against the lump in his throat, fighting against the memories surfacing in his mind.
Dean thought he might have understood then, why Jack had to leave. He wasn’t bound to their story anymore. The one that Chuck had laid out. He was his own story now; his own author. He might be God now, or Amara or whatever. But above all he was still just...Jack. And he was, as Kelly had told him once,
He traced his finger over the newly carved names he had scratched onto the table during his drunken stupor.
“Look, guys. I’m sorry about your friend, I really am.” He gave Dean a sympathetic smile that made him wince. “But I don’t know what this...
He remembered walking this same route with Bobby what seemed like a million years ago, still ignorant to the existence of the celestial beings that had come to be such a huge part of their story. It was hard to believe there was once a time he didn’t even know who Cas was.
Dean moved over to Sam and put a comforting hand on his shoulder, both of them staring at the last dissipating tendrils of light in the space where Jack had been; now empty. “See you, Jack.”
There was very little light in here and his eyes burned as he struck the match. He dropped it into the bowl and watched, silently, as the tape began to melt and the herbs turned to ash. The smell made his eyes water; a wisp of smoke arose from the bowl and unfurled around his head. “Cas…”
Max’s words stirred something in Dean. Something that he had spent far too many hours thinking about.
“Cas, he...he wasn’t perfect, you know.” Sam began. “He made mistakes, we all did. But he died doing the one thing he knew how to do flawlessly… saving you.” Dean swallowed against the lump in his throat; his whole body starting to shake. “And I know he would do it again. And again, and again. I just know that wherever he is, he’s happy. He’s at peace because he died protecting you.”
“Hey.” Sam said, sitting next to him on the bed. He ran his eyes over Dean’s face; his clammy skin and haunted eyes, but he didn’t say anything or ask if he was okay, for which Dean was grateful.
“To everyone that we lost along the way.” Dean said, and they each took at swig. Images flashed through Dean’s head of all the people they had lost, because they had dared to care about them; images of Mary and John. Images of Ellen, Jo and Ash. Jessica, Adam, Bobby, Kevin, Charlie, Benny. Hell, even Crowley. And now Cas...again. And then there were the people who hadn’t died but may as well have: Jack, Lisa and Ben. Why couldn’t they just stop
“I’m around. I’ll be in every drop of falling rain, every spec of dust that the wind blows. And in the sand and the rocks and the sea.” He said.
“It sounds like,” Dean said, taking a swig of whiskey and flinching at the burn in his throat, “we’re going to need a little assistance.” Sam dropped his head into his hands. His sigh of exasperation was enough to tell Dean they were thinking the same thing.
. So he read and read until the words stopped looking like words; until the pain in his temples acted as a temporary distraction from the other pain.
He also knew Sam wasn’t going to let him do this on his own and, no matter how much he tried to convince them or himself otherwise, he was grateful for that. Grateful that they were taking just a little bit of the responsibility off of his shoulders, even though he knew intrinsically that this was a task he, ultimately, needed to do alone.
This wasn’t like the last time Cas had gone to the empty; back then, his body had been left behind. There was nothing left of him this time.
how Cas felt about him; in all the little touches and the way he would look at him when he thought he wasn't watching. Dean wondered if, had he been a little more observant, things may have been different. Cas may have still been alive. He could have been sat here with them now, sharing a beer and looking at Dean with his eyes shining. It was right in front of his face. If he had only
Unsurprisingly, that didn’t work either. He was always so...hyperaware, whenever Cas was near. Maybe it was the whole bond thing, or something else, but he couldn’t just pretend Cas was here. There was an ache in his chest that never seemed to ease. He looked up as he spoke, knowing Cas wasn’t up there, but he supposed it was a force of habit. A few stars spied through a small hole in the roof. He fixed his gaze on them, a reminder to himself that a world exists outside of this place.
Max shook his head in disbelief, and Dean was glad he didn’t ask any more questions about the matter. “You guys never fail to surprise me. But...no, I don’t think that could be of any use to us.”
“And those answers will be in each of them. Maybe not today, but someday.” Jack responded. Dean had never heard him sound so sure of anything before. “But, what about… I mean, can you-" his voice caught in his throat.
He filed that question away to ask Cas, and then mentally scolded himself again for being so damned hopeful. He knew it would only hurt more in the long run if he let himself be this optimistic about their plan, but he couldn't help it. Dean hadn't realised how natural everything seemed to feel when Cas was near, until he wasn't. Everything now just felt...out of place. Like losing a limb. In fact, he thought that losing a limb was a pretty good analogy for how it felt to lose Cas - something that is such second nature to you that you take it for granted, and its not until you lose it that you realise how much you rely on it and you start to
“I’m not coming back home.” Jack spoke the words with a kind of self-assured sadness that caused Dean to pause in his tracks. He turned to face the young Nephilim, his expression a mask of confusion. “In a way, I’m already there.”
it more than ever before. The thought that he would never again hear that gruff, blunt voice that softened only for those he loved; the confused little comments that had Dean in literal laughing fits so often; the careless little touches he would leave on Dean's shoulder or arm or side, like he needed the constant little reminders that he was real. He wished he had appreciated those little things more. The thought that all of that might be lost to him now was
“That’s not what I meant,” Cas said weakly.  He looked at the door, then at Dean, still absurdly holding the pie.  “You should be spending time with your family.”
“It’s enjoyable for me,” Dean said, his tongue loosened by the alcohol. “Just gotta put a bow on you and you’d look like a present.”
Cas elaborated: “You said you’d be good to me.” He hitched on a grin that he’d learned from Dean - confident, amused - even though he felt like neither of those things.
Cas spent the next few weeks in a mess of “meetings, presentations, and misery,” as he referred to it over the phone.
Cas approached and lifted the covers so he could see Dean’s face. “I think you’ve received enough punishment judging by the state of you.”
Despite Cas’s best efforts, Dean was getting under his skin.  He closed his eyes and tried to breathe.  “A conflict of interest implies emotional investment.”  Cas was horrified to feel a lump in his throat.  “And you forfeited that two years ago when you abandoned the FBI to sell state secrets to foreign heiresses.”
Cas finally sighed.  “I don’t know how you’re going to react to this,” he said slowly.  “But I have to tell you something.”
Cas is swirling his eggs around on the plate now, leaving trails behind in the ketchup.  He’s watching his fork with a contemplative frown.  “You put me at ease,” he eventually says.  “When I met you, I was working 14 hours a day, convinced that business was all I was good at.  I didn’t bother with relationships.”  When he looks at Dean, his eyes are warm.  “You reminded me that not everyone is my father, who demanded 110% all the time.”
“Holidays get lonely sometimes,” Cas said honestly.  “Not a big deal.  There are people worse off.  I still have people in my life who care about me.”
, and he realized that despite having just seen Cas two days prior, he’d still been looking forward to seeing Cas again.
There was a rush of cold air that stole Cas’s breath away. Dean was at the open window, letting the cold in. He looked toward the door when Cas came in; his jaw was set. At Cas’s confused squint, he shrugged. “Overheated,” he explained. His robe had been tossed over a chair.
“Thanks,” Cas mumbles as he wipes his face.  When he’s finished blinking away the moisture in his eyes, Cas is finally able to focus on Dean, who’s watching him intently.
It was obvious that Sam was still watching Dean out of the corner of his eye, but he spared a smile and a tummy tickle for Jack. “No harm done, little guy.”
Dean shrugged and slung an arm over the back of couch.  “I missed you,” he said simply.  “So I came back.  Sit down, dude, you’re making me nervous.”
Cas hadn’t said anything when Dean had put it up, too moved to speak, and all Dean had done to acknowledge the moment was to pat Cas once on the shoulder before taking the empty box into the back.
Dean snorted. “Oh, bodily fluids. Keep talking dirty to me.” He shifted onto his side and breathed deeply. His eyes were still closed. “Also, bud, if you’re going to watch me sleep the whole time, you might as well get in the bed.”
Cas cleaned when he was stressed.  It didn’t happen often, but when it did, it always seemed to be because of Dean, something Dean was quietly a little proud of.  Cas wandered into his kitchen and grabbed a rag.  “Charlie Bradbury is a perfectly well-adjusted young woman.”
This conversation was just making Dean feel worse.  He pulled the covers over his head and closed his eyes.  The answer, Dean knew, was
“I’m never hearing the end of that, am I?” Dean said.  His happiness was something alive, vibrating so hard under his skin he was sure Cas felt it through the hands around his face.
Then just as suddenly his brain is back online and all Dean sees is the memory of the tilt of Cas’s chin, the proximity of Cas’s lips, the feverish warmth of his skin as he neared Dean.  The breath leaves Dean’s lungs all at once.
“Let’s stop fighting.”  Something about the sight of Cas and Willow made Dean a little loopy.  The words escaped Dean’s mouth before he’d even properly thought them through, but they were out and Dean couldn’t snatch them back.
He shoved that feeling away and sat up before he started feeling too sorry for himself. He ignored the way the scent of Dean’s laundry detergent clung to him as he left the warmth of the bed, and he definitely ignored the picture on Dean’s desk of the two of them - two years ago, Sammy’s wedding, Dean’s arm around Cas’s shoulders, both of them in suits, both of them mid-laugh - propped up against a framed photo of Mary. He left the room and shut the door firmly behind him.
Dean didn’t move.  He was watching Cas with narrowed eyes.  Cas saw Sam in the car running a hand over his face.
IV.  	When Dean’s tracker tripped the alarms, Cas wished he felt at all surprised.  All he felt instead was the bitter realizations that all of his worst expectations of Dean were fulfilled.  He supposed he’d harbored some misplaced hope that Dean had actually been trying to redeem himself - but then Cas found himself staring at his phone watching Dean’s coordinates change, and there was no way Cas could trick himself any longer.
“Why?” she asked suspiciously, looking between Dean and Cas, both in aprons. “You two need a witness for your wedding or something?”
He watched two young people toss a frisbee back and forth between themselves for a few minutes and tried to remember when it was last that he and Cas did something by themselves - just two best friends spending time together.  It must have been at Sam’s wedding, or in Sam’s backyard playing with Willow.  Every interaction after that had been with other people.  With Daphne.  He wondered if he and Cas would ever spend time together again, the way they used to.
Dean wanted this wet dream to end. He already had a cushion over his lap. “We can fix it tomorrow,” he suggested. His voice cracked a little.
A familiar voice called out from behind Dean.  Cas.  Good.  He’d be able to see Dean’s success.  Cas’s arm went around his middle.  Inexplicably, Dean felt a little better.
“Willow?” Aaron asked, brow furrowing.  Dean didn’t really want to explain any more, but at least Aaron was getting up so that Dean could shuffle out of the booth.
“Can we see Santa at the mall, dad?” Jack asked, tongue between his teeth as he scribbled with his crayon.
Dean’s lounging, one hand behind his head, watching the progress of Cas’s lips down his chest with lidded eyes.  “Wouldn’t love you if you did.”
Cas’s hands bury themselves in the front of Dean’s sweater, fingers deep in the plush wool, trying to haul himself even closer to Dean than he already is. Their lips barely separate as they stumble toward the door, where Dean’s back hits the wood with a soft thud.  Cas hears Dean grunt softly in pain, so Cas does all he can think of to soothe the ache: kiss harder, a little filthier. It seems to work because the next sound Dean makes is a satisfied groan.
What Cas saw in Dean, on the other hand, Dean had no idea. He didn’t ask, content not to look a gift horse in the mouth, and simply tried his best not to scare Cas away.
It’s this revelation that makes Cas push himself away from Dean, just a few inches, just enough space to get both of them thinking again. It’s still difficult to think, however, when Dean’s lips are shining and the breaths he’s taking are still harsh and loud against the silence of a house in winter.
Dean pressed his lips together.  His nose was pink and his eyes were glossy, and when he spoke, his voice was hoarse.  “Thanks, Cas.”
Cas was similarly content, and they enjoyed each other’s company in silence for a few minutes as they began their meal. At a nearby jungle gym, children threw snowballs at each other from the little flakes of ice they’d been able to scrape together. Dean tried not to watch them too closely - you could never be too careful - but Cas observed them with a furrowed brow.
It was a rhetorical question, but Dean answered anyway, though he had his elbows on his knees and his head hanging. “Maybe when I don’t want to throw up every time I move.” His spine was a long line of bare skin that dared Cas to come closer.
Cas nodded. He was smiling for some reason, though that couldn’t possibly be right, because this was obviously the worst idea ever.
Cas opened the front door.  A few yards away, Dean was leaning against his car, one hand holding the phone to his ear, the other thrust into his jeans pocket.  “No,” Cas said, “because I know that’s a lie.”
The doorbell rang.  Cas let Bobby in, and after a quick exchange of greetings, started on his way out the door.  He couldn’t resist, however, throwing one last remark at Dean over his shoulder: “I met him online, if you must know.”
“But something else happened last night,” Dean said, narrowing his eyes. He leaned in to peer at Cas’s face. “What did I do?”
Dean was appeased. He tossed the stress ball once again and caught it, a satisfied half-grin on his face. “Hey, Cas. Thanks for coming.”
Dean’s instinct was to laugh it off, but he stifled it, letting Cas have his moment of sincerity even if it made Dean’s skin itch with embarrassment.
“You are the best man I’ve ever known, Dean Winchester,” Cas said fiercely. “Bakery or not, GED or not, you are generous and kind and giving, and I am lucky to have met you. You deserve the world.”
Cas had turned to watch Dean - because he could now.  “He knows.  I was on the phone with him when you knocked.”
His doctor had strongly advised Cas to go home and rest rather than return to the office.  Cas had thanked him for the suggestion but refused; Cas needed to know what the hell kind of game Dean and Bobby had been playing for the past few years.  Bobby hadn’t answered his phone, and Cas hadn’t had the nerve to call Dean.  Even if he had called Dean, Cas thought, would Dean even answer?  What could they even
Cas stared at the offering.  He didn’t take it.  “I don’t want to disappoint you if it doesn’t work out,” he said.
Dean had his hand cradling Cas’s face, and Cas still had to ask.  Dean skated a thumb over Cas’s bottom lip.  “Yeah, genius.”
But then Cas was lifting his head and there was a hand grasping Dean’s dick through his boxers and Dean thought
Dean was about to reply with a not-so-polite response, but then Cas reached forward and ran a hand through Dean’s hair, just once.
“Good thing I agree,” Dean said, curving his hand around Cas’s cheek and blushing when Cas turned his face to kiss his palm, watching Dean’s face the whole time.  Dean’s throat went dry; he licked his lips.  He was disappointed when Cas closed his eyes and stifled a yawn.
The first kiss was soft - just a warm, tentative press of the lips - but the second quickly followed, which turned into the third into the fourth into the fifth. In between kisses, catching their breath, studying each other’s faces from up close, Cas saw the disbelief in Dean’s expression, so Cas just kissed him harder, hauling Dean closer by the shirt. It must have worked in convincing him, because the next time Cas pulled away to see Dean’s reaction, it was spit-slick lips and lust-blown eyes.
Dean’s eyebrows were furrowed, but not in frustration - in determination. “What if I told you I don’t care?” he repeated, more strongly.
The scene that greeted Cas when he opened the door was about what he expected when he got a sheepish call from Jo earlier that morning telling him that Dean had overindulged at their Christmas party: Dean as a sad, immobile lump under the bedcovers, and only his hair - unwashed, disheveled - peeking out. The sweater and pants on the floor implied to Cas that Dean had shed the rest of his clothes at some point.
Cas’s hair isn’t behaving.  He opens his bathroom door and shouts down the hallway.  “You don’t care what your coworkers think anyway!”
They were in the Impala ten minutes later. It was twenty minutes after that when Claire began getting suspicious. “I know I’m not from here, but I know this isn’t the way to the courthouse.”
Up close, Dean could see the downturn of Cas’s lips. “Just thinking about the future,” Cas said eventually. When he turned to Dean, he was smiling woodenly.
“Uh… you sure you want to know?”  Dean’s plan to help Charlie was already in full swing, but after getting Cas’s friendship back, he didn’t want to risk losing it again so soon.  Or ever, Dean amended.
Cas kissed him. It tasted like salt, and Dean was still crying, and honestly he had no idea what was happening, but Cas was patient with him, kissing his cheek when Dean did nothing but stare.
Two minutes later, Cas is buttoning up his shirt and grabbing his keys from his counter.  Dean’s on his phone in the foyer, looking unfairly handsome in a maroon sweater and jeans.
Dean didn’t even deny it.  He nodded and didn’t bother to stifle the tremble of his smile.   “I thought you were going to tell me you were back together with Daphne.”
“Your friendship has given me a lot of comfort over the years, Dean,” Cas said slowly, looking at his coffee cup.  “I imagine it’s the same with any of your friends.”
Dean bit down on a reflexive smile. “It’s one little thing, alright? Santa’s like - 1% of the kid experience. They’ve got the other 99% to think about - cooler, more important shit.”
Charlie hit him another time, this time with a fist.  “I literally told you the first time we met that Emma Watson was sexy.”
There was a key in Cas’s pocket that Dean had expected him to use “just because,” and Cas had only used it when he had no other choice. Cas had been so careful with Dean, and he’d been proud of himself for that, but maybe he’d been too careful. Maybe
Charlie, who had been taking a long draft of beer - Dean had taught her how to drink - spat it all back out.  It sank into the plush carpet under her coffee table, staining it.  Dean pulled his legs away from the spill, but Charlie seemed unmoved.  She was staring at Dean like he’d grown a third eyebrow in the middle of his forehead and it was crawling to join up with the others.  She seemed both terrified and mortified.  After a long pause, she finally managed to say, very mildly considering her expression, “
“No,” Dean stuttered.  His hands scrambled to pull Cas closer.  “Jeez, no - I’m just - I didn’t - I never imagined - this is
Dean’s mouth went dry. He shoved past Cas before his addled brain got him in trouble. “I’m exhausted, dude. Can we do this in the morning?”
“Save it,” Dean muttered, shoving through the door.  “I’m not gonna force mom to deal with my bad mood, so don’t put me in one.”
They were alone in the elevator, waiting to be brought back down to their floor after being out in the field following a lead.  Cas didn’t look at Dean.  He looked at the lights above the door but before long Dean’s bristling pulled a reply out of Cas: “Dictating what you do is literally my job right now.  I don’t know if you remember but -”
Cas rolled his eyes.  “Probably something to do with standing for three hours in the middle of winter to pick up some subpar pie for my houseguest.”
While Dean watches, Cas transforms into an abandoned marionnette: uncanny and ethereally still.  Dean touches his thumb to each of the fingers of his right hand before he loses the thread of the dream.  The vision of an empty bed threatens to pull him away.
Still, despite the temperature, the occasion was picture-perfect.  An absurdly large fountain bubbled away somewhere behind Dean, and some of the guests were taking pictures in front of the tulip display a ways to his left.  Also, Dean thought, smothering a self-congratulatory grin in his champagne flute, there was free alcohol.  He was in such a good mood that for once he wasn’t even tempted to complain about the drink’s tiny serving.
“For Christmas?”  Dean was in a green sweater.  He looked far too good for Cas’s mental health.  “I know I don’t do Christmas, but don’t people usually do like - turkey?  Pot roast?”
Sam gave a long-suffering sigh.  “Stop.  She’s not pregnant.  At least I don’t think so.  No, we’re - we’re getting a dog.”
When they rounded the corner, they found Sam measuring out dog food into a bowl.  Eileen joined him to pick up Willow where the puppy had been sitting patiently.
Cas doesn’t acknowledge it but he turns to get the onion anyhow.  He can feel Dean’s eyes on him as he reaches for the bowl behind Dean. Cas is close enough to smell Dean’s aftershave and almost crazy enough to lean in closer. He doesn’t, though he desperately wants to. Cas can feel a blush blooming on his cheeks but he avoids Dean’s eyes and turns away, onion in hand.
clingy.  The friendship had started out great: Aaron was fun to talk to, great to watch the game with, and didn’t complain about Dean’s music.  But then Aaron had started calling
Dean doesn’t answer.  He’s watching Cas squirt ketchup onto his eggs, and he’s not even grossed out.  All he feels here is peace, and apparently that extends to Dream Cas’s questionable taste in food.
Dean’s mouth twitches upward, though his eyes remain closed. “You couldn’t pay me to leave after that, Cas.”
“Oh,” Cas whispered again. He saw the briefest glimpse of mirth in Dean’s eyes before he closed his eyes and met Dean in the middle.
“So what is it?” Charlie said into his shoulder.  “Am I not woman enough for you?  Too nerdy?  What?”
Dean’s smile is slow to grow.  He’s still stunned that this force of a man who spent his nights in Dean’s dreams will spend every night from now on in Dean’s bed as well.
“Of course,” Cas said, looking at least slightly abashed. “I just didn’t think you’d take the time to read his poetry.”
that would stop this conversation, because if what Dean was suspecting was true, Aaron was about to talk about
Shame and hurt blocked up Cas’s vocal chords. He cleared his throat and said to the pile of dishes in front of him, “If I’ve misread things, please forget I said anything.” The thought that he might have ruined their friendship on an impulse was making Cas’s eyes sting. He waited in terrified silence.
Dean was about to make a dry remark about Cas’s sass, but then Cas’s hand was in Dean’s boxers and suddenly Cas’s sass didn’t matter.
Cas knew he’d regret talking so much, but he also knew he’d be able to blame it on the alcohol in the morning, so he looked Dean in the eye and said, “So easy.”
Dean let him go and got into bed, marveling at how much had changed over a few hours. When he’d left the bed this morning, he’d thought it’d be the last time.
“Dean, please do not tell me you’re still going to subject Charlie to your experiments.  Have you told her about Aaron?”
Cas’s heart is in his throat. He opens his mouth to speak, and Dean’s thumb follows his bottom lip. He forgets his words.
“You don’t care...about sex,” Cas said, watching Dean’s expression carefully. “Is that what you’re saying?”
“You ever going to tell him?” Sam asked one day as he and Dean watched Cas carry Jack around Sam’s garden. Jack was a grabby kid, and Cas was constantly having to stop him from putting flowers in his mouth.
Dean’s frustration with himself came out forcefully: “It’s you, alright?” Then, more quietly, “It’s you.”
Cas took it, smiling. He looked good post-makeout, Dean noted. Pink cheeks, messy hair, wide smile. How could he have waited five years to see it?
“Listen, Cas,” Dean said, his face angled to the floor, “I dunno if I’m fucking things up here.” He paused. He took a breath, then another one. “But I just wanted you to know. When I say ‘come over whenever,’ I
Dean massaged a temple and tried to reconcile Charlie’s reaction with the situation.  “So you’re - you’re gonna be okay.”
Dean sighed. “Should I have just sprung it on you? Regular old Tuesday over lasagna or something? ‘Hey, great lasagna - by the way, that book I bought you? The one we analyzed over lunch three months ago? I wrote it. Also that blog we talked about? Mine too. Surprise! How’s your brother?’”
When Aaron made his way over to them, Dean was almost glad, though he was a little irritated to see that Charlie hadn’t followed.
Dean set his expression, grit his teeth together so hard he knew he’d hear it from his dentist.  He nodded.  He waited for the
Eventually, slowly, he gets up.  His limbs are heavy but he breathes through the task.  When he’s on his feet, he stares at his hands, blurring at the edges and fighting to fall back to his sides.  He clenches and unclenches them to ground himself.
Cas swallows. The towel in his hand is crushed by his nervous fist. “My offer still stands,” he says. “My home is always open to you.”
While they settled the bill, silence fell. Cas couldn’t read Dean’s expression nor could he think of anything to say, so he didn’t bother with small talk. Eventually, Dean took a long drink of water then raised his eyebrows.
Cas watched the tremble of Dean’s eyelids, admired the strong mechanic’s hands, tried not to imagine how they might feel in his own hair instead.
The neighbors to the right of Dean and Cas’s apartment always got up obnoxiously early, and Dean and Cas were never particularly happy to wake up on a weekend morning to the sounds of their vacuuming and petty bickering. That being said, when Dean walked out of his bedroom the morning after putting the lights on the tree, he was grateful to his neighbors for the first time ever - because the barest strains of some vaguely familiar Christmas carol was being carried through the wall, and that, coupled with the sight of Cas asleep on the couch and the fragrance of Christmas in the air, made Dean’s entire month.
Cas heaved Dean up a little more securely against his side.  “Charlie and I met a few minutes ago,” Cas said, then to Charlie, with a deep sigh that Dean felt all along his side, “Dean is regrettably my best friend.  He is also regrettably drunk.  I am so sorry.”
Dean was sprawled out at the bottom of a flight of carpeted stairs, breathing hard and clutching his shoulder after being pushed down the stairs by a former “colleague” from his felon days.  That “colleague” was now in custody, and his eventual conviction would made six cases closed with Dean’s help.
Cas fidgeted a little bit, but he answered Dean steadily.  “Just for a week or two.  Maybe more.  Don’t know where I’m headed yet.  Just needed to… get away for a little bit.”
Cas had been caught up watching the slow rise and fall of Dean’s chest; he jumped when he heard Dean speak. He took a few seconds to stammer, “I - like I said, you’d be stewing in your own fluids if I weren’t here.”
He grinned in greeting at Cas. “Hey,” he said. He looked at Cas’s outfit, rumpled after a day at the desk. “Gotta say, I prefer you in an apron.”
Dean received a message from Charlie in the early evening on Thursday, four days after Cas left.  He was already dressed for bed despite it barely being 8pm when his phone lit up and buzzed on his nightside table.
Cas had to keep himself from sighing.  He’d gotten a mild case of pneumonia last year and had spent a total of 8 hours in the hospital as a precaution.  He’d barely missed work, and he rarely spared a thought for it.  Dean, however, rarely let a month pass without a snippy remark about it.
“You move on, Sam! There’s nothing stopping you from packing up your shit and going somewhere far away from here with Eileen. I’m sure as Hell not gonna stop you.” He was yelling now, pacing about the room like a caged animal, but he didn’t care. “Jack got Cas out of the empty before; Nick managed to wake up Lucifer. The empty isn’t this inescapable fourth dimension we once thought it was. I know there’s a way out, and I’m gonna find it.”
"Cas is..." Dean gulped, his voice shaky and slightly hoarse. Sam almost cried looking at him, then. He was like a one-man ship on the ocean that had just watched the last lighthouse, its last guide, blink out into darkness. Stranded, lost and utterly, irrevocably alone. Sam placed a hand on his arm in an attempt to anchor him, but it didn't seem to help much.
Which is why he wasn't even remotely surprised when Max had mentioned that Dean and Cas are bonded in more than an Earthly sense.
“Should have known you’d play hard to get. You never have made things easy for me, have you? Like...ever.” He smiled to himself as he tried to imagine that Cas was right next to him.
you to help me get him back.” Dean said, the desperation in his voice seeping through before he could stop it; like sand through fingertips. He figured Max would at least try, considering he had driven all this way to come here.
Dean tried to rid his head of these thoughts, knowing they were pointless to dwell on. Even if Chuck had planned their story eons ago, Sam was right. That was in the past; they were free. Their bad luck had been forecast for years, possibly millennia, but that was over now. Cas had died as a result of Chuck’s ending, but there was no goddamn book or plan anywhere now, that said he had to
It was the same vague explanation he had given to Sam and Jack. He wasn’t quite sure why he was so reluctant to tell them what had really happened. He didn’t feel ashamed or anything, it was more like...if he said it out loud, then it would be real. He would have to acknowledge and process exactly what Cas had told him before he was taken, and he wasn’t sure he was ready to do that just yet.
So, naturally, it was the perfect choice for the spell. He just hoped Cas would forgive him when he found out he needed to destroy the tape to do it. Maybe he’d make him another one, with even more songs. A variety of artists, this time; some Van Halen, AC/DC, Elvis…
“Of course.” He said, and Dean gave him a dismissive nod before heading to his room without another word. He knew Sam wasn’t as hopeful as he was, but he loved him for pretending. They had been searching for about two weeks and still, nothing. Not a damn thing.
“It just feels like we’re going in circles.” He said, taking the steaming cup of hot chocolate from her hand and taking a sip. It was near-scalding, but delicious. It sort of tasted like the kind Ellen used to make for him and Sam when they were younger.
Max nodded and checked it off the list. “We’ll need a piece of him. Like a hair or a piece of flesh.”
He couldn’t bring himself to finish; ashamed at the pure misery in his voice. But Jack smiled, and seemed to understand.
to do this without you.” He couldn’t have fought the tear that slid down his cheek. “Come back to me,
do that. If nothing else, he owed it to Cas. When they got him back, he would make sure to give him a
. He’d give up hunting in a heartbeat if it meant keeping her safe. He knew what she would have to say if he ever decided to speak that thought out loud.
He gulped, looking at Eileen and his brother. Sam gave him a smile that was supposed to look reassuring, but really he just ended up looking like a constipated mongoose. Eileen gave him a genuine smile and a thumbs up, which only made him feel more uneasy. His high hopes from earlier had faded a little; there was still far too much guesswork involved in this plan.
He dropped the small cut of tape into the bowl and mixed, just as Max had said. One turn clockwise, two turns anticlockwise. It was strangely therapeutic. The world around him fell into silence, even the wind was holding its breath.
He awoke in a cold sweat to the sound of someone knocking. He took a few moments to steady his breathing and calm his shaking hands before inviting his brother in. Checking the clock beside him, he gauged he had been passed out for about 12 hours.
When the door opened, the first thing to hit him was the smell; old hay and a decades worth of rat poop. “Jesus, Cas. Why couldn’t you have popped up in a spa or something?” He muttered to the dark. He took a step inside, and the unsettled dust swarmed him immediately, making him cough into his elbow.
afraid. But at the same time...not. Like he somehow knew that Cas wasn’t going to hurt him. Like how you know you’re breathing, even though you’re not consciously aware of it all the time. But he would never, not in a million years, have guessed that this juiced-up crazy dude with the grimy trenchcoat and a stick up his ass would become one of the most important people in his life. And he
Dean dropped the glass, letting it smash into pieces against the hard-wood floor. “I told you what happened, Sam. He summoned the empty to save me. It took Billie, and it took Cas.” He was relieved when Sam seemed to drop the subject.
It was just as derelict and broken as he remembered, but much more sinister. Whether that was from another 12 years of neglect, the night playing tricks on him, or thoughts of what tonight might bring, he wasn’t sure. It’s dying walls crumbled under the pale moonlight as he approached ever closer.
Sam watched him for a moment before replying. “Dean, did…” Dean looked up at his brother, already knowing what he was going to ask. “Did something else happen between you two? When he died, I mean. I get the feeling you aren’t telling me everything.”
go running in like crazy people with nothing more than Eileen's knife and Max's (probably still weakened) powers to defend themselves. But Sam only had one thought on his mind:
“It’s a hell of time to bail.” Dean began, “a lot of people are counting on you. A lot of people with questions, and they’re gonna need answers.” He didn’t say what he was really thinking… Sam and I are counting on you. We need answers.
Dean shook his head of these thoughts almost immediately. He knew there was no use thinking about what he could have done differently. Cas' sacrifice saved him. If he hadn't been there to take down Billie, Dean wouldn't even be alive enough to
“You find anything?” Dean asked, surprised at how steady his voice was. Sam shook his head, and his heart sank once again. “I finished the book of Angelic Lore and...nothing.” Dean rubbed the sleep from his eyes and tried (read: failed) to hide the disappointment in his voice as he spoke. “Well that’s another one down at least. Best get back to it.” He stood, but Sam grabbed his forearm before he could leave.
He smiled, taking a swig. “I’ve been alright. It’s been hard since Alicia, but...I’m getting there.” He said, and he thought Max’s words sounded a little... rehearsed. He also didn’t meet their eyes. Dean didn’t press the subject.
“Dean, we need to talk.” He sighed, sitting back down next to his brother. He had a feeling he knew what he was going to say. “There’s nothing to talk about, Sam. I’m not giving up until we find him.”
Dean stood and dropped his empty bottle into the trash, giving them all a cheeky smile as he did so. “Well, what are we waiting for?”
now. Well… I mean, more big scary Hell queen than usual. And you’re the only witch we know who could even begin to match her power.” Dean said. “Please, Max.”
“But I’m coming to you, I won’t risk having you anywhere near my family and friends. Deal?” Dean agreed and recalled the details of the Bunker’s location before they hung up. Max, surprisingly, wasn’t far out, and said he would be with them within the next 12 hours.
A gentle hand on his shoulder startled him from his thoughts, and without thinking he brandished a cheese grater at his attacker. “Woah, steady on there cowboy. It’s just me.” Eileen laughed, taking the grater from his hand before he found a way to end one of their lives with it. She beckoned him over to the kitchen table and sat opposite from him.
at him until those other emotions crawled into the corner to think about what they did. It screamed too loud now and Dean couldn't block it out. He knocked the bowl to the floor and yelled at the sky.
never would have guessed that he’d end up needing this guy like he needed air, or that losing him would hurt more than a rebar in the back.
He walked the last few feet and hesitated, staring at the rusty latch in front of him that looked like it hadn’t been touched in years. He realised there was a chance he would never leave this place once he entered, he could so easily unleash something that might destroy the world. His one solace was the fact that the roof would probably collapse on him before he got to that point, anyway.
They rushed in without hesitation, which, Sam realised after, probably wasn't the smartest idea. Max had just said there was something powerful in there, which is pretty good incentive to
He stood and paced, like a lion in a cage. He ran a hand through his hair and took a shaky breath, trying to calm the anger inside, but the flames were already burning.
“Well, we’ve already sort of got an idea, we just need some help executing it.” Sam spoke. “It’s pretty risky but we figured if anyone would know anything about it, it would be you.”
Dean felt panicky all of a sudden. He wasn’t a witch. He could stab a monster in the head no problem, but magic? Not exactly his area of expertise.
that affectionate. Not with anyone other than Dean, anyway. He was nowhere near as casually-touchy with Sam or even Jack. Dean didn't realise how blind he had been until then. It was so
His hand shook slightly as Sam handed him the bottle, but he played it off as a result of the slight chill in the bunker that evening, though he knew it wasn’t that. It was the deafening silence that had encompassed him since the day before, when Cas had been taken by the empty. A silence that got worse the longer he was in the bunker. He was used to the Angel always being there; his near-inaudible footsteps and voice that had always seemed so otherworldly even when he was human. Cas being gone only seemed to amplify the absence of Jack and Mary, too. Their story had ended the same way it had started; just him and Sam. And yet… it was completely different. There was an emptiness now that hadn’t been there before. Dean wasn’t sure if the feeling was a result of the physical lack of noise, or perhaps a distant echo of whatever the hell was going on inside him. Cas had
“I’m not getting a demon involved in this, Eileen. Or an Angel, for that matter. If I’ve learnt anything these past few years, it’s that things never go as planned when you try to get Heaven or Hell involved.”
. It wasn’t a goodbye, not really. Jack wanted to be something...different. Not gone necessarily, just...different. And he needed to respect that, no matter how much it hurt. Jack stepped towards Sam and pulled him into an embrace. They held tight for a while, and his heart ached for Sam. They had all loved him, but Sam had always been the closest to Jack. Cas may have taught Jack how to live, but Sam had taught him how to be human.
Although that wasn’t a lot of time, really, to Dean it felt longer than the forty years he spent in Hell. The time seemed to consist purely of pacing, staring at walls, and one too many of Eileen’s grilled cheese sandwiches. He tried to sleep, but there were too many thoughts running through his head and he just ended up watching the ceiling for a few hours.
And someone was calling his name but the cry wasn’t one of words - it was more of a sensation. Like thunder that you can't really hear, just feel. A chill that runs deep into your core like acid burning through flesh. The call was one of pain and loneliness. Utter, incomprehensible despair.
Cas searched Dean’s eyes as if he were trying to find any evidence that he might be lying.  He would find nothing, Dean knew.  Cas’s smile was slow to spread, but spread it did until all Dean could see of Cas’s eyes were shining blue half-moons.
Amara looked at Castiel significantly.  “He’ll be escorted to his safehouse at the end of the day unless you need him.  Come see me today when he’s gone.”  She turned on her heel and walked away without a word to Dean.  The junior agents went with her.
Dean’s eyes danced between Cas’s for a moment. Then he cleared his throat and looked away, dropping the hand on Cas’s side. “How’s lunch sound?” His voice was casual.
“Hey, it’s Christmas,” Dean whispered a few hours later - both still on the couch with rumpled sweaters and rucked-up hair.
Dean shrugged.  “You deserved the nap.”  His eyes were half-lidded as he looked at Cas, but his lips were upturned.  And he still hadn’t let go of Cas’s hand.
He went home.  The creaky front step bothered him more than ever, but he couldn’t find it in himself to fix it.  He was still reeling from Cas’s outburst.
“I thought I should tell you before it gets any farther in the proceedings - I’ve started the formal process of adopting Jack.”
out of reach. If he could stretch out his fingers just a little bit more, he’d be able to pull Dean closer and keep him from leaving. Every day the boxes in his living room greet Cas and remind him that despite whatever routine they’ve established, Cas’s apartment is destined to return to its silence.
Once he’s sure the dream won’t slip away from him, Dean indulges some more.  He’s always amazed at how accurately his brain can recreate Cas.  Everything is perfect about his appearance, from the fresh bedhead down to the scar running up Cas’s leg from when he tore open his shin on a hike.
It was amazing to him that he found himself in this moment, that something like this could happen to him, that Dean Winchester was smiling back at him in his apartment, that they were about to move forward together after years of friendship, that this was a thing that he could trust in.
“Nothing would make me happier than to help you open your business,” Cas said. Not one word was a lie.
“How’s Cas?” Charlie asked, effectively popping the bubble of peace that Dean had almost convinced himself was real.
“Of course I will, Cas,” Dean said, because the only thing worse than painfully-attractive-Cas was sad Cas.
Cas was fidgeting with the comforter.  “Dean, you make me… restless.  I’ve never felt this way with anybody before.  Even before I understood my feelings for you, there’s always been this urge to… to touch you.  On your shoulder or your arm.  But lately... other... places.”
choice, because despite knowing Cas would probably be a smug bastard, Cas would also know what to say to make Dean feel at least a little bit better.
Cas closed his eyes.  “I hated you so much only because I… cared for you so much,” he said.  He wanted to say so many other things:
kissing him, but once it sinks in, he is most definitely on board with the development, and he pushes Cas against the wall and starts to thoroughly enjoy himself.
Cas started typing as he answered, determined not to appear affected, even though he could feel his ears getting hot in irritation.
“Please share my bedroom with me.” It took courage, but he said it. “I’ve been in love with you for years.” He touched Dean’s waist. They were still holding hands. “I don’t know how else I can explain it to you.”
They were idling in the Impala outside of Cas’s apartment building.  They had spent the whole evening sitting together in Mary’s backyard while they listened to Sam and Eileen recount their adventures as parents of a young rescue puppy, and Cas had smiled and nodded along, adding smartass comments where appropriate and murmuring inside jokes to Dean where it wasn’t.  It had been like he’d never left, and if it were left to Dean he would have preferred to pretend it was just so, for as long as possible.
Her mouth was grim when she stepped in a little closer to Cas and murmured, “And keep an eye on him.”  She stepped back.  “He has a tracker on his ankle,” she said so that Dean could hear her.  “An alert will be sent out automatically if he tries to leave, but even so agents are checking on it constantly as a precaution.  Alerts will be sent out to a dozen special agents, including you, when he steps outside of any areas outside of the agreement.”
Dean shrugged.  “I’m just - Sammy’s done pretty well, hasn’t he?  Gorgeous wife, decent neighborhood, a goddamn puppy.  Damn.  It’s his dream come true.”
As Dean leans in even more, he sees the confused furrow between Cas’s brow melt away.  Cas’s eyes flutter shut.  He tilts his head up.
Cas drained his tea, gathered up his coat, and joined Dean at the open door. He pressed a warm hand to Dean’s arm in thanks.
“I thought I was going to lose you to some woman and her kids one day,” Dean admitted, letting go of Cas’s hand to clutch his ribs and pull him closer. “Every time we pulled up to a new place, that’s all I could imagine.”
Eileen released Dean, patting his cheek affectionately.  Then she turned to Cas, visibly moved.  “My other big brother,” she greeted, before pressing her face into his collar.  “Hello.”
Cas floundered a little bit for a topic.  And landed on the worst one possible.  “I think he’s sleeping with the director.”
Exasperated, Cas put down the toilet lid and led Dean to sit on it. Dean’s skin was hot to the touch, but it still made Cas shiver. He pulled away before Dean noticed. “Will you be fine, or do you need me to scrub your back?”
Dean’s previously perfect life didn’t seem so perfect anymore, not when Dean could count, off the top of his head,
“How’d you know I’d even stick around?” Dean asked. His breath skated across Cas’s collar. It was warm in the chill of the room.
“No!” Dean said, a little too loudly, then, when Cas kicked him in the small of the back, said more softly, “No.  Stay.”
He was rung up a few short moments later. Afterward he turned and handed the man another copy of the Campbell’s book.
Dean nodded.  He picked up a paper that Cas dropped and admired the sketch on it.  Cas had always been a decent artist, though he never admitted it.  “Damn,” Dean said in admiration.  The character on the paper was dark-haired with freckles scattered across his nose.  He was sitting on a hill with his head tilted up to the sun.  “Who’s this babe?”
Dean woke up warm. Too warm. He opened his eyes - swollen with fatigue - and was met by the sight of someone’s chest rising and falling in a cotton T-shirt. That someone had their arm slung over Dean’s side in a loose embrace. Dean tilted his head up to confirm his suspicions.
But Aaron was holding up a hand.  “Nah, don’t worry about it.  I get it.  New guy.  Meeting the family.  Always gonna be awkward, right?”
was all Charlie replied with.  That was an easy enough request to comply with: since Cas had left, Dean had been steadily working his way through the nearest liquor store and had a few six-packs in the fridge already.
“You wrote ‘Eyes Like the Sky,’” Cas said again, more quietly. He removed the hand over his face and looked at Dean, his eyes wary. They were eyes like the sky.
Cas cut her off before she finished. “We wanted to thank you for your help,” he said, which effectively stopped Claire’s tirade.
“I like you,” Dean continued, as if Cas needed another heart attack.  “And I guess I just think this could go somewhere.”
“I can’t believe I didn’t ask earlier,” Cas said. “We were so caught up talking about the book. I haven’t made you late to work, have I?”
Dean leans against the door jamb and watches.  This is a familiar scene in his life, but here in Dean’s head,
Dean didn’t answer, but there was a minute shake of the head, like he was ashamed to be caught at it.
Dean didn’t answer. It would take a while for Cas to wrap his head around everything, and Dean would wait for as long as Cas needed.
Eileen didn’t bother to help.  She put Willow down.  “Say again?” she said, looking confused.  Her hands came up to sign along with her words like it did when she was flustered.
Dean is half asleep when Cas walks in wearing Dean’s jersey and a pair of sweatpants - then Dean’s suddenly wide-awake and half-hard.
Feeling a little bad about it, Dean tapped the door twice with a shoe.  “Hello?  Can’t use my hands here!”
She stuck her tongue out at him but straightened anyway.  “So how long have you known him?  He cute?”  She wiggled her eyebrows at him suggestively.
Then January 24 came around, and Dean was a year older.  On that day he came out of his room in the morning and sat down at the kitchen table, staring at his phone.  Cas stabbed at the eggs in the frying pan.
It wasn’t really an answer to Cas’s question, but Cas didn’t want to embarrass Dean any further, so he didn’t press. He decided to take the burden on himself instead. He thought back to the night before, to the way Dean had stared at Cas when they were alone, to the earnest way he’d said, “
Dean had assured Cas it was fine - “No harm done; don’t work yourself too hard” - but then he’d ended the call and felt something that he identified as
Cas stood up automatically.  He was caught between two sources of confusion.  “I don’t - sorry, Sam, someone’s at the - “
Cas had knocked on Dean’s door two hours ago, tired but content, looking forward to sharing a part of his life with Dean, but then Dean had thrown this mess at him and hadn’t even had the goodness of heart to stick around and help Cas make sense of it. No wonder Cas had looked so terrified.
Cas let the silence hang between them, hoping Dean would understand without putting words to it.  They’d been best friends for years, had seen each other through new relationships and bad breakups, but lately Dean had been staying later and leaning closer and speaking softer, and after a while Cas had had to accept that maybe the signs he was receiving weren’t just wishful thinking on his part.
Cas approaches and Dean gives him a once-over, his eyes lingering on Cas’s hair.  “The bedhead’s a nice touch,” he says, raising his eyebrows.  His gaze skates over Cas’s lips, then back up to Cas’s eyes.  “Not bad, Cas.”
Cas looked at Dean so tenderly it made Dean’s throat tight. “And I’m so grateful for that, Dean. You’ve been the best support I could have asked for.” Cas looked down, his eyebrows furrowing. The hands at Dean’s elbows tightened. “But I have to ask of you one more thing.”
Conveniently the food was only a few feet to the right from Dean, who was standing at his station by the grill and watching them approach with a spatula poised in the air like he’d forgotten he was holding it. Sam clapped Cas on the back once more before retreating; Cas could have sworn he tiptoed away.
Cas didn’t bother to distill his contempt, though he wasn’t sure if the contempt was aimed at Dean or himself.  “Sit down” was all he said, “And don’t speak unless I address you.”  He opened the first of the folders the director had given him and sat down at his desk.
Cas assumed that Dean would just dodge the question if he asked why his purchasing a house was so objectionable, so he never asked. Calmly and patiently (and not for the first time) he answered,“I’m in good financial shape, and I can afford to start thinking about the future.”
The click of Cas’s throat is audible.  “Your hand’s wet,” Cas says faintly.  His eyes are wide.  His throat bobs.
Dean felt none of those things.  He felt, instead, a sense of horrible hopelessness descending on him, and he suddenly understood one thing very clearly: he’d been arguing against Daphne’s presence in Cas’s life as if he were afraid she might leave him again when, in reality, all he
“You look out the window a lot?” Dean asked, sitting down on the couch he’d known since he was 17.  Cas settled down next to him, though he left a decent amount of distance between them.  Dean patted his shoulder in gratitude; though he thought Mary would be ecstatic for them, he had no real idea how Mary would react.
“Gilda,” he said, a little breathlessly.  She was holding a drink.  It was pink.  There was a sprig of mint floating on top of the ice.  He almost didn’t mind it because it matched the red dress she was wearing.
Cas is the one who has Dean against the door, but Cas’s knees go a little weak when Dean’s smile turns a little wicked.  “Again,” he says, his hands skimming tantalizingly close to the button on Cas’s jeans, “I like the sound of that.”
“This lemon bar tastes just as good as the last one,” Cas said, head in hands. He was stuffed full of pastries already, and it was only 11AM. “Remind me why you can’t taste them yourself?”
“Exactly. Knew you were a sharp one,” Dean said cheerfully. He got out of the car. Cas followed suit. Claire, sending wary looks at them both, got out as well.
that little voice in his head nagged at him. He tried to ignore it, but the thought had been niggling about in his brain since Dean had first told him and Jack that Cas was gone.
He raised his beer to the air, smirking at him before gulping back the last remaining drops. “Hell yeah, I killed Hitler.”
He could remember making it like it was yesterday. They had gotten into a fight about something, he couldn’t remember what, and he had made it for Cas as an apology. He’d never been particularly good with words, and the only way he could think to make things better was through music. It was a way of letting Cas know that he cared without actually having to say it.
Sam’s eyes looked sad, and Dean wondered who he was thinking about at that moment. Maybe all of them, maybe none of them. Maybe he was thinking about Eileen. Dean hoped she was okay. Sam took another sip of his drink. “You know... with Chuck not writing our story anymore, we get to write our own. You know just, you and me, going wherever the story takes us. Just us.”
“How is the research going, Dean?” He liked that she didn’t ask him if he was okay. Partly because Sam had asked him that so much over the past few weeks that it was beginning to feel like a chore to answer it, and partly because he was
“Right, one more thing and then we have the basics down. We’ll need a place to perform the spell; somewhere that’s significant to Cas. This one was a bit trickier to figure out, but I think Nick was able to summon Lucifer because he
Sam and Dean exchanged a glance and it was silently agreed that Sam would be the one to briefly recount the events of the past few years, probably at the risk of Dean sounding insensitive, which he thought was bull, mostly; but Sam did a pretty good job of it. Eileen chipped in a few times, but he stayed quiet until Sam was finished. When he was done, Dean slid Max another well-earned beer across the table, since he hadn’t touched the other one since Sam mentioned that they had ended God which, you know, all things considered, was a pretty tame reaction. “Oh, and I killed Hitler.” He dropped in at the end, just because.
Eileen pursed her lips before taking a small sip of her drink. She hissed slightly as the hot liquid burned her tongue. “How did Nick get Lucifer out of the empty, again?”
This was a thought that had crossed his mind a few times, but he had pushed it away before he let himself consider it. He needed to believe that Max could help them in some way; even if that was just pointing them in the right direction.
Dean looked at the bustling crowds around him; at the young girl riding her bike without a care in the world; at the oblivious old man on the bench reading the daily headlines. The world once again looked like it always had, thanks to Jack. Green and loud and full of life. Yet he couldn’t shake the feeling that something was missing. Something more fundamental than the trees or animals or clouds. This was a world without colour; without warmth and hope and light. This was a world without Castiel. He turned his attention back to Jack, who was looking at him sadly. “Where?”
“That bad, huh?” She stood and walked to the counter, returning a few minutes later with a hot drink for each of them.
And then she’d probably make some rude gesture that would set them both off laughing. And he knew she could, right down to his very core, he knew she could. She could take care of herself better than any hunter he had ever known. More than their dad, more than Bobby. Hell, more than he and Dean ever could for sure. But he also knew, no matter how strong she was or how much she protested, he would never stop trying to protect her. It was an instinct that was as natural and innate to him as breathing.
“I don’t think I have to tell you I’m not exactly thrilled to hear from you, but…” Dean held his breath. “You did help me out before, so I guess I sort of owe you one.
Dean smiled so wide he was worried he might break his face. His hopes were officially on the upside of Heaven now. Sam met his eyes across the table and seemed to read his thoughts. He gave him a look that said
Dean knew immediately what they were all thinking, but it was Sam who spoke it aloud. “Can it be a person?”
The sound of the bunker door opening broke him out of his haze, and he looked up from the book on summoning spells to see her walking towards them, her footsteps almost inaudible compared to his and Sam’s monster stomps. Sam got up from his seat next to Dean and headed her way. He kissed her on the cheek and took the white plastic bag from her hand.
Sam furrowed his brow at him. “What ba-” he began, but his eyes widened before he finished. “Oh...the
He saw the goodness in his face now. He could see himself and Sam in his eyes, and Kelly, and Cas. God, there was so much of Cas in those eyes that it made his heart ache. Perhaps that was why Jack had been so easy to love; he reminded him so much of the people he cared most about. He was all of them, yet none of them. He was just...Jack. And Dean didn’t want to see him go. “I’m me, but...I know what you mean.” Jack spoke, and Dean wasn’t sure he would ever really understand who exactly Jack was. He wasn’t sure he needed to.
Dean opened the door wider so he could enter. “Good to see you too, man.” He shook hands with Sam, who seemed pleased to see him. Eileen introduced herself and gave him a friendly hug, and they all took a seat at the table.
in that bond between them..." Max paused and shook his head, his face a mask of disgust. "I think it made their connection even stronger. And I'll bet Lucifer being an Archangel made it powerful as Hell, too. No pun intended." He nodded at Dean. "There's a reason a lot of witches don't agree with possession; it involves losing a part of oneself to another. Nick
He and Cas both held a piece of each other within them, and that’s as far as he could ever go to express it in words. But now, Max had just done exactly that.
“See, Angels...they don't have souls, as such. But their grace performs essentially the same function. It's what gives an Angel consciousness and it makes them who they are." Dean gave himself a mental pat on the back at his deductive reasoning. Sherlock Holmes is turning in his freaking grave.
“Look, Dean. I know how much Cas meant to you, how much he meant to all of us. But have you considered that there might just… not be a way out for him this time?” Dean stood again, the suppressed rage inside him already starting to make his skin itch.
Eileen’s soft touch on his forearm dragged him back to the present. She smiled over at him, her eyes concerned. “Penny for your thoughts?” She asked.
“Most summoning and resurrection-type spells tend to have a few things in common. Every spell is different of course, but there are a few foundational elements that the majority of them have. Think of them as sort of like...building blocks. Everything that comes on top is just decoration really, specific to each individual spell, but they all need the foundations. And Nick, whether or not he knew what he was doing, had these foundations in place. Which is what makes me think that the spell he did wasn’t all that different from any old summoning spell.”
Jack stepped over to him, then, and he wondered briefly if all that God juice had made him a little taller. Maybe he just seemed it. He didn’t hug him, just put his hand on his shoulder in the place where, just a few hours ago, Cas’ palm had been. His last, bloody, goodbye. “Remember what I said, Dean. Remember it.” And then he stepped back, placing his hand over his heart. “I’m really as close as this.” He looked between them, and spoke for the final time. “Goodbye.” He said. And then he turned, and was gone.
