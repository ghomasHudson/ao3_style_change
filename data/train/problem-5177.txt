He was a good man, and even though they broke up not too long ago, she wanted the best for him. He really does have a golden heart, and she knew that even if they weren't dating she wanted to keep it safe from any harm.
"Oh, I just might- but you, you're not a real SHIELD agent, are you, human? Why would an ordinary, pathetic, human-like you would need MY Scepter?" Loki hissed at him, walking closer to the glass that separated them.
Why was he caring about a hero in the first place? He shouldn't. He's Tony Stark! Iron Man! He's their enemy!
It was hard enough to work for a jerk as your boss, and dealing with life after a break up even without SHIELD and the whole Avengers and Iron Man fiasco. She really didn't have time for this shit.
"You're very smart, Gary. Why aren't you working for something more than analyzing data? You could go places."
"Thank you Pep, but really, I mean it- no. I am not going to work there. Nothing personal, just fucking hate that place. Bye for now, take care."
He was here for the Tesseract, he needed it badly. It could power up all of his suits and more, it could destroy Stane Industries completely. He could be so powerful, unstoppable even.
When they all started arguing inside one of the labs, he realized something crucial- the Tesseract was not here. There was a scepter- Loki's Scepter, just besides Banner. This was so bad.
The party was fun, as much as a Blue and Red themed party for an eight-year-old can be, (Peter insisted that those were his favorite color and that he wanted to
More like, saw him in the distance, just popping around every half an hour or so as Steve rode around on his motorcycle.
"And who might you be, running around with my weapon like that?" the villain asked, more like purred really, his eyes squinting and his grin growing darker by the second.
So yeah, Captain America didn't know who he could trust. He considered the team safe enough, even though they really were on edge. Something's keep feeling… wrong, missing. Like the team wasn't well built, and it really bothered him.
As much as Tony wanted to stay and hear more of the gossip about how awesome and undefeatable he was, he couldn’t take the risk of getting caught with the Scepter in hand, and a Badge not his.
Clint recalled three times which Thor wasn't around to catch him. One of them, the Hulk growled before crashing into him, breaking his nose but sparing him two broken legs.
If Rhodey (a jet pilot in the US Air Force) would have ever been to find out that his friend was the Bogey the Air Force was chasing after for the past couple of months, then Tony will be as good as dead.
Harley, being his eldest son and the only other person to know of him being Iron Man, was his assistant in almost everything that involved the Iron Man suits. He came up with safety protocols, and cool gadgets his father should have in the suit to help him fight and was the number one fan of Iron Man out there- not that there was very much of a competition, with Iron Man being a villain of the Avengers.
"You can have one each, for now. You can pick what you want, and that's it for today- I don't want you getting your tummies full before dinner, got it?" and Peter smiled so brightly at his, Tony could feel himself smile too.
Sorry for the long, long wait... I can't work under pressure of time, so I let my mind float around until I get an idea for the next chapter, and sometimes, like now, it takes some time. But I believe that I'll finish the story soon.
Of course, Steve just couldn't think something without anyone ruining the perfect image he had in his head.
"Do we have anything else on our to-do lists today?" Clint asked sarcastically, and Natasha rolled her eyes.
And Harley would probably giggle at the ironic situation and blow what little cover he had left at this point, so he was glad that his children weren't home right now.
This was getting complicated, because on the one hand- she didn't want to pry too much, she didn't want Tony thinking she was involving herself too much in his life, but on the other hand- she was scared for him, she really was. He wasn't doing well since they broke up, and she didn't know if he had found a solution or got himself into more trouble.
After the party has ended, everyone went back to their home and Peter was fast asleep on his bed, tucked in with his Blue and Red PJ's on under the Blue and Red mattress, Harley and Tony want to the garage- where most of Tony's little inventions were.
But Stane Industries- Stane Industries was a different case. Stane always had a too-tight grin plastered unnaturally on his face, and everything about him screamed 'fake'. Maybe he was just a liar, but Steve thought there was something bigger than that, he just felt it in his gut.
He could at least thank god for Pepper arriving while Harley was out of the house to go pick up Peter from his friend Ned. He couldn't even start to explain to Peter who was Iron Man, and he really didn't want to. What if Peter hated Iron Man, and one day would find the mask just lying around in the house?
Thor grumbled that he 'had to do everything on this planet' whatever he meant by that, before going to the labs to call Bruce.
The real question, the one that bothered everyone- was what exactly the Avengers would do about Iron Man now.
"I know about the file you are referring to. What did you want me to see?" she asked and was handed the copy by Natasha, sitting to her left around a big, round table.
"I'll see you then," Steve said and watched with a hopeful smile of his own as Iron Man flew away, disappearing into the clouds above.
Face palming mentally at his bad luck, because he would have to actually go there now- Gary didn’t have any reason to go and see the Scepter, not all alone with a briefcase just like that.  Tony smiled his best fake smile, and nodded, "yeah, I am. It was so nice to meet you, Dr. Banner; I'm a huge fan of yours. your work on anti-electron collisions is unparalleled. And I'm a huge fan of the way you lose control and turn into an enormous green rage monster." Banner looked a bit overwhelmed.
Loki pointed to a door in the far corner of the room, his face not giving up anything, not one emotion. But if Tony would've looked closer, his eyes gave the story up- he was curious about this human, so confident while in danger that Loki was sure was coming for him.
She knew that a job like this could help him and his kids a lot, because after Harley and Peter's mother died he couldn't really get a stable one. She knew he built and repaired things to escape reality for a bit, to have some rest, and that this was the reason he became a mechanic in the first place- but maybe a good and stable job could help his mental state for the time being.
"Just so you know, Stevie-my-boi," Steve already looked so done with this shit, "that it was actually 42 mini marshmallows. Mama raised no coward."
The elevator to the Avengers common room dinged as she arrived, and Pepper blew out a breath she didn't know how much time she held in.
Iron Man noticed them, of course, but instead of facing them in a proper fight, he flew back, to the other area of the facility, which remained unharmed until this point.
He sent her an 'R U OK?' in return, hoping that this could be delayed until he could pull himself together just enough to look like a human being.
Bruce furrowed his eyebrows. "She has a stressful job; of course she would be freaking out all the time. Who wouldn't?"
"Are you sure, Tony? This is really not a big deal for me, I won’t be in any problem for doing this for you, you know that right?" well, almost no trouble. She might get a few more frowns, but she was the female boss of many sexist men- she could pull this one off.
The Avengers called her in, something about the Iron Man case. This could go pear-shaped rather quickly, and she most certainly couldn't let it be that way.
It was just so hard to stay focused like that- Steve, Captain America, his stupid, silly crush- that could never love him, obviously, the blood-soaked rag in his hand spoke plenty. It was humiliating, even. Not only he was crushing on Captain America (and couldn’t shut his mouth about it near the guy), but he is, most likely, the one and only person on the planet that would never have any chance of getting his feeling returned. The Captain, plain and simple, could never love him back. He was the guy that gave him all the work, all the headaches. He probably wanted to strangle him by hand or shoot his chest a couple of times.
Tony was hiding behind a box on the Helicarrier, trying to hide long enough so the people could go away.
Thankfully, the pissed off spied looked too damn stressful and angry to care about him for the moment.
Right at this moment, Harley was starting on rebuilding an older suit, one that had been severely damaged. He made sure that nothing was too damaged in the suit that Tony used today in the fight with the Avengers, or Earth's Dumbest Fuckers as he secretly called them, all the while Tony was hacking onto some SHIELD and SI servers in order to check for any new plans or surprises they had ready for him.
"Well, I gotta give this back to Fury. He seemed pretty furious back there, right?" he joked, and got the Scepter with a glove he found laying around the room.
They got off the jet in another one of Stane Industries' factory, where Iron Man was already blowing up weapons and tech.
Speaking of which, Harley and Peter just entered the front door- both with stupid smiles on their faces.
Steve shook his head as if it will help getting those awful thoughts out of his head for good. It didn't, of course, so he got up and went to the kitchen.
She was nervous, but you couldn’t tell that on her right now. She needed to look as calm as possible.
Bruce and Thor arrived, and they all settled down while Clint explained how Iron Man saved him two times, and not by an accident.
The Avengers were arguing, but it was basically Fury against all the four of them. Tony didn't know where Hawkeye was, but the Black Widow seemed sad- maybe he was injured? Captured?
Our sneaky boi Tony trying to be a SHIELD agent, and Pepper is figuring out some shit of her own... or is she?
The grin was soon whipped out of his face, because just a moment later the suit's lights came back to life, back on.
"None of your business, Reindeer Games, I'm not here for you." Tony looked around, finding that he could see from where he was standing way too many cameras for his liking.
She did look into Tony's file at SI. It was mostly classified, but she couldn't understand why was it classified to her- she was one of the highest ranks, possibly the higher, short for Stane himself. Why couldn’t she see the file about a random citizen?
Not much was written there- only upgrades that were used in fights, things he said or his obvious fondness towards the Captain were there.
Pepper, of course, knew what he was speaking of. The form, one she emailed them herself, listed many names- and she tried to look into the form, she really did, but she knew he couldn't temper with the names. She wanted desperately to take Tony's name off the very long list of people thee, but she knew SHIELD would track any changes back to her. She couldn't risk herself that way, because she wouldn't be able to help Tony at all if she was in SHIELD's custody.
So sorry for the long wait! I hope you liked the chapter, and if you'd enjoyed, please leave a comment and Kudos! it encourages me to keep on writing!
Vigilante, Terrorist, Villain, Monster, The Merchant of Death- no matter all the nicknames he had, SHIELD was no closer to finding his real one.
He went to the kitchen, and made himself some coffee, even though his fingers itched for something stronger.
You see, the world was shocked when a missile was released at the alien invasion, at New York. And the world simply didn't know how to take it, when a mysterious figure
"Time will tell," came the vague reply, and the man was gone, the door shutting behind him and making an echo inside the room.
Most of these days, he didn't get The Itch, but from time to time, when he was feeling really down in the dumps, he would've wished for a bottle of some good whiskey.
Tony circled the room, almost getting to the door, his head facing the floor the whole time, trying to avoid the cameras. Loki almost smiled at that- Stupid mortals with their stupid problems, such as none-magic magic devices. He sometimes wondered how they could live in a world so naked of any magical artifact, no places to learn true witchcraft. In some way, Loki almost felt sad for them.
Now he was searching for someone… not someone specific, just someone who was similar to him enough so he could steal their badge.
And if one day he would get to know who Iron Man was, it was either after the Avengers would defeat the man, kill him and find out themselves who was the man they cursed all this time.
Tony scratched his nose, just so he could hide his face with his hand when he passed a security camera, and got close to the Badge Guy and his friend. Separating them from each other was now useless, so he decided to go big, and so he swung the heavy suitcase in his hand at their heads.
Firstly, he hated Stane's Industries, which all of Tony's friends knew as well. He didn't try to hide it, and they were okay with their weird friend.
Steve already informed Natasha that he wouldn't be attending today's meeting, because he got plans for tonight.
Natasha and Steve continued arguing in the kitchen while Clint sighed to himself quietly. He sat on the couch of their sort-of living room, in the Avengers area at the compound. The compound itself was huge but definitely not designed as a place where the best of Earth's freaks could gather in.
So, new plan- taking this Scepter instead of the Tesseract, which was evidently not here. Maybe it had enough power to power up his machines, and maybe just some of them0- but it certainly was something.
Excitement and worry filled Tony's gut, and he didn’t know which he was supposed to rely on for tonight's date.
"I really missed you all, you know? However, I need you to leave now. I really don't have the time to fight you all right now, so please- this time just go. I'll owe you one." His electronic voice said, and even though it was very robotic to the point of no recognition, Steve could still hear the panic over it.
"I know you could pull off a major project without any trouble, so I thought to myself- why not let it be a national one? You can pull it off. You graduated early, and you are very famous around here, so it won’t be too farfetched if you figured out Iron Man tech- I bet the government would buy it. And I know for sure that you would want it- our best people couldn't figure it out, and you always say what losers are SI employees- this is your chance to prove me that you are better than them."
He hacked some SHIELD files the other day and was surprised to see that the weapon they used on his was a simple, paralyzing arrow.
It seemed that the suit was fully functioning again, much to Steve's disappointment and dismay because when Iron Man spoke again it was in his usual robotic voice. "I'm offended, Captain Handsome,"
Iron Man decided to ruin his good reputation by continuing his attacks on Stane Industries, causing a million dollars' worth of damage to the place and the products.
The world held their breath when the figure, which turned to be Iron Man himself, came back from the wormhole in one piece, falling rapidly back to the ground.
Steve could never be too sure, not with a person like Iron Man. "So what exactly are you here for?" he asked, now softer.
"I suggest a dinner, then. No attacking, no missions." The static voice sounded almost hopeful, as in hesitating to ask- and Steve felt a pang of pity in his chest. Or maybe it was hope too, Steve couldn’t tell for sure.
"What do you want now, Iron Man? There are no SI factories nearby! Why are you here?" he shouted up at the metal man in the sky.
He got to this situation because a certain god decided to go easy on The Avengers and just be put in a holding cell, like a fucking idiot.
"It's fine dad! Harley says that you have a difficult job, so I forgive you!" he said, (more like squeaked in Tony's opinion) and Tony, his father, was so happy that his son wasn't angry with him for arriving late for his birthday party.
One by one, all but Banner cleared the lab. Tony pulled out his phone while they passed by, ducking his head all the while Fury and the Widow passed by him- the only two able of seeing that he didn't actually work there.
And despite all of the surprises they had, Hulk catching the vigilante did not give the world a shock. Instead, it warmed most of the people on earth's hearts. A good in the Evil, they said about Iron Man now.
Inside the garage, besides of all his other, less important (and less deadly) creations, a couple of the Iron Man suits were hidden.
Iron man flirted with him constantly on their last fight, all the while continuing his attack on a weapon factory of Stane Industries. Steve flirted back ONE time, getting annoyed and distracted while fighting and Thor and Clint started making fun of him for it, Bruce went completely crazy and Natasha simply continued with her life like a mature adult.
They went over their plan- each fight against this tin-can required a new one-, which now included one paralyzing arrow, courtesy of Stane Industries. The arrow would be able to shut down the Iron Man weapon, as Obadiah Stane himself told them on team briefing. Apparently, they were working on this arrow for months now, but only now it was ready for them to use.
Of course, Steve felt fishy about this new world around him. Everything seemed to be misplaced, and not everything he saw and learned in this new century just added up.
The Scepter seamed to radiate this energy; it glowed with a power that Tony could feel all the way over here.
The thing was, that he would obviously be dead falling off buildings all the time with no help at all, and that's why he was glad he had a flying god/super-prince, if you will, Thor on his team, ready to catch him almost every time.
Poor Dr. Banner. Probably no one ever had a simple conversation like that ever since the Hulk thing.
"I hate this, I hate him. What kind of a monster attacks at four AM anyways?! I mean, doesn't he have something better to do?"
"And what would it be?" he asked her, and she wanted to scream at how tired and sad he looked like this- sitting in his chair like that, with an Ice pack on his stomach while waiting for her answer- "Pep?"
Loki smiled a real smile for the first time in hours in this place. This man could be an allay, he thought to himself, and his smile grew even wider when the alarm started blaring and shouts were heard from outside of his room.
He could almost see a future together, him and Iron Man- or more likely, him and the man behind Iron Man.
And then there was Iron Man. A foe? A friend? He couldn't tell. He saved Hawkeye's life twice, yes, but he was blowing up things all the time, like a terrorist.
Steve couldn't help but blush every time he thought about the rather sweet things Iron Man told him.
"Can you move it back?" Clint almost whispered, and Natasha nodded before moving the feed to show Bruce, about to Hulk out next to the Quinjet. Iron Man was next to him, trying and succeeding in calming him down.
He put back his hearing aids, flinching at the sound of yelling coming from the kitchen and trying to ignore it at the same time- and obviously, failed to do as much.
Tony checked the door behind him, which thankfully was still closed. He stepped aside, where he thought the cameras couldn't make his face and pointed the Scepter at the cage. "Stop calling it yours, I already called dibs. I'm just trying to get out of here, so you really shouldn't care too much about little ol' me. Do you actually know where there is another exit from this god awful place, or are you just annoying me on purpose?"
He reminded himself how proud was everyone he knew when he got through his ninth year without drinking alcohol.
"Well, Director Fury asked me to bring him the Scepter for inspection. The Gem inside was an energy source, a bit like the Tesseract." Not a lie, a totally valid point, "so he wants us to analyze the energy source in a compartment to the both of them."
He told as much to Thor earlier, but the god had pointed out that Clint threw himself off buildings all the time, so nobody will actually stop anything while he's at it.
He got the static response he was waiting for. "I was just looking for you, capsicle! And don't you tell me you didn't miss me as much as I did you!"
That means Hawkeye was his main target now- not to kill, because he couldn't bring himself to kill any of them. But he'll have to keep an eye out for that Hawk. and maybe stop catching him every time he throws himself off a building.
"And by 'Important' she means SHIELD or Avengers-related Important. Not stuffing-32-mini-marshmallows-in-your-mouth Important."
"I thought we had something for a moment there." And with that final line, he flew away, disappearing at dawn.
"You make one comment…" Steve whispered, and they all got on the Quinjet. The flight was quiet, and Steve's thoughts wandered back to their last fight with Iron man, the masked yet named vigilante, as the press sometimes called him Iron man or sometimes a terrorist, most of the times the latter.
'Whoa, there, Banner, as much as I'm happy to see you again, I don’t think seeing the other half of you is quite necessary.'
Hawkeye, Clint as he insisted she called him, nodded his head towards her. "Thank you for coming, Pepper. We needed your insight on a form from Stane Industries, the one about potential enemies of the company?"
Pepper was supposed to attend for a short while today, at the common room of one of the Avengers floors.
“Did dad tell you what we meant when we did this?” She pressed her fingers to his knuckles. One, twice, three times.
“No, it’s permanent.” He wiggled the thin paper, flashing it to her face. “No, I even have a certificate to prove it.”
“Fuck, what are we—gonna—I have to tell the kids.” Steve pressed their foreheads together and kissed Tony three consecutive times. A hard press on the lips, an attempt to quench his fear that this would be the last time. This was all he could do. “God, Tony, we just got Morgan. You can’t—you have to be alright, Tony. Please.”
They reach the hotel. The sky is dripping down in patches of blues and oranges. He didn’t realize they spent so many hours out, and night is coming again.
With his enhanced senses, he hears the sizzle on the industrial stoves inside the building, the banging of table tops as people settle into their seats, the scratch of an ink pen sketching the urban center at a distance.
He grabbed one, bit it, then set it back down. He looked at Morgan and the mess of salsa on her lips.
Tony laughed as Peter and Harley twisted their faces, irritated at their parents. Steve pulled Harley close, and kissed the top of his head. “Well, how do you think you three were made?”
Steve slows his thrusts, snaking a hand to grip Tony’s face, kissing him on the mouth. Tony opens up like the way he opened the Mansion to the Avengers, opened his life to Steve, opened his heart to the world. Tony kisses with generosity, tongue turning and prodding at Steve’s own. Tony kisses like it’s the end of the world. Slow, consuming, Steve lets the end ruin him.
“He always fancied carnations. I think it would be good to do something you like, pops. Even if they remind you of him.” Peter scratched the back of his neck with eyes downcast. “I talk to him sometimes, even though he can’t answer. Sometimes I’m just in the lab, needing to work through an equation or project, and yeah, talking it out, with him, even though he’s not there, it helps. I figure things out.” Peter smiled, heart warm and conflicted. “Even in death he’s still the hero.”
The kids continue digging at their meal, the banter between all of them growing steadier and steadier with laughter and jabs.
It’s been forty-one months of holding his breath and waiting for the thread that tied him to this world and Tony to snap.
Moving his limbs is a difficult feat. He stares at his toes. He thinks they would be cold, but he can’t feel them anymore.
Steve sees red and he’s overcome by this feeling of defiance and need to protect. He doesn’t even know he’s doing it, but Tony takes his fists, uncurls them, and squeezes them. He gives Steve a concerned look. “I’m good. I really am, don’t worry.”
Tony holds Steve’s face with both palms, outlining the shape of his cheekbones. His movements pause for a moment, too short to really notice. There’s a question there, but Steve kisses him quiet.
He’s supposed to be inching towards acceptance. Bereavement was a marathon. But he’s never left the starting point, stagnant and nauseous with the reality he’d have to run for the rest of his life.
“Tony, you cry for me in the middle of the night.” Steve laughed, wrapping both hands on Tony’s shoulders. He pressed their foreheads together, breathing in the smell of sweat, blood, and metal.
Steve spins the flip phone, once, twice, then pockets it. He digs in his heels and walks to the railing. Below, cars zoom past the highway, so trite and normal, he wonders whether these drivers had a destination in mind, or if their steps are aimless, like Steve’s. Or if their families are home, which kin were dusted, if they were making new life, too.
Again and again, they rejected the request. “This is the Plaza! Champagne, please!” He shouted at the receiver a final time, unplugged the stupid phone from the port, and threw it across the room.
“They’ve already seen too much, no use in adding more.” Steve lets the nicotine calm him, and his fingers finally steady. In the distance, Tony’s pulling away from the engine and closing the lid.
“No, it didn’t.” Steve grabbed the robe hanging in the closet. He didn’t offer it to Tony. Instead, he moved Tony’s limbs like a doll and wrapped him up. “I’m sick of fighting you.”
“So, I say we celebrate kicking HYDRA’s ass with food from my favorite Mexican restaurant.” Tony clapped his hands together, unbothered at the dried up blood from his face. The face plate was ripped out of his helmet earlier. His lips were split and bloody.
It’s shoddy and awful and he truly should be better at this for a grown man, but he stays in his spot, feet glued to the tiles. Paralyzed.
In a moment of recklessness, Steve doesn’t think, he lets his mouth do the talking. Consequences be damned. He’s been rejected by the army dozens of times. He’ll survive Tony Stark telling him to fuck off.
“Hmm.” Steve rushed over, walking to meet Tony halfway. He tilted Tony’s chin up, smacking a loud kiss on his cupid bow. “You were great up there, Shellhead.”
“Are you trying to tell me that walking away from my position, from everything would be easy? They’d hunt me down. They’d
But he had a soft spot for their brownstone’s bathroom. It was lavish, almost as big as the kitchen from Steve's childhood home in Brooklyn. There were four showerheads; it was like taking a shower under the rain. There were large windows overlooking New York, satisfying Tony's exhibitionist streak. It was a one way glass. Steve could fuck Tony over the shower's sitting area and look at the New York skyline.
And yet, here they are. Sharing stale air in a room that used to be theirs, bed sheets made together in the morning, pillows kicked at night. The window curtains are parted because Steve likes the night light from the busy, New York city. It’s an artifact he holds onto from his days growing up in the belly of the city. Tony prefers sleeping pitch black, but lets the light pass because Steve likes it. And he loves Steve.
“I didn’t come to talk at all.” Steve tilts his head, he’s looking around the Tower, this place they once shared and tried to build into a home, even for just a few weeks.
There are new lines on Tony's face, and Steve hopes like hell they are from laughter. His hair is still dark, a deep chestnut color, but are also streaks of grays in the fringes, especially beside his ear. It curls like a smile, and Steve has to shove his hands into his pockets to stop from reaching out.
Now, they gather as Red Wolf stands in the center, face darkened by his hat. His badge gleams under the sun.
“Matching set, huh?” Tony paused, hand up in the air. He still looked keyed up, but his eyes were red-rimmed and heavy.
No, Steve didn’t really know her to believe it, or to know why Tony’s reacting this way. He’s only spent a few weeks with Carole Danvers. It was just weeks after the Snap, when they were all hanging by the thread waiting to see if the loss could be reversed.
His nose was running with snot, just as much as Tony’s. “We already spoil them, baby. They’re gonna be a mess and Harley will roast you for not telling him about this.”
Tony drops his head to the side, slurs something, and Steve considers it means yes, because Tony was just kissing him and urging their hips together.
“I just wanted to check,” Steve whispered, letting his index finger run over the five inch scar tissue starting from the middle of Tony’s head. It’s been a couple years since Tony’s emergency surgery and follow-up radiation treatment. But Steve’s always wondering
I close my eyes and pretend the sound of stereo from the apartment across the street is the humming of an engine.
“Seat yourself,” the barkeeper calls out, and Steve, alert as ever, falls back to his seat with a deep breath.
Steve dropped down to an empty chair by the door. It was arranged in a circle but he preferred a seat with a view of all the exits.
Steve nods and sets down his cutlery, keeping his attention on Tony who suddenly refuses to meet his eyes. “Queens.”
He grabs Tony’s hips, bracing himself—and then he watches his cock slide in, right to the hilt. He’s home.
He wonders if Tony got any sleep. He wonders if he’ll bid Steve goodbye. He stares at the horizon and wonders why he’s crying. He wishes that it will all be alright.
There was no victory here, just loss. Steve’s heart broke again and again, knowing he’d live the next half of the century without Tony. Maybe more.
“Until our paths cross again, Tony. Be it with you in the sky, in your red and gold suit. Me on the ground, looking up at you in awe and adoration. Always. Today, tomorrow, and the rest of my life.” Steve wore a shaky smile and let the sound of the city wash over him.
“I’m not even dressed,” Steve says weakly, trying not to smell himself. He’s not trying to be argumentative. He’s just caught off guard. Why now? He shuts his eyes, thinks of so many mornings with Tony in bed, their windows open, eyes catching at the little old hummingbird hung on their tree so many months ago.
In the shadows of the night, the city kept moving. He filtered out alerts from Exremis and focused on Steve. He refused to glance at the dark corners of the room, lit up only from the bathroom’s light.
Time slipped by, fast—like sand slipping from his fingers when he closed his fist—and slow, like being trapped in unmoving traffic.
He sighs. “Alright.” He looks down at his boots and jeans. They’re not dressed for a trail, but they’ve trekked through worse in missions. “Up for a hike?”
“And I built it,” Steve quips back, leaning down to kiss Tony softly on the lips. Just as he’s about to pull away, Tony bites his lips, once, hard, then licks his mouth open, deepening the kiss.
They stayed like that for a while. The sound of the machines lulling them. Eventually, Tony made room for Steve on the bed, but with all of his big bulkiness, Steve's body was hanging off the bed.
“No, wait. JARVIS can you get it back?” Harley made a sound of protest, shooting up to grab the helmet.
In lieu of an answer, Steve kisses Tony soundly, and when Tony’s lips part, he slips in his tongue, trying to communicate that of course, the world is still a mess; half the universe returned.
Steve assumed a leadership position in his time at the Army, then with the Avengers. Steamrolling through conversations and giving direction was part of the position. With the long-standing hierarchy of such institutions, he never gave it a sound thought.
Her red roots have grown past her ears, but she's kept the blonde coloring of her hair. It’s long and braided to the side. She looks at him cooly and settles her muddy shoes on the dash. Steve pretends to be annoyed, but it's short lived.
Do you know what it’s like to sit in a cell with your blood on my hands?” Steve balled his fists and inched towards Tony. He pointed a finger, screaming, “With the taste of your blood still in my mouth?”
Steve fucks him into the night, opening him up with careful fingers, like it’s the first time all over again. He takes his time scissoring Tony open, licking when his fingers aren’t enough.
“No need to say that.” Steve tries to smile and fails. Tony doesn’t owe him anything, in fact, it’s Steve that has a list of things to apologize for, so much so, he doesn’t know where to begin. Steve’s hand automatically drops to his pocket where he feels the old, battered flip phone. Tony follows the movement, and realization seems to dawn on him, too.
said that one should voice their concerns to family members, close friends, or even better, a therapist.
All the tools on Tony’s favorite workbench were still there, untouched. A screwdriver, a pipe wrench. Even with the kids coming down to the workshop, they’ve respected Steve’s wishes to not mess with Tony’s favorite worktable. Harley and Peter now had free reign with the bots, suits, and machinery as long as they checked in with Steve about their projects. Morgan took over the sofa and had her own sketchbook there now.
Tony shakes away the forlorn expression on his face. “Alright, yeah, I met Riri there. Building her own Iron Man suit. Can’t understand why.”
“I never said that I was good,” Steve whispers, giving into the urge to push Tony’s hair back. “You did. But yes, I’ll take care of you.”
“I’m sorry, I didn’t think anyone would be here so late.” She turned to him, biting her lips. “Won’t you go grab a soda by the machine?”
“I’m sorry, Harley. Sir only wanted it to be played once. It was programmed to be terminated immediately after viewing.”
It’s alright. Steve tells himself to get a fucking grip and do some actual fucking. He came here for a goddamn reason and he’s not leaving until he gets it done.
Steve walked to the closet, grabbed one of Tony’s shirts and boxers. He turned his back to Tony and stripped, all mechanical movements. The muscles of Steve’s shoulders stretched as he pulled the shirt off. Pants were next, and even with his bare ass in front of Tony’s eyes, there was no seduction, no playfulness.
Tony doesn’t say anything, though he looks slightly annoyed with how Steve keeps changing the stations. Finally, he stops messing with the stereo and leaves it be. They pass a sign that notes wild animals crossing, and then, there’s another billboard of Amish township miles away. They’ve been in Ohio’s state lines for several hours now, driving miles and miles.
Tony fell in and out of sleep. He’d wake then mutter something about schematics, the kids, or being Iron Man, then cuddle closer to Steve. The sun was way up high, marking the time as past noon.
Tony’s smiling so wide that his gums were showing. “Yeah. You didn’t know? It’s so obvious! He’s always following her around even though he pretends not to. She’s always got her eyes on him even though she acts like she’s just inspecting him for weapons. So obvious.” Tony popped the end of the ice cream cone in his awaiting mouth.
“Can’t help it.” Tony shrugs, apathetic to the sensation of dread brewing in the pits of his stomach. “He makes me bitter.”
“Honeybear, you flew the suit just to get me these. I’m gonna eat them. God, I hope I don’t vomit.” Tony opened his mouth for another piece. Steve delivered it, breaking off a sliver and pressing it to Tony’s mouth. “Thank you, baby.” Tony kissed his thumb, chewed, then swallowed with a grimace.
The salesman smiles, opens the drawer to his left, and sets a folded map between them. His fingers smooth the creases. “So, we’re here, right? And we’d go west through…”
“Well, sir, that’s Tony Stark,” Steve replies with what he hoped was a charming smile. It’s his best caricature of Captain America these days.
Tony turned to Rhodes and Pepper, resting his head on Steve’s chest. “You’ll make sure he’ll be alright, Rhodey, Pep. Won’t you?”
He checked the functionality of Extremis because he was not invincible and he’d never tried to be anything other than human, but sometimes desperation meant injecting yourself with a reality check — that you weren't like them and you couldn’t do much outside of the armor. Without it, you were a vulnerable piece of shit, just like the rest of this sorry world.
It looped and looped. A cycle of mismatched photographs with the same narration. It kept unlocking as the days passed, as if his brain was trying to rewrite the backup and force the truth out.
“It has been too quiet here these past couple of weeks without America.” The other girl with thick curly hair puts her hand on her chin and smiles at Steve.
his mechanical view quiet against the wind. He held Steve up with ease, and they flew and flew with Tony directing him towards different mountain ranges and rattling out information relayed by FRIDAY.
“Yeah.” Steve swallows and stares at the looming building. It used to be home. “How is he? Does he know I’m here.”
“Your dad said that we have the rest of our lives.” Steve inhaled deeply, trying to center himself. “And I think, in that moment it was true. He spent the rest of his life with me. With us. It was true for him.”
Steve tried to console Morgan, holding her on one arm while he made rounds to greet Sam and the rest of the attendees. They were a small group. It was just the Avengers, Maria Hill, Sharon Carter, and Nick Fury.
Steve smiles, a small curl of the lips but it’s blinding and he carried Tony to bed last night, tucked him in, and has now made him breakfast. Is this what it means to be treated well? He hops from foot to foot, watching as Steve sets the plates and steaming coffee on a tray, smiling all the while.
Everything will be fine, Steve tells himself, and when it’s not, Tony will be by his side and they’ll handle it all together.
Instead, Tony gathers his failing courage—maybe it’s recklessness—he leans forward, sucks his tongue, then spits on Steve’s face.
Steve didn’t have the energy to tell them not to call his daughter Maguna. That was Tony’s nickname for Morgan.
The words are spiky and true. It’s like how Tony chases at awful things because he doesn’t know what else to do.
The rooftop garden needed work. Steve should clean it up, tend the garden back into something comforting, rather than letting it fester as a grave.
He wiped his tears with the heel of his hand, irritated that he was here at all. He didn’t want to draw attention to himself, yet here he was, uttering these words and wondering where they were all coming from. He thought he was fine, doing well, given everything—he worked, he cared for his children, listened to them attentively, and ate healthy.
“Okay, we have later. All the time in the world, right?” The sting in his eyes were back, but Steve pushed through. Tony needed him.
Of course not. You’re Steve. You might have smiled your way through it. You don’t have to carry the world anymore. We’ll be fine, Steve. We’ll be alright.
He straightened his back, catching Tony’s hand and pausing them before he could flip to the next page. Tony frowned, looking at Steve with searching eyes.
“You need to let them be there for you. Or else, you’ll all struggle. Have you thought about seeing a therapist?”
“He sure knows how to make an appearance,” Carol says with an eyeroll. She passes the bowl of chili to Bucky’s waiting fingers.
Eventually, the song ended and another one began. Morgan fell asleep on his lap as the two boys started tapping on their tablets. Steve closed his eyes and breathed. In and out, in and out. Everything was fine.
“Our kid,” Steve repeats in wonder. He closes his eyes for a brief moment, tears falling once again. When he blinks them open, Tony’s got a smile on his face.
“Rick Jones was my friend, too. I did what I had to do to make a better world. If friendship is the cost of that, I’m willing to pay that price.”
Now, she’s got her face plastered to the truck’s window, causing condensation which blows and draws a tiny heart before pointing at the melting snowcaps. Steve smiles, indulging her by driving down the winding roads and taking the long way home.
Its cloudy haze is easily washed away by the breeze, as if the sea is scolding them for smelling like anything else.
He bottoms out, circling his hips as he looks for Tony’s sweet spot. At least he’ll make Tony feel good.
Tony blows out a deep breath, then says, overly casual, “Yeah? They played it at Carol and Rhodey’s wedding, you know.”
He didn’t know if it was selfish for him to wish it was slower. Just so they could have more time together. Steve’s a greedy bastard but that’s what happens to desperate people.
She guides his hand down Tony’s ass and thighs, both of them feeling Tony’s warm skin. Goosebumps erupt, and of
Jessica Drew — Vereanke, Tony’s mind supplies, screams, eyes turning enormous. It punches the nearest body, beats it bloody before Peter Parker, pulls her away. It slaps Peter Parker in the face, kicks his stomach, and she’s screaming, Its face wild and monstrous, still wearing Drew’s face.
There’s surprise painted on Tony’s face; it turns into a slow smile. “Thank you very kindly. Please pass on our appreciate to them.”
I still remember the way you like your coffee in the morning. Made from a pot because you’re old fashioned and utilitarian and no matter how I tried to get you into the habit of using the machine, you refused. No matter, I had thought, it’s just a small thing. Then, you refused bigger things so much so that those small things didn’t matter anymore. Well. I thought they didn’t. I remember. I remember the way you like your eggs and how you smell late at night.
His children always floored him with simple words and casual mentions of Tony. Steve swallowed, wishing he could get up and excuse himself.
Steve lived with a man for two decades and built a life together. Words couldn’t capture the aching howl in his chest or the desire to be dead, too. He just had to sit with it.
“You ought to take care of yourself while I’m at work, Tony.” Steve shakes his head, false concern evident in his features, and it’s truly, utterly fucked because Tony will pretend that the worry is real. “I’m already dealing with trying to rebuild this country. If you don’t take care of yourself, I’ll worry. I can’t be distracted right now.”
, Steve, dragging Sharon back into his mess. Steve’s only wanted one thing since he’s woken up from the ice, and that’s to belong and have someone, honestly and wholeheartedly. No doubt, no remorse, no guilt. Something ordinary, and easy, where he doesn’t have to explain that he enjoys getting his face beaten in, that he feels alive in every fight.
Steve scrubbed his eyes, annoyed at the hot tears. How many more years was he going to cry? He was just waiting for his turn, waiting for death to come. He couldn’t think like that. He had his children to care for, but sometimes, there was the fleeting thought: it would be easier if he gave up and followed Tony.
“Sometimes I’m scared too,” he admits because losing this quiet life they’ve built is always a possibility. “You deserve so much more than me.”
He imagines he isn't in this room full of shackles and rotten, uneaten food, pretends that he's lying in the rubble of a battlefield because that would be true to form.
Steve took the subway often, riding and getting off whenever he felt like it. Destination unknown. Sometimes, he grimly thought that living life in limbo was like riding a subway car alone. He often did that when returning from SHIELD headquarters in Queens, riding back to Brooklyn late in the evening. Sometimes, he’d share the car with people going into the city for a night-shift. Sometimes, Steve would greet them, desperate to talk to someone who didn’t deal with international crises. But most times, Steve was alone, stuck with his own thoughts and desire to belong.
Then, your bloodied body on the examination table used to be punishment. But I’m trying to hold onto that memory now.
“He had some ideas about what you all might like.” Steve didn’t want to open up the sheet and stare at Tony’s scrawl. No, he’d do that later. “He helped—he did—he helped pick out—”
“Tony,” Steve calls softly, and he was well and thoroughly fucked because no one in Timely ever called him that.
“What are you two up to? And where are we going?” Steve is trapped in the middle seat as Sam and Bucky sandwich him and start the engine.
The suit is still steel gray, excellent for recons in the evening. But he’s playing with the idea of painting it red.
Tony grabs the pistol. “Go. It’s no good for you to stay here. Go back to your planet, or further West, or —”
Pepper nodded, her bangs falling to the side of her face. She squeezed Steve’s hand and led them to the plush sofas. “He’s at rest.”
Tony glances at him, and Steve has to clench his fists to stop himself from prying the sunglasses off Tony’s face. He’s always liked Tony with sunglasses on, especially after he got past his initial annoyance at the bravado. He realizes it’s probably because Tony is an arresting sight.
Getting to the last button, Steve leaned away to admire Tony’s flushed face and heaving chest. Steve traced the scarring on Tony’s sternum with a finger tip.
Without thought, he stepped out of the shower, scrubbed his wet hair, and wrapped the towel around his waist.
“You look like you need comfort. You saved me there, I’m just returning the favor,” Tony looks down at their hands, then removes his fingers. Steve can’t tell from the darkness, but he wonders if Tony is blushing. His movements are soft, laguid due to the alcohol and whatever cocktail of drugs he’s taken inside the beach house.
He would sit on the unoccupied stool beside Tony, breathe down his neck and watch, mesmerized, by those nimble fingers and that smart mouth explaining how circuits worked and what sort of improvements he’d be making to everyone’s gear.
They’ve had a good run as Avengers, an independent group of superheroes governed by their own mission and checked by the United Nations. Tony and Pepper handled all the bureaucracy, Steve didn’t really know the details. Tony handled it and Steve trusted his decisions. Together, the Avengers team drafted a set of guidelines which was then finalized as the Accords.
Natasha doesn’t move. Instead, she leans further back on the seat and crosses her arms. “I didn’t think you’d actually come,” she adds. “Been busy?”
Later, he woke up, not even realizing that he fell asleep. Tony was tucked half on Steve’s shoulder, mouth open. Drooling. It should be disgusting, but his heart stuttered. Tony looked at peace, comfortable. Steve wished to put his arms around Tony.
“Tony. That’s not.” Steve tried, moving closer to the bed. He dropped on the foot of the mattress. “I didn’t mean that, Shellhead.”
Steve puts his hands on Tony, lifting him up from the floor and hoisting him up to the bed. Tony backs away to the pillows and Steve’s just right behind him. Looking at him. Always looking. It’s a never ending observation with Steve.
Steve steps out of the barn and walks the short distance towards the house. He finished the outdoor bathroom just a few weeks ago, when spring was maturing into summer. There’s a trellis that serves as a partial roof, with the actual roofing underneath it. The ivys cascade down the side of the side walls, and there, by the left side of the bathroom hangs another bird feeder.
He smiles at Tony during dinner and laughs at all the correct beats, doing his best imitation of acting like a normal, adjusted man. He engages Bruce in a short conversation about plants and ignores Riri and Kate’s raised eyebrows.
When Steve didn’t think of Tony, he wondered if he was alright, if he was at peace. He might never be whole again.
“I know. You don’t gotta tell me that.” Tony pushes his plate back, burger only half eaten. “Even after all these years, it’s still there. I carry that shit with me.”
“Starving.” Steve licked his lips, tasting the sweat and the day there, and wishing it was something else.
He shook his head, then realized Tony wasn’t even looking at him. Instead, Tony sat on the sleek leather couch, cross-legged, and waved him over.
Even with our choice of careers, I’ve always thought we had time. Maybe I think you were invincible because I look up to you, Steve. An inspiration to all of us. But here you are, gone, buried in the depths of the ocean once again. Namor promised you’ll be undisturbed. Rest easy, old friend.
Tony always got obsessed with a project. Got fixated on making things right, letting it consume him until it was his only thought, the last refrain on his head, echoing over and over.  But now, he didn’t care. Nothing mattered.
Steve continues his shallow thrusts, bringing his forehead to Tony’s. The gesture is intimate, and Steve makes it worse by taking a lock of Tony’s hair and pushing it behind his ear. “A dream made real,” he says, fingers finding the wetness on Tony’s eyes and wiping it away.
“I have to —” Tony sobs the words out, hating how he can’t keep his mouth shut. His abdomen is starting to hurt, and his face heats all the way from his crown to his nape.
“Didn’t you want to beat the shit out of me when I tried to pay a price? Now, it seems like morality is a moving target for you.”
It’s only now that Steve realizes he’s also exhausted, and while he’d rather have company during the duration of the meal, he’s used to eating alone by now.
He licks Steve’s cock, ghosting it with his tongue, teasing before letting a mouthful of saliva drip, slow, slow, slow on his thick shaft. He watches the spit lick Steve’s dick, dripping down to his heavy balls. “Fuck. Steve.”
Tony is handsome. Steve’s known this for ages. Even when he didn’t know Tony Stark and Iron Man were the same man, he’s always been fond of Mr. Stark, the Avengers benefactor. Seeing him here, naked and wanton, a layer of sweat defining his pecs, his arms, those broad, muscular shoulders…
The sheets were new, pulled to the corners and pristine. The tools were placed in a bag against the wall. The nail gun was nowhere in sight.
“Say no, if you want,” Steve pauses, watching Tony’s glassy eyes. His lips are slick with saliva. The sky is dark, but the lights from the pier dance shadows on his face. “You’re so gorgeous. Say no, tell me no.”
“Come for me—let me feel you make me wet. Come inside me,” Tony gasps out, his hand going to the nape of Steve’s neck, playing with the soft hairs there. “Please, I want to feel you—please—please… Harder, keep going. I want to
Pepper handled the funeral service with the care and efficiency only someone who knew Tony could do. She informed their close friends and issued a press release with the assistance of Tony’s personal solicitors and SI’s public relations team.
Tony mumbles something, keeping his hands to the floor. He’s no longer grinding against Steve, so Steve works harder, twisting his hips, making circles to draw out a moan.
Still, Steve is distracted by the tension on Tony’s shoulders. He’s holding the muscles of his body carefully, like he’s scared Steve might crash and have to pull Steve out of a burning car. The seatbelt is a crease against his shoulder. His jaw is set, has been for hours now. Tony doesn’t look at his phone, and Steve is surprised that his gaze remains on the highway, tracking every township they pass.
He has been careful to not ask too much after Tony, and if he did, he always did it with the pretense of asking about everyone else: the team, what’s left of them, the Compound, whether it’s still a tomb pretending to be a home.
He suggested they get a place together—not the Tower, which was attached to SI and the business world, but something that belonged to them. Steve wanted a place they’d build together.
They weren’t wrong. He coddled Tony, gave him everything he wanted, and could never say no to him. Rhodes and Carol teased that Tony would become even more of a brat, but so what? He was Steve’s brat. Alive and healthy, that’s all that mattered.
“No, yeah, I’m sorry. I didn’t mean to sound curt.” He set the bottle down, leaned on the counter, away from the celebrating group. “It’s just, you know. ”
I think the rest of the Avengers wanted to keep you in our time. I was attempted, too. But it wouldn’t be right.
“I’m pretty sure FRIDAY has already alerted him the moment you drove through the gates. You can ask him yourself.”
Tony chews, the swallows, his Adam’s apple bopping before reaches for the glass of water. He smiles, it’s a small, effortless thing. “Honestly, Kate just showed up one day and said we needed a Hawkeye. Then, I found Riri in a bodega in the corner of the old Tower on Fifth Ave. She was making a suit out of a box of scraps. Scavenging for supplies in the dumpster. Kind of like Peter, actually… you remember Peter…”
“Yeah, um,” there he goes again, scratching at his temple and being out of his depth. So, instead, Steve just goes for honesty. “I’ll head out. You’ll be alright?”
Tony wondered if her pain could have been measured. If he could scavenge the blood long erased from the platform and inspect how much more he could withstand before he reached that moment too.
Steve could do this. He could hash this out now, say a million practiced apologies, list out his faults and where he’s wrong and how he’ll get better and they’ll be fine goddamnit, but he settles for the digging in his feet and saying the truth: “It would mean a lot if you joined me.”
Tony used to trim his goatee every morning, making precise cuts before tousling his hair with a touch of product. Sometimes, he caught Steve admiring him from the mirror and winked. Steve looked at the mirror, but he was alone. No Tony. Just Steve.
“Yeah,” Steve agrees, thinking of losing Bucky again, not being able to get to know the man he’s become, and would have become after the triggers were removed. His mind drifts to Sam, too caring, a man with too much heart and an easy going smile. Wanda and Vision. Then, T’Challa’s kindness which Steve will never be able to repay.
Monday mornings means waking up extra early so Tony can fly her to school. Sometimes they’re late because Tony flies her through the mountain, letting her fingers glide over the pines. Steve always stands on the veranda, watching the suit form over Tony’s body, and Morgan strapping herself to her father’s armour.
He pressed Steve further down, “Geez, why do you have to be so tall? You should just kneel for me, Steve. I think it would be easier.” He teased with a smirk.
That’s the thing about resilience: you bounce back. You can take more and more and more and more. You stitch yourself together and the bruises eventually fade. Who cares about the scars no one can see.
He gives Steve time to adjust. He brings Steve back to his old flat by the Sheriff’s station and hides himself in the workshop.
Tony leans against him to whisper, “it really was over coffee, though,” and shares a secret smile with Steve.
Steve could take it at any moment, lace their fingers together, ask for something he doesn’t have a name for. He places his hand on his lap, leans further back until the meat of his shoulders are digging into the curve of the wooden chair.
Outside, New York was alive and booming. Taxis honked, and a cyclist yelled for pedestrians to move from the streets. Tony smiled, and turned to Steve. “Did they have sesame?”
Maybe he'll succumb to infection first. If the chains were a little shorter, he'd already have bashed his head to the wall.
Steve congratulates himself for holding back a quick retort. It wouldn't do any good, and Samuel appears to be a man who will fight him tooth and nail for agreement. He could really use a smoke now.
Tony followed Steve through the turnstile and waited for the 1 train to arrive. He walked to the edge of the platform, leaning over to look at the tunnel.
Steve listens to Tony’s breath even out after awhile. It’s followed by a snore in the darkness. The light from outside filters against the open parting of the curtains. Shadows dance against the ceiling.
“But how? You’re alive? How is that possible?” Tony can’t help but reach for him. He wants to grab Steve’s lapples.
Tony looked down to see the gum beside his shoe. The tracks were littered with garbage and fallen Metrocards. But no dead bodies, and everyone in the station appeared satisfied enough to simply wait for the train to arrive.
Tony took a part of him and Steve will never get those jagged fragments back. That’s fine, too. He could say goodbye to parts of himself as long as those pieces belonged to Tony.
“Just be you,” Steve insists, reaching for her head. She lets him grab it and squeezes, hard, three times, then lets go.
Rumiko pulls out, the dildo bobbing on Tony’s right ass cheek. She turns and waves Steve over with a wicked grin.
Steve takes his face in both of his hands, forcing their heads together. They breathe each other's scent. Tony smells like Steve’s come. He doesn’t know how it happens, but they’re kissing again, tongues delving in deep, sucking and prodding into each other’s mouth. When Steve pulls away, he pauses, then determined, says, “Open.”
Eventually, they make it back to Tony and his little crew of children. Samuel greets them all, and calls one of them over to deliver a message to their mothers. “Tell them there’s a man here that might be able to fix her washer and dryer. Oh and tell the Kim’s that we got help for them too.”
“What is it?” he asked, moving the fingers with nails still stuck in them. His hand had stopped bleeding sometime ago. Every time he swung the bottle, he eyed the way his skin protruded. He tapped the bed to a beat, waiting.
Steve kisses him, sweet like he’s afraid to break Tony, and it’s so different from the daily beatings he had endured when he first woke up, limbs aching from disuse.
“A change is gonna come,” Tony sing songs at the exact time. “And it did,” he adds as the song finishes.
He stayed plastered on the chair a beat longer, then straightened his back. He waved Bucky’s concern away and gathered the dishes. He placed all the leftover food in containers and  stacked the dirty plates on their deep porcelain sink.
“A lot happening for a small town,” Tony says, observing a family crossing the street and a couple with three Labradors being pulled in the other direction.
He stood, fixed the bed methodically, ensuring all the sheets were fitted in each corner. He tucked it into the mattress and the box spring. He put the duvet on top, fluffed the pillows just the way Tony liked it—fixing the decorative embroidered pillows they got from a trip in Thailand.
They both have faith in the team to handle it all, especially now with the Guardians out there watching their orbit, the Fantastic Four setting up shop in Manhattan, and new super powered individuals popping up all over the world.
“Sometimes.” He shrugs. “You come home from running from war, you never stop running. Don’t realize it though.”
He’d  get sober tomorrow. He would. Tomorrow would be different. Tomorrow he might jump out of the window instead and forget he could call the armor in an instant. Make it look like an accident.
He runs a hand over Tony’s hair, caresses his face, smoothing the lines on the corner of his eyes. “Ssst—”
“Still.” He can’t help but feel like he should have put in an effort. Hell, he should have planned this, he could have.
“Nothing can keep me from your dad.” Steve says, eyes on Tony who meets his gaze with a look full of love.
Steve listens and counts the low tides creeping against the shore. From their vantage point, cars speed past the lanes. A new song plays from the stereos perched on the staccato textured walls. The woman beside him erupts in a coo, and they clap as the song begins, shaking their shoulders up and down, smiles gracing their features.
He continues to fuck Tony's legs, no care about his cock getting wet with the piss dripping down Tony's thighs. "Come on,”  Steve moans, loud, his thrust growing erratic. “Piss on my cock.”
Tony wondered about Steve and his final thoughts at the Courthouse. Whether he regretted smearing blood all over Sharon Carter, or if he found blame in that son of a bitch, Tony Stark.
I think you might be pissed at me. I shot my own foot today, or I guess, sometime yesterday.  Don’t worry, it’ll grow back. What a day, old pal. It makes me want to believe in God. I got to sleep now.
While he’s out there, being an unoriginal vagabond, here’s Tony Stark rebuilding his home, planting roots, a little too raw, if Steve’s guess is correct.
I miss you. I miss you. I miss you. I miss you. I miss you. I miss you. I miss you. I miss you. I miss you. I miss you. I miss you. I miss you. I miss you. I miss you. I miss you. I miss you. I miss you. I miss you. I miss you. I miss you. I miss you. I miss you. I miss you. I miss you.
He didn’t know how long they sat in the tub. The water turned cold and Tony’s fingers were white and pruney. But Steve kept humming and kneading the knots on his shoulders, and all Tony knew was that he didn’t deserve this.
Tony is doing better, his sleep is still disturbed, so he spends nights pacing the workshop, pretending that Steve isn't just across the way.
Tony woke up slowly and stood on shaky legs. The room was clean. There was a plastic bag by the door filled with garbage, old newspapers from days ago, empty water bottles, moldy toast. He could see the outline of the vase he threw across the room inside. The puke was cleared off, now a stain on the rug.
They’re fucking, and it’s explicit and obscene, and Tony is making filthy sounds that go straight to Steve’s cock, but he can’t help the pang of envy that tugs at his chest when Tony turns his head to capture Rumiko’s lips, soft and sweet.
“I didn’t.” Steve’s behind him now. There’s a puff of air raising goosebumps on his neck. A shiver runs down his spine and Tony has to bite the gasp trying to escape when Steve puts a hand on his hip. Tony closes his eyes, gives in, rests his head on the curve of Steve’s shoulders.
“Honey, huh?”  Rhodey snorts  and good naturedly pulls Tony into a headlock followed by a tight hug.
Steve stood, exited the tub and grabbed a towel. His clothes soaked the floor but he paid it no mind. Instead, he guided Tony up and dried him. Patting the towel over his shoulders and scrubbing his hair. A brief wipe over his cock. Tony wondered if Steve was like this with his lovers, too. Attentive in a domineering sort of way.
Tony’s eyes shut close, there’s a tiny whimsical frown on the curve of his lips. “Still broken,” he says, likely thinking of new fractions of villains and trouble makers popping up around the world.
The two boys stuck their tongues out and engaged Tony in a conversation. They always wanted their dad’s approval; wanting to discuss new projects, how to improve their robots, whether they’d be able to use a part of JARVIS’ code for their own AI.
“Fuck,” Tony barked, twisting the cap open. He didn’t bother grabbing a glass to pour the whiskey into. “I really shouldn’t drink. Rhodey and Pepper will have my ass if they find out. So you won’t tell them, right, Cap? Well, no.” Tony tilted his head after a swing. He dropped the bottle with a slam that echoed through the room. “You don’t seem to be good at keeping secrets.”
“God, Tony, what the fuck.” Steve settled on the bed as the doctors left. Outside the door, the active Avengers were milling, concerned. Steve shook his head as Natasha popped her head through the doorway. “Just…give us a few minutes, Nat.”
Steve kissed it, once, twice, then ran a hand through Tony’s hair, feeling for the scar on the back of his head. “It’ll be okay, Tony.”
When they reach the hall, Tony says, “All I was trying to say is that I think Peter would have liked you. In another life. If you met him.”
and well, isn’t funny that Tony measures his worth in the same way. They were under the moonlight and they had a good conversation, one that was genuine and for once, it wasn’t about the brand name
“No.” Steve felt his lips move into a matching grin. He stood up, offered Tony a hand. “You lead, I’ll follow.”
Losing you and having to keep on living with you might be the hardest thing I have to do. Somedays, I think it gets easier. That’s what us mortal livings have to tell ourselves. Day by day, the world keeps spinning. But you know, the scientist in me understands that there’s a life out there, away from this blue marble. There’s life out there, greater than me and you. We’ve both seen that in other planets. Other galaxies. I don’t know what you did to me, but somehow, the vastness of existence doesn’t seem to matter as much. I grieve you, Steve. I hope you know that. It’s hard to live knowing I’ve had a hand in losing you. Some nights, I think, maybe if we talked more, if I tried harder. If we didn’t settle on punches on the Mansion, maybe you’d be here. But it’s hard to change your mind. I know you, Steve. I’m the same way. I wish we weren’t so stubborn and that we were better men.
It was Bucky. The tape was blurry, but there was no doubt that he was the Winter Soldier they’ve been tracking for the last few months. They bastardized his best friend.
“You’re human. Don’t think you’re not, Steve. You may have the serum, but you can die like the rest of us.”
Steve laced their fingers together, keeping them on his thigh. He can do that now. “Can I kiss you?”
“Why?” He stared at the lines on Steve’s face. There was a new freckle on the edge of his left eye. He wanted to lean over, press his mouth against it. “Why are you being so nice now?”
Even in the distance, he can hear Tony's voice, light and amused. It's different from his tone when speaking to Avengers or the press. He octave is higher and he quips out a sarcastic remark throughout the exchange. Steve hears children laughing.
Steve is all over the papers. They all laud him for doing excellent work to protect the nation. They write articles about how Commander Rogers is dealing with the fallout of the Skrull Invasion. They proclaim that he’s rebuilding the world, and it’s so much better this way because when Tony Stark was running the show, he fucked up.
They question him about his travels, and when Steve’s lost for words to describe what he’s done, they wait. He stumbles upon descriptions of suburbs, unincorporated towns, and villages across the world, offering what little has to give. He doesn’t say much.
“So, I just wear his face and you fuck me and apologize and when you’re upset, you hurt me the way you would never have hurt him right? Because now, what does it matter, he’s gone. Dead. By your hands. Your shield. That’s on you.”
He nods, understanding why she stayed, why she’s here, hurting but determined to stand her ground, rebuild the shattered parts of her, even if the process is gruesome. Steve wishes he could be a little more like her. But Steve is Steve, and sometimes it's easier when you refuse to stare at yourself in the mirror and question how you can get better, whether that’s even possible.
“Yes. Thank you, Ru.” Tony smiles, voice in awe, like he’s been given a gift he could never have asked for. “Thank you. For giving me this.”
Steve would be pleased if he could feel any emotion other than rage or misery. His life was a pendulum swing between wanting to punch a hole in the wall and the desire to just not exist.
He stays put, shifting his feet until the floors creak. “Well, who am I to deny you anything you want?” Tony makes a show of flexing his wrists in circles, then resumes his performance.
Steve’s husband — his husband, oh, he’ll never get used to the endearment — is grumpy today. Tony wears a frown despite the heating blasting from the truck. Steve knows that in days like this, when it’s freezing, Tony’s shoulder starts to ache with phantom pain.
Steve swallows. His jaw works, clenching and unclenching until it finally settles into something looser. The fire still burns inside him, because this is fucking Steve. He looks at Tony in disbelief, shame. “Even now? Even after —”
He grabbed the razor and tossed it to the garbage. He stared at the electric toothbrush for a beat, then laid it on the counter. He’ll recycle it later.
“Oh, oh, yes, god, yes. Please, harder, harder,” Tony cries between every other thrust, panting and twisting his body, meeting Steve’s pace, and a growl—a sound he’s never heard outside of battle—comes out of him. With his free hand, Steve lifts Tony’s waist, plunging deeper. “God—fuck—
Tony huffs, and it’s a soft sound in the quiet of their room. Steve knows this tone of voice. This is Tony brushing off his excellence and selflessness as nothing, as if it’s the norm for the rest of the world.
Instead, she simply shook her head, tutted, and said, what are we gonna do with you, Steve? How he survived two weeks coughing and bed-ridden is another question. He used to be convinced his mother consulted a shaman up the street, but these days, he thinks the universe simply wants to test how many more bad decisions he can make in his lifetime.
“I can be very convincing.” Tony waggles his eyebrows, then immediately stops, like a child caught something they’re not supposed to be doing. Steve hates it. Hates this stop-go-stop-go, hot-cold. Tony smoothens out his jacket and picks at it, body half turned away from Steve. “Sometimes,” he says, like an afterthought.
Up ahead, there’s a house with a plum tree on its front lawn and two kids stooping low on the grass. They wave and make faces at Steve, and he wonders what it’s like to be them, free with innocent wonder.
“Your husband doesn’t want to sleep alone. He prefers sleeping with your arms around him.” Steve swiped the sweaty hair from his face. He had a good half-marathon run around Central Park earlier.
He rode the train so long that twice, he watched the same set of teenage kids dancing around the poles, trying to make tips from the subway riders. He sat still, hands laced on his lap, fingers massaging the space in the middle of his palm. Irritated, annoyed, trying to find purpose in a life barely lived.
Steve took off the glasses and set it on the table. He waved a hand on the holoscreen to cancel the scene. It disappeared in a flash.
"Obadiah Stane decided that you will go with a different plan from now on, and director Fury will be there tomorrow to deliver it for you."
He went down the hall, and once getting out of Banner's view, started to check out the path in front of him, Scepter behind his back and as hidden as possible.
Now, he was treating the wound he got today in the fight while trying not to think of how his heart ached more than his bleeding abdomen.
"Yeah, it's fine. But you need to be careful running around like that…" Banner searched for the nametag, and Tony held it up, "…Gary. Are you going through there?" he asked, pointing at the door that leads to where the original Gary worked at.
The yelling stopped and the two very annoyed teammates entered the living room, and unsurprisingly- they both looked pissed.
Iron Man fully faced him now, too distracted by the captain to notice that Hawkeye was no longer in his eyesight. "Oh look! It's my favorite boy-band!" He shouted "oh, hey Widow, didn't see you there. Anyways, will you sign my repulsors?" Iron Man flew closer to them, and Steve could hear Hawkeye on the comms telling him that he was in a good position to shoot.
"Whoa, there, Banner, I'm really happy to see you again, I don’t think seeing the other half of you is quite necessary." He said, his hands held in front of him with caution as if he was trying to calm an animal down.
"You don’t happen to know where the exit is, do you?" he asked theoretically, even though he guessed the god knew more then he let on.
When the kid almost drank the motor oil beside him, Tony put a stop to that nonsense and sent him to bed.
She shook her head mentally while frowning, and gave him the file. She hid almost every bit of information before she came over, and left only the important parts- the thing that an engineer like him would most likely find useful.
(A possibility that chilled Steve to the bone, he actually shuddered at the thought of a limp suit in his arms, completely lifeless and silent-), and the other possibility- the second and last one, the one which he preferred yet tried to avoid altogether. A possibility, where the Avengers did win over Iron Man, but instead of killing him on the spot will bring him to justice, jail maybe- or again, death or his actions.
Really, the man looked to be more and more peaceful at heart each fight they had. He didn't attack anyone on the team, only striking when he had to. And for some reason, Steve could almost see himself fighting side by side with the man, sharing these stupid jokes he said and the probably meaningless flirts together.
"You're very observant, buddy. But I don’t know about you, I am very hungry right now. C'mon, let's go make some sandwiches. Harley, wanna join us?"
She groaned in annoyance. "We don’t have to see whatever meaningless tricks you got this time, Clint, so this better be important." She finished, and just before Clint could tell her that, actually, everything he does is important and majestic, Steve joined the fuss-
Steve threw his shield at Iron Man, missing only because he dodged it with perfect timing. Damn this suit and its sensors, this could have been a lot easier if he had hit the man.
"I'm so sorry Dr. Banner, are you okay?" he asked, trying to help the scientist he just knocked down up on his feet.
The Avengers were called, and as they never planned anything too special for their next encounter with Iron Man, they fell into the same positions they had on a regular team mission-
Steve believed Iron Man was a good person at heart, and for the moment-, almost nothing could change that thought.
And when she was too stressed from her job (dealing with Avengers, SHIELD AND SI could be so fucking exhausting, really) –she turned to stress about her private life.
Well, yeah, he could've easily flown back home, but where's the fun in that? Besides, Peter was sleeping at Ned's place and Harley was doing the same with his friends, so there wouldn't be anything else to do at home anyway.
He was very glad though, that the encounter with the Avengers earlier today at one of Stane Industries' facilities hasn't turned into a big fight, or else he would have missed the party entirely, and that's without including the bruises and injuries.
And yet, this is it: this is what people do. He's traveled so far, away and away, with no direction. Nothing but the dream, only but the dream. Now, it appears to be half-baked ambitions. He suspects this is it, this is the best the world can have: trite, boring, everyday life.
He grabbed Tony’s tie and pulled him for a kiss. Wrapping his hand on the silky red tie, he ran his fingers through Tony’s hair, pulling softly. His fingers made their way to the back of his skull and Steve felt the ridges of the scar on his head.
He chokes in his shock and glances away. He wants nothing more than to face Tony head on, but he can’t look into his eyes. Not yet.
Natasha caught his eye when he stepped out of the kitchen with a bowl of chips and hummus. She offered a small smile, looking proud, even though there’s no reason to be. Maybe it’s because he showered and shaved his unruly beard.
Tony pats his back pocket, likely looking for cash, and Steve’s just about to tell him that it’s rather insulting, Victoria waves him off with a raised eyebrow. “You worked on the car, this is them paying you back. I’m no delivery service.”
“Hush.” It kisses Tony’s forehead and leads him to the settee. “Maybe you’ll never realize you were too good for him.”
One hundred and seventy-seven countries versus Steve Rogers. Governments rose and fell, administrations came and went, but the ideals of the people, what values make his country, was immovable.
“Sam Wilson, you’ve been remiss on fucking your boyfriend outdoors. We’ll have a talk about that later. But now, go away because Steve needs to keep sucking me off.”
Steve offers him a final peck on the mouth before reaching an egg. He cracks it on the side of the pan and they watch it sizzle for a moment before adding two more. The yolks are bright yellow, almost like the gold of the armor.
Her hair’s still thick, but there were more grays peppered in her red locks, especially on her temple. He wondered in the past year how much of Tony’s hair would have turned gray.
“How could you—” Mayor Danvers repeats again and again, a group of women are holding her up, disgust and confusion on their faces.
He takes a final drag from his cigarette and makes the move to toss it out when Natasha grabs his wrist and takes it from him. She stubs the butt on the case and pockets the remains. “What happened to your manners? Tony would kill us both for littering.”
There are only six returnees, as the paper’s taken to calling them. Parker. Drew. Lawson. Barnes. Rhodes. Rogers.
“She was your friend. An Avenger — she was,” Tony cries, unable to finish the words, failing to explain how Tigra found out about his identity the same day Cap did, how Tigra apologized for being terrified and letting them all down and how Steve applauded her strategy, and her confusion at finding Tony and Thor —
“Make space in that big heart of yours to love another human being.” Tony pulled Steve into the building. They made their way into the showers, stripping efficiently and washing the grime from their bodies.
Veranke stops struggling, she smirks, and Tony has no doubt that It, Steve, whoever he is, Pitt'o Nili. A man with so many names, is an excellent fighter, just like his Steve.
That’s what losing Tony felt like: perpetual suspension and dizziness. He wasn’t even crying anymore. Steve was tired of crying.
He yanked himself away from her grip, pushing his body further into the bed. She grabbed his forearms and dug her fingers on the nails until they surpassed the soft issue and lodged into his bone.
No, that’s wrong. Steve will soften the punches. If they ever come to killing each other at the end of this, he hopes it’ll be in Steve’s arms. What a way to die.
“How about that, Tony?” Steve asks, peering over the man. They’re nearly the same height, but Tony’s still blocked by the truck’s hood.
Sheriff Red Wolf tips his hat towards Tommy. “The kid was just telling me that they found some footprints in the dam.”
Tony knows Steve’s body like he knows the armor. Steve’s about to come. He moans, opens his eyes. The first thing he sees is the red of Steve’s lips, the pink hue of his cheekbones, and the blue of his eyes. “Oh, Tony, fuck, sweetheart, Tony. Tony. Tony.”
Steve knows he’ll miss the longer summer days when he and Morgan take the horses through the property, but he has the winters to look forward to. He and Tony spend hours on the sofa, watching TV, chatting about Peter and the papers he’s been publishing.
“Well, that’s fine by me, kid, but you’ll have to ask your father about that.” He points at Tony with a shrug.
No matter how many wars they waged against other human beings, no one wanted to spend their days alone.
Steve grinned as Morgan went for the middle of the bed and grabbed the bowl of fresh blueberries. Peter, more somber than his siblings, sat beside Steve on the end of the bed. They all squeezed together as Steve began plating the breakfast. Morgan grabbed the carnation and twisted its ends off.
He stops when he catches Tony’s duffel bag. It’s still there, right where he left it. It’s zippers wide open to reveal neatly folded clothes and several pairs of rolled up socks.
“Yeah, she’ll like that,” Steve started at the abandoned garden and mentally listed some of the items he’ll need to cultivate it.
I caught you, Steve. Tied you up, too. Do you remember your safe word? Come on, let me joke, Steve. You're dead and you'll never leave this. Let the joke land, alright?  But it doesn't last long. Goddamnit, Steve, is every version of you such a straight shooter?
“Mine too, and so are you.” Steve brought their intertwined fingers to Tony’s chest. He needed to feel the heartbeat, demanding that it kept beating, strumming that familiar pattern.
Tony presses their intertwined fingers to his mouth and bites. Steve imagines that the reason Tony is biting down on his knuckles so hard is because he’s trying not to scream Steve’s name because Steve is fucking him so good. Steve just wants to hear it. Tony would call him
Rumiko catches his eyes for a moment and then glances at his dick with a smile that’s all teeth and gums.
Steve turned him over with a grin and kissed his neck. The warm water washed over them, soaking their heads. Steve ducked down so Tony could wash his hair with those expert fingers.
Frustration and grief were Captain America’s old friends. He knew them in the ways men made friends with horrible, awful things and believed they loved them anyway.
Tony smiled, lightly squeezing Steve’s hands. They used to be so strong—carrying soldering irons, building machines, now, they were still the same, but the veins on his wrists and the back of his hands were more pronounced. Tony’s lost so much weight.
His son looked at him questioningly, tilting his head down with an encouraging smile. As if his father needed it. No, it shouldn’t be like that. Steve forced his lips into a smile. A mimicry of the real thing.
Harley eyed them cautiously, then pulled Morgan’s feet up before sliding it under him. He faced Steve with searching eyes, then dropped his head on Steve’s chest.
He thinks that he might have put an end to that after Siberia. After he took half the team and Tony remained here.
“Nah, we don’t. You’re not SHIELD, anymore, baby. Unless you wanna go back to your ex and ditch the Avengers?” Tony walked over and clapped him on the shoulder.
I repeat what he tells me, word for word. I tell him about Joanna, then Rumiko, and make myself cry when I speak about them, because I’m supposed to be vulnerable. This is part of the role.
He’s just here to make sure Tony’s alright. Then, maybe he’ll introduce himself. Stone and the woman lean against Tony, light up a cigarette, and laugh. It’s vapid. This isn’t Tony Stark’s scene. No, the Tony Stark that Steve read about is a genius with a heart of gold. A genuinely good man. That’s hard to find these days. While Steve understands his grief, he disagrees with how long Tony’s partying life has been going. He’s afraid that Tony might spiral into full blown substance abuse.
“Why?” There’s many reasons. Tony barks out a short laugh. “I haven’t seen you in years. You get that right?”
Morgan makes a face and hastily deposits the paper bag filled with soap, then gets the other bag and grabs her child sized burrito, courtesy of Iz. “Yours is in the bag, dad.”
When Steve asks Morgan what her father is up to, she just grins and says, “Pops, pops, pops, dad made me promise not to tell, so please don’t ask me because I might slip and I don’t want to upset him.”
Steve takes a seat, and his knees knock Tony’s own under the table. He heaves a heavy sigh. “If you’re going to be like this —“
Steve stared at the photograph every morning. Somedays, he wanted to turn it over, face the frame down so he could stop trying to relive that day.
“Peter.” He scrubbed his eyes, got up, and sat beside Peter. Steve pulled his son for a side hug and dropped a kiss to his head.
On Christmas night, they eat a small meal made by Tony following Iz’s recipe for chile relleno and beans. He’s fallen in love with Iz’s place, and spends some weekdays hanging around the restaurant and following Iz through the kitchen. Iz relates a time when Tony simply snagged an apron and started serving their patrons. Steve kisses him that night, falling beside him, teasing, as his hard working man.
“Your dad will always be with you. With us,” Steve swallowed, squeezing the kids’ shoulders. He looked at the set of photographs on the wall, chest heaving. “It’s true. Everyone will say this to you. He lives on through you, through us, through our memories. There’s a million and one things I could say to you kids. I’ll tell you all about your father. Everything he
He ignores his shaky fingers and Steve is gracious enough to not say anything. Tony pushes his hair back for the second time that night, hand massaging Steve’s scalp. He presses their foreheads together. Breathes. Inhales Steve.
If only life is easy. Straight-forward and simple, no catastrophe every Tuesday afternoon. A quiet, uncomplicated life.
The song changes to something electronic. Steve’s never heard of it but people all around him start banging their heads and shuffling. Some man gets behind him, getting a hand on his hip. Just as Steve’s about to tell him off, a woman pushes them into the living room. It’s dim with light strobes, sweaty bodies all around him. There’s sand everywhere and it’s like he’s back shooting in the desert, chewing on tobacco, and cursing his unit. Steve pushes to the corner of the room, tracking the movements all around him. Some people are dancing barefoot and up on the second floor, there’s people passing a bong.
“The kid working the shop said you can’t have Captain America without Iron Man.” Steve sipped his coffee again, not sure why he said that, it wasn’t even true. He saw that as a line in a newspaper, in passing. It was a sensationalist article about the Avengers coming together as a team during the Battle of New York. Steve pressed forward, setting the half-empty mug on the table. “Tony, do you want to wait until the morning to continue? Have a break? Catch some sleep, maybe?”
“I really do think you’ll love it. Being a father.” Tony turned the shower knobs and ducked his hair under the waters. He grabbed the soap and passed it to Steve without a word.
Steve waved at her, forced a smile to his face. “Sometimes I wish they didn’t look so much like him. But they’re the only thing about him that I have left.”
The woman and Stone put a hand on Tony, trying to pull him onto the dance floor. But Tony waves them away, instead, spinning on his seat and drinking from a red plastic cup. Just as Steve is about to approach, another man in a suit walks to Tony and starts a conversation. Tony is seemingly annoyed, rolling his eyes and pulling away from the man. While everyone is prancing half-naked and still wet from the beach, this man looks out of place with his suit jacket and slicked-back hair.
He hadn’t taken the subway since he was thirteen because his brain refused to erase the twist of her face and the piercing scream. When Tony walked the streets of New York, he avoided staring at subway entrances. Not even a glance to check where they led or what lines ran that street.
It’s a nice day. The sun rises steadily from the shorelines. It’s still winter, but it’s warm enough to be out. The soil beneath their feet is slightly damp from last night’s drizzle. The trees lining the property are a mix of bright yellows and dull oranges.
Tony grins and lets himself be picked up. He wipes his hands on his jeans and ruffles the kid’s hair. “No problem, kid.”
Tony stays silent, cataloguing the scuff on Steve’s boots, all the closed pouches on his utility belt, the determined frown on his face. There was a time when they walked the streets, shoulders brushing against each other, with the firm belief that they’d always be friends. Now, Tony doesn’t know if there’s anything left.
“And you still want to go on a road trip with me? Share the same space for weeks, months on end, even.” Tony’s eyebrows shoot up, as if he’s thinking out loud. “See the country.”
“It isn’t supposed to be like this.” He choked on the words, letting himself break down in the way he could never do in front of his kids. “He’s not the one that has to go on and keep on living. Fuck.”
“Steve, it’s gonna be a fight. Everyday is gonna be like preparing for battle. But you’ve done that your whole life and you can keep going.”
“Me too. But everything is awful and fucked.” Tony rubbed a hand over his face because he couldn’t keep looking at Steve. If Tony held their gazes any longer, he’d never look away. Instead, his eyes traced the crown molding on the corners of the room and followed it up the walls, past the puddle on the floor, the chipped sink, and up the mosaic ceiling.
