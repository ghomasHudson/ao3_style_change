“You know what I’ve been reading; your daughter has them memorised.”
Mrs Parker congratulated herself later when she did not point out that the nurse, who was plump to the point of being dumpy, did not seem to have terribly healthy eating habits, either. “It doesn’t matter how ‘healthy’ or good the food is for him if he won’t eat it or worse—if it just ends up in the toilet.”
“He was seeing how far the ashes flew as he raked a burning piece of paper from the fire,” she replied calmly, and it was my turn to be a bit taken aback.
“But you wish to raise it? That is a positive sign. You know that.”
Besides, I am the one with the campaign experience. He is not.
The second tin—a smaller one shaped like a stack of chocolate digestives—held an encouraging amount of cash. He took it all and replaced that tin.
“Why are you in such a mood?” I demanded.
“Clearly, yes—but there is no need for her to be. There are still so many children who, through no fault of their own, do not receive even the most basic of lessons.”
What he wanted to do was to change and sleep in the room next to his own, as he had done the night before. He would have been grateful to stretch out on his own bed. But now, it didn’t matter how exhausted he was. His brother wanted him to read to him, and, thrilled at the almost-words Sherlock had managed to form, was happy to do so.
“Begin?” I wondered, suspecting that I already knew what the dear lady had in mind. “You are going to teach her to read.”
“It’s not quite time for more medication, I’m afraid. I know your head hurts. How about a nice, cold cloth?” She rose and went to his brother’s en-suite bathroom.
I will not deny—I hoped that soon I would be kissing more than that, but at that moment I felt no urges except those of a comforting nature. My darling was battered and exhausted and withdrawn, and the only thing I wanted to do at that moment was to comfort him.
Finally, he had begun to show signs of fatigue and sighed somewhat gratefully as Solomon, with the books cradled in one muscular arm, guided him up the stairs back to the sofa in his brother’s bedroom and covered him with a soft blanket.
That was when the surveillance began. He had, by then, moved quietly and steadily up the invisible ladder that his life in the shadowy underside of “the government” had offered him. For the most part, he had been entirely—completely—undeniably and reliably—professional. Friendships, social obligations—even his parents never competed for his attention to his job. He himself did not have what might be considered a “personal” life—no companion or attachment of any description. He eschewed the trappings of emotions.
Sometimes they cut worse than a thousand knives.
“Oh, my poor darling. Is the water growing cold?” I turned on the hot tap.
[Sherlock’s distinct handwriting appears along the side of this paragraph; he has scrawled a collection of letters and numbers connected with lines—presumably a chemical formula—but it is in a very light pencil and difficult to discern.]
“Oh, yes. I believe that holiday shopping is a level of hell Dante did not cover.”
He didn’t reply.
“Of course.” What could he possibly have left to tell me?
“As you noted, I set out immediately. Mr. Bramsen had requested that I meet him in a rather clandestine spot.”
“He gets ahead of himself,” she explained, gratefully accepting it. “He’s not ‘Lock’s parent, but for some reason he thinks he’s better at it than we are. If he’s going to do that, he has to prove to me that he can offer something that we can’t.”
“Yes,” she pressed. “Let’s get you comfortable, all right?”
?” He sounded almost tearful and I felt a distinct stab of regret.
“’Thou shalt not lie with mankind, as with womankind: it is abomination.’ Leviticus, Chapter 18, verse 22,” he interjected. “It was a calculated risk. Mrs. Bloom’s rather sweeping accusations, particularly in her letter, led me to believe that she was outraged more by generalities than specifics, and that she relied more on hearsay and gossip than a strict reading and understanding of that particular good book.”
[The following piece was written during their confinement; it is in pencil.]
“She did not seem to understand the meaning of the word ‘clean’,” she sniffed. “My instructions were clear, but she chose to interpret them in a manner I found unsatisfactory.”
“Well, I will not judge you; you and he are both clearly doing enough of that. But perhaps it is, as you say, best if you do as he wishes and stay away for a day or two.” She sounded so horribly disappointed that I could not bear to look her in the face.
“He turned him away?”
“Well, is there a ship leaving for New York today?”
It was all untouched save the coffee.
His own reaction has been disturbing. He now seems completely unaware of his injury even as it obviously impedes his movements. He was impatient with my examination, of course, and then began to act as if the incident had never occurred.
If asked, Mrs. Hudson could of course not deny that we were not exactly
“It’s his skin. All the scars. I’m concerned that they’re causing him some pain.”
“And that is precisely what I do not understand!” he protested quite vehemently. I felt his back stiffen.
“It is meant to be, my love,” I told him sincerely, but I also paused again. “I had not thought about that—about Belinda,” I admitted.
“What’s
“Place an advertisement for another maid?”
He was tired now and not having any fun, so he walked over to the ostentatious black car, eliciting a sharp intake of breath on his brother’s part when he stumbled. He slid in and fell back against the seat, his eyes shut. He pulled off the hat and ran his fingers through his hair. His head ached.
“I...”
Sherlock was apparently finding the rather hideous Christmas jumper fascinating, his eyes fixed on it and his mouth tightly shut.
“But I desire it now, John. I have been composing you know I have been but I’ve gotten to a bit that I simply must play to work it all out and I wish to play it for you I wonder if Mycroft would like to hear it as well he has excellent taste in music hedoesnot gotoconcerts butIwishhewould heused to go toconcertsproperones not musichallperformances whichIknowisyour preferencedo youthinkIcouldhavemorepaperIsomehowuseditallup didyoubringpaperoranynewspapers itcouldevenbeyesterday’sIfindmyselfignorantofthedatewhyis that sometimesIdon’t care whatthe date is itdoesn’tmuchmattertome doesitmatter? Doesitmattertoyou? Ifitmatterstoyou I willtry harderto knowtheday youwere gonehalf theday it’snearlydark—”
The gardener rose and, dusting off his knees, remarked, “He was out here on his own.”
“Never mind,” I told him. “Go to sleep.”
“Precisely,” I managed. My face was growing hot.
“I’m not sure. I just arrived,” the nurse offered, startled.
“We have,” I affirmed.
“Mmm. It was July. It had not been terribly oppressive, but one evening, one could not help but notice that, as the sun went down, the temperature began going
“That’s one of those ‘one of each’ things, isn’t it?”
I laughed aloud. He was so very droll; how could I get irritated? I retrieved his Persian slipper and prepared my pipe. I lit a match and got it going before opening the next note, which had been tucked into the embroidered slipper—I was careful to brush the bits of tobacco back into it rather than on the floor.
For it had just occurred to him—if their little “game” was revealed, who would be the more humiliated? There was no denying that he had been pretty out of it when the others had arrived. They knew that Victor tended to control what he took—often dosing him too heavily or withholding, depending on his mood and Sherlock’s need; it wouldn’t be the first time he had given him too much. So, if his naked body, tied with what were undeniably Victor’s own ties, was revealed—and it would only take a twitch of the duvet—would they think for one moment that he had voluntarily gotten himself into that situation?
“No, Sherlock, I did not mean that as a criticism. It is perfectly fine.” I continued rubbing his thin back (I could teach an anatomy lesson using him instead of a cadaver—I could name every bone—he really needs feeding up).
you just means that I am a healthy man with healthy desires and you, my love, are sometimes quite irresistible.” I kissed his ear again, this time lingering so he could feel my breath on his neck. “And now that I have awoken those desires in you through those most delicious activities in which we indulge,” I murmured, “can you honestly tell me that you do not sometimes find those urges undeniable?” I gave his neck a soft, warm kiss.
And he needed to use the loo.
Because that was the most awkward part, wasn’t it? Sherlock’s return was still a secret.
Finally—finally—they were done, at least for the moment. The calm of the warm bath and comfortable clothes had been shattered by his first sight of the medical personnel. Sherlock was terrified—absolutely, heart-breakingly, violently terrified. Anthea winced as he slammed into a table in his attempt to get away. He was panting and even under the bruises on his face she could see that he was growing rapidly paler.
Nothing came between him and his position. Ever. Except…
And why was it so entertaining?
Through determination—and thinking about Sherlock’s most recent experiment, which had involved him determining exactly how long it took for bits of flesh (in this case, pork) to become maggot-and-insect-ridden, reeking, disgusting messes whilst in different situations (covered, uncovered, and so on)—I somehow managed to get myself under control, dressed, and into our sitting room, where the obvious duress of our client wiped the last vestiges of my predicament from my head—for the moment, anyway.
“No, he is much more likely to feel the cold,” she agreed. She looked out the window. “At least it seems as if we will see a change soon enough. That breeze is promising.”
Mycroft wasn’t sure if the rubber band, the paper clip, and the drinking straw that had been found in the pocket of the shredded jeans his brother had been wearing would be of any help. When he had been picked up, they were quite literally the only things that he had had in his possession.
“Whatever do you mean?” I obediently prodded.
“Hm. Nice,” he commented, holding the glass up to the firelight.
He considered this for a moment and I slid my hand under his shirt again. “Oh! Dress myself properly!”
“No, what?”
[At this point the doctor apparently paused in his writing. As so often happens, when he takes up his pen again, his handwriting—which had grown a bit ragged with emotion—is more firm and decisive.]
She had only meant to explore some of the more
“Yes, Sherlock—John. Dr John Watson.” He stopped himself from saying more; he wanted to see what else his brother could produce.
My darling placed her on her bed as easily as if she were a doll.
“Will I have a scar?”
“It has always been,” he admitted. “My… family tried to discourage it; to teach me to behave, but I was quite stubborn. I saw no reason not to state the truth at all times, even when it was hurtful.”
Keep it simple; keep it non-threatening. She knew that. “I’ve already ordered some of his favourite foods.”
But then he gave me a small smile and explained. “Your moustache tickles,” he reported, “and you missed that spot that you always do when you shave.” He grabbed my hand and held it against his own cheek. “But my face is smooth for days at a time.”
“I will help. Would that make it easier? Will you try?”
Sherlock chuckled and puffed on his pipe. “Not quite. But in order to do his job effectively, he must remain completely anonymous—which is why I have not mentioned his existence and now you are not to, either.”
running
“Watson? How many of those men do you have with you?”
“Is there cake?” he asked, and I was not certain if I wished to laugh or to cry—for he spoke in his old voice, and it was steady and sensible and calm.
I glanced at the door to Sherlock’s bedroom. I had left him in bed for the entire day and would not grow concerned until teatime. I did, of course, look in on him regularly, and he seemed to be sleeping soundly. It was not surprising, considering how hard he had pushed himself.
“Right...” John said dimly, momentarily mesmerized by the droplet of wine—lucky, lucky wine. He cleared his throat, took a good mouthful of beer, and had to clear his throat again.
“You held an unhealthy obsession with attending your club.”
“I cannot say,” I waffled.
But he smiled sadly as he accepted the book thrust at him with one shaking hand and sank down onto the sofa next to his baby brother.
“You joined her at the prison once,” he offered, stammering.
Last evening was the most remarkable in that it was completely not remarkable. We dined with Mycroft Holmes. We did not dress, as he was not receiving anyone but ourselves and so did not see reason in it, but we did tidy ourselves and at the appropriate hour walked out into the corridor through the now-unlocked door and descended to the fine dining room. Sherlock looked handsome and well. He ate a normal dinner and—I am still somewhat astounded—was allowed a knife with which to cut into the roast.
“Where did you go?” I found that hearing him address the issue as he would a case had a calming effect on me; my heart rate began to slow. If there was anything on this earth on which I could rely, it was the detective’s great brain and gift for investigation.
“Mrs. Hudson,” I requested when she had made an appearance, “Mr. Holmes is not feeling well. Could you possibly make him some broth?”
The taller man, who was also slightly older, glared at him with such intensity he began to feel a prickle of sweat forming on his skin. “Get him off the floor, for God’s sake.”
“That I did,” he murmured, and with one graceful motion he sank down in front of me and I looked down to observe his nimble, white fingers as they unfastened my trousers and skilfully freed my rigid prick from them and with one final glance up at me, his eyes glistening with mirth, his beautiful mouth engulfed me, his strong, thin fingers gripped my hips, and he drew from me
Mycroft frowned. He didn’t like his demeanour. The usually almost ebullient man was decidedly downcast. “Oh?” He attempted to sound neutral.
He was Catholic and the eighth of nine children. Not that he had told them that, of course, but Mycroft couldn’t help noting the facts. He wondered if Sherlock still automatically observed and catalogued facts like that about people. Not knowing what was going on in his brother’s head was becoming increasingly frustrating.
“Oh! I know. He’s making a compass,” the nurse exclaimed. “Watch.”
4) But what
“I told you—I forgot. I was reading in bed when I recalled a piece in the newspaper I wished to re-examine, and I went out to find it. I did find it, but then I began reading it and I forgot.”
“What was his reaction?”
prove a great many things that she had written in her letter to me. We had already discussed certain elements of the situation during our conversation with the Blooms, but now I considered the situation methodically, murmuring my ruminations as I continued to rub my darling’s thin back.
dirty?” I demanded. “Did it soak through your trousers?”
Ridiculous man.
How are we to manage that? Sherlock, put my pipe back.”
Could she?
“I did it—
WANTED— Temporary MAID OF ALL WORK, for two gentlemen and housekeeper. Live out. No laundry. Good personal reference. Apply 221B, Baker Street, after twelve.
Not an observation—an accusation.
The thin man seated at the dining room table observed her keenly.
The truth is that I do not truly understand it myself. I do not associate it with any particular or general memory of my own childhood. My mother might have held me in her lap when I was very young, but I have no specific recall of it, and my father most certainly never indulged either of us boys in such a way.
“Shall I—”
“Now, before you have your pudding, you will change into your pyjamas, and after you’re done, it’s lights out. I am not tolerating this topsy-turvy schedule. A man in your condition needs regular meals and a full night’s sleep.”
Afterward, Molly wasn’t sure if she had been more startled by the fact that there was someone behind her, suddenly reflected in the mirror mounted inside the locker door—
He was having a bit of trouble with his balance and couldn’t manage his usual pace at all, but maybe that was a good thing—he’d be less noticeable that way, wouldn’t he?
“You always know,” she shot back sharply.
Reseating myself, I felt brave enough to tackle the issue head-on. “Mrs. Hudson, my dear, I know that this is probably a very inappropriate and rather unlikely conversation for a tenant to have with his landlady, but I am also a medical doctor—and your friend. I would like to consider myself your friend. Is that acceptable?”
Matilda introduced herself and Christopher excused himself. “Good luck,” he stated by way of parting.
He does not, as I have described, simply become still and thoughtful. This is an anguish that seeps out of his very pores. He lies on the sofa in our homely rooms in clothing he cannot bring himself to change—
“And what did you discover? Wait. I cannot continue conversing in the darkness; it is so oppressive.” Having done so many times, I was able to make my way across the room and re-light the gas. I kept it low, but felt much better when I could see him. I returned to the bed and sat at the edge of the mattress. “There. Now, what information did you seek, and what did you learn?”
We do, of course, not make these assumptions at other times of the day. When darkness falls, no matter how bright and abundant the gas lights are, the streets become ominous. Every mews and alley seems to harbour the lowest of criminals, lurking just out of sight and ready to burst out of the shadows, brandishing a gleaming knife. When someone is out at night, unless they are a police constable, they are a victim—or a suspect.
“So,” he summed up, suddenly returning to the thrust of our conversation, “the image that I project—an eccentric-to-the-point-of-lunatic consulting detective is difficult enough to manage without adding in anything about what I wear or what music I listen to.”
And now that I have written all of this I still cannot explain to myself the reason I offered him my lap in the first place.
“Christ, Holmes. Move over,” Paul said. Sherlock looked at Victor in panic.
We had tea and cake and although he is clearly not wholly himself yet—the movements of his eyes as they dart about the room and the trembling of his hands betray him as still being under the influence of his horrid illness—he seemed so much more like his old self than I had witnessed in—how long have we been in his brother’s house?
I am, however, forever grateful that you did not. Even when I was being so horrid, you must know that I loved you and love you still so very much.]
Finally, the recipient of the dressing-down had emerged. John, who had been—all right, so he had been making a show of checking some records with Mary as an excuse to not return to his office—deliberately looked down at the reception computer monitor. “Is that it?” he had asked, gesturing.
Why did that phrase make his heart beat faster?
The bowl of consommé that he thrust away from himself (and off the edge of the table) the day before had not, fortunately, stained the carpet overmuch.
He looked at me with the briefest of moments of puzzlement before discerning my intent. “Oh! I was… examining the window, was I not?” He strode over to my window, and with a rather teasing smile, first allowed his dressing gown to slip off his shoulders to the floor and then began to “examine” the frame. “Did I crouch down to look at the floor?” he wondered, doing just that. I could see his lean body as it moved beneath the light fabric of his trousers.
“Watson,” he said as he rose from his chair, “I believe we are done here.”
“Take up the maid’s responsibilities until we get a new one?”
far too much vinegar
“I myself make a distinction between ‘ethical’ and ‘virtuous’ behaviours. I believe that ‘ethical’ ways of thinking are concerned with doing no harm—as our good doctor here can attest by his profession of the Hippocratic Oath. By simply avoiding certain injurious behaviours, one can be considered ethical, and therefore moral. Virtuous acts, on the other hand, require a more...
“You see, my brother has been thus afflicted with these periods of melancholia since he was a young man. He is equally prone to fits of mania. It is an unnamed malady, but our mother suffered in the same manner. Based on my experience with both of them, there is very little that anyone can do to alleviate their distress—and please understand that it is truly and deeply distressing.”
“You really dragged me to one of the busiest places in the city at the busiest time of year to actually shop for gifts? No other reason?”
“Yes,” he admitted, his breath puffing across my chest.
“There you are, my sweet! Are you all right?”
“It is perfectly fine, Doctor,” the impeccably-dressed man said rather sharply. “My brother needs me here.”
“Perhaps I will take some coffee,” his brother added.
The sight that greeted me caused my throat to tighten and my eyes to prick with tears. My friend was but a shadow of his usual self.
I felt positively ill. “Good Lord, Sherlock,” I somehow managed; my throat tight. “What was he trying to do?” And then it occurred to me and the realisation left me gasping for breath. “Sherlock… Doctor Roylott’s abominable cruelty towards his daughters—stepdaughters—he plotted their
. And all of the other…
What was his fault was what he was wearing—or more precisely, what he was
“Sadly, this is completely normal behaviour for him,” the older brother replied. “He once went to Buckingham Palace like that.”
I raised his beautiful face to mine with a gentle finger under his chin.
“No?”
Now the nurse’s alarm chimed, and she bent over her patient. “Sherlock?” she said firmly. “I need you to wake up for a bit. Come on.”
“What does it look like I am doing?” Mrs Hudson replied drily.
“Of course. What’re we having?”
Dave slowly took a few slow steps forward, not wishing to alarm the man again.
“Tell me again how often this happens to him, and how long these fits last.”
“I am not ill, doctor,” she replied.
Get away
Mycroft was ready to snap at this comment, but changed his mind. “No, that’s understandable,” he agreed with a sigh. “There is very little about my brother’s behaviour that is explicable. Was that what you wished to discuss with me?”
After that, he became quite incoherent and his brother and I spent the remainder of the drive bodily preventing him from jettisoning himself from the carriage.
“I should have been more diligent in my questioning,” she admitted, “but it is growing more and more uncommon—or so I thought. It simply did not occur to me. I feel quite horrid about the way I found out—me thrusting that wretched book under her nose. I do wish she had told me.”
Malcolm, who had stopped his car and come running back when he realised what was going on behind him, now went ahead of them to hold the doors open and turn on lights, and it was he who discovered the nurse, slumped in the armchair in Sherlock’s room and drooling on the shoulder of her uniform. Without pausing, he grabbed the back of the chair and dragged it out into the hallway, then dashed back in as the four men arrived with their flailing, cursing burden.
He nodded, and I gently drew him out of his bed. I found him trousers and a dressing gown and covered his cold legs and arms, then helped him to the sitting room. I considered going downstairs to speak to Mrs. Hudson, but I had promised not to leave him and I did not wish to, so I rang the bell.
“Yes, of course. When he is afflicted in this manner, I see to it that he is safe whilst we wait for his eventual return to reason.”
He nodded again.
Whether or not it was a good idea, he simply could not bear having him there any longer.
“No, you will not,” his brother stated in a low, firm voice.
make Sherlock squirm, pulling subtly on his ligatures, was this: He had been stupid enough to let Victor overpower him. He had been stoned enough that he wasn’t even aware of what was happening, and he had just let it happen. He was not in control of the situation.
Greg watched as he pushed the door open and unfolded himself from the car—and promptly passed out cold. It was rather horrifying to watch; as the DL fumbled with his own door he just went straight down. “Shit, Sherlock!” he shouted as he dashed around the front of the car and threw himself onto his knees next to the younger man. He was alarmingly pale and out cold. “Hey,” he muttered as he patted one gaunt cheek. “Come on. Come back to me.”
I had already discarded the concept of supper. I knew that he would not eat nor drink, and I admit that I had no heart to do so either. I could have a drink once we reached Baker Street.
Now, of course, I see the signs of these impending moods, often before he does, and so am prepared for his sudden bursts of temper during an investigation; his sullen refusal of a case.
It has been a hellish afternoon.
I am, every moment, grateful to our host. When we arrived, the rooms had been, as promised, stripped to the bare minimum—all breakables removed. However, there are books (those are deemed harmless for the most part unless he throws them) and pencils and writing paper (Mycroft explained that they have learned not to provide him with pens or ink). Everything is kept fresh and airy—the bedding is rather exquisite. Meals arrive punctually, delivered by one of the very serious young footmen; letters likewise (all from Mrs Hudson—one each day, in which she faithfully records any visitors and more mundane issues regarding the drains and whatnot—all of which Sherlock takes very seriously, sometimes re-reading a letter several times and then writing a very earnest if rambling response). There are always clean towels and shirts and stockings.
“Did he injure you?” Mycroft asked anxiously.
Our overnight adventure proceeded much as I described it, omitting, of course, some of the more personal details, including the way in which we occupied our time at the Crown Inn whilst awaiting Miss Stoner’s signal. We engaged a bed-room and sitting-room, as I have written, and it was exactly the sort of arrangement which we enjoyed. The sitting-room had two very nice, comfortable chairs, which I positioned by the window so we could watch the avenue gate. I looked over at Sherlock as Roylott shouted at the poor lad fumbling with the gates, and was alarmed at my darling’s expression, which had become haunted again.
Chips positively swimming in vinegar.
“Do not be too harsh with him. He has been quite upset about all this fuss.”
He whimpered as his wet pyjamas were removed. He hadn’t meant to. It was an accident. Daddy never got angry about accidents. The man helping him didn’t seem angry, either. So maybe it was not so bad. He would try to be a big boy and remember to ask if he needed Daddy to help him with the toilet.
She suddenly could not look at me, glancing down at her work-worn hands instead.
What was that about a blanket fort?
No, no voices. No footsteps. Good.
“So, I asked her directly, ‘What is upsetting you?’ And can you believe… well, I most certainly did not anticipate her reply—not in the slightest.”
exhausted.
“Who are they from?” he demanded of the doctor, who had risen and was carefully conveying the stack of presents—the gift bag dangling from his finger—to his chair.
“Mycroft!” Her exclamation startled him; his mind had been wandering. “What did you phone about?”
He poked at it rather insistently.
“Which bed shall you have?” he queried. His voice was quiet and—dare I say it—almost timid.
“Yes. I made myself useful, of course—there is always work to do in such a household, and the other servants were perfectly happy with the extra hand. It was a pleasant place, really. Mr Simpson was quite easy to work for. Very tidy. Did not entertain much. Worked in The City most days. But he married recently, and the new Mrs Simpson had her own maid, so Mr Simpson assisted me in finding a new position.”
That was not a reassuring reply.
When they retrieved him and got him back home, he would have to check the medical report.
I know…
He reached to the top of the fridge and took the tin shaped like a giant custard cream biscuit down. He already knew what was in it, but he glanced inside anyway. Should he? Did he need it? He had once had a sort of fascination with handguns, but for some reason the idea of holding one now gave him an uneasy, sort of queasy feeling—as if he had been doing a great deal of that at some point and was tired of it. He re-covered the tin and put it back.
“Fibbing,” she offered sternly. “Oh, hello, darling. I’m on with Mycroft.”
John Watson really is a remarkable man,
I am not bragging to say that, more often than not, this approach is the most effective I have applied. My darling is able to sit for longer and longer periods. His murmuring and his constant motion slows and gradually—very gradually—fades away.
them. I have no idea what one thing has to do with the other.”
No, that was not correct. I did have one more piece of information—and it was one that I had inadvertently taken away with me. I reached into my coat pocket. Yes, the sheet on which I had been inventorying those mysterious items was there. I recalled now that I had thrust it in as I had hurried out of the house. It was rather crumpled. I smoothed it out and examined it.
Yes, of course John had put up the tree himself—and decorated it. And then strung fairy lights in the windows and across the mirror over the fireplace. He had done a lot of teetering on a kitchen chair until it dawned on him to borrow Mrs Hudson’s step stool.
Matilda smiled. “My boys are so wicked—always telling me that they don’t want ‘rabbit food.’” Mrs Parker smiled back.
“I thought... the decorations or something. Something in common you’d noticed at all the crime scenes.”
He had pulverized the tablet, and the resulting powder was barely noticeable, particularly after he added the milk.
“I don’t know how you did it, mate.” The head of security extended a hand.
it’s just a trick just a magic trick just magic it’s not me not you not us not forever we’re forever not this we’re not this we’re brighter than this brighter than the sun
“That’s terrific, love! Now you can be a policeman like Uncle Greg.” John found that his throat was suddenly tight; his voice rough.
“We will—this very night,” I professed. “As soon as we see the signal, we shall positively fly there, and I am certain that we will be in time to prevent some subtle and horrible crime.”
. She shook her head in disagreement over the list of his medications; according to her, he should have been taking several in addition to what he was already receiving, each of which contained no fewer than four syllables. She groaned about the notes regarding his freedom from any sort of schedule. She also tsked tsked over Mrs Parker’s protests about what she had requested (ordered) for dinner.
“Who says anything is wrong… all right…” He sighed. “Dad, I suggest you put me on speaker. And perhaps you both should sit down.”
I took another drink, then a deep breath. “I do not mean to bring up unpleasant memories, my dear lady, but I thought that it was cholera that took them.”
“He’s sleeping. Everyone’s sleeping.”
“Please come to bed. I need to be kissed. –Sherlock.”
coming.
“Mr Holmes has delved into cookery—he has made a very nice almond cake,” I reminded her.
He was across the room and back with the decanter and glasses in a single breath. He sat at my feet and carefully poured each of us a glass. “All right?” he asked as he guided mine into my shaking hand.
“Then let us get straight to the root of the matter,” she sniffed.
“He was aware that it is temporary one, was he not?” I was a bit concerned; we had not made plans for a permanent placement.
“Yes, I am afraid so. It was not long after that day that they were both struck down with that terrible illness. They both succumbed so quickly. I am thankful for that, you know. Others suffer—linger—for ages with it, or they are left so horribly disfigured.”
God. What if he never regained…
And moving far too quickly for someone who was still in such terrible shape, he was suddenly behind his brother’s chair, the knife that lay beside Mycroft’s plate up against his throat.
“You were so very remarkable and brave this morning,” I told him, whispering against his temple. “I forget how strong you are sometimes. But what a horrible, abominable man. He has you so very disturbed, my love,” I commented. “I know that bullies of that nature are particularly abhorrent to you.”
“Burn himself?” Lilly asked in alarm. “Would he really do that?”
“As I have said before, there was a time in my life when I thought it was my role in life to uphold the law—without question,” I offered.
In short, you were, in all respects, an abominable husband. And this brings me directly to my original purpose.
Finally, my meal complete, I returned to my empty and lonely room. What was I going to do? Usually when I absented myself from Baker Street it was my choice and often it was the peace of solitude that I sought. This was so far from my current situation I was at a loss. I was in no mood to write up any cases, and it occurred to me that I could not have written anything about our latest one because Sherlock had never gotten around to telling me the resolution of his investigation. It had taken him such a short period of time and he had not seemed terribly impressed with himself, so it must not have been very intriguing. Mundane, he had said. Perhaps painfully obvious.
The only other things that allowed him to do that were cases, experiments, and cocaine.
“I have parents.”
“Mrs Parker?”
“I’ve selected several books, but my eyes are bothering me. I can’t seem to read without giving myself a headache,” he explained.
Christopher was back. Mycroft was impressed with him, as he was with a few of the other nurses. He seemed genuinely concerned with the welfare of his patient, with a compassionate manner and a gentle touch. After the situation with his brother that night, he had somehow managed to get a few hours’ sleep, but had been summoned to his office before the sun was completely up. He tried focusing on the situation at hand, but even while placating yet another highly-visible victim of some sort of blackmailer—who of course the victim would not identify—he had felt a strong urge to return to his brother’s room to see how he was doing. He was lying on the bed. The room was darkened. His eyes were heavy-lidded and his features slack.
She let him slide his thumb into his mouth.
Now to find something for Lestrade.
Two hours later, he woke whimpering.
The shaking was driving him mad. Why was he shaking? He seemed to remember eating
“So, you said there is more.” I did not particularly wish to hear more, but I was beginning to understand that there was a necessity to his confessions. He had borne this sorrow and terror on his own since boyhood. I could not allow him to bear it by himself for one more moment. “Please, my love, tell me so that I may try to take some of your pain away.”
He was gratified to receive a piercing look and then, rather unbelievably considering the circumstances, a small smile. “Correct,” the young man stated with some admiration. “What gave me away?”
“You know… John,” she repeated as calmly as she could.
My darling headed out, looking more apprehensive at the thought of purchasing pigs’ trotters than he ever had when contemplating the end of a gun barrel pointed at his head. We remained still until we heard the street door open and shut, and then gave into laughter. He could be so very ridiculous at times.
There was a quiet knock. The door to the corridor was open—Mrs. Hudson had left it that way when she had brought up the breakfast tray, obviously noting that we were, for once, decently dressed and decently engaged. Our landlady now stood there.
Winifred had been observing her patient with concern. While under the influence of the sedative, he had slept, his breaths slow and deep. But now it was wearing off, and, although still asleep, he was becoming agitated. She turned on the bedside lamp.
“How do you know that?” I realised the connection between the crime scene we had been examining and his decidedly untidy pursuits.
He remained silent.
“To sleep in?”
“I don’t mind being bare.”
“Sherlock, stop this.” The nurse’s voice was firm and even. “You are going to hurt someone.”
I do recall, however, even as I pleaded with my friend to forgive me for keeping his violin away from him, realising that he was—marginally, at least—better. His speech, although rapid, had none of the jumbled and rambling nature that had coloured so much of our recent days. He did not stray from his subject; he remained focused and in fact repulsed our attempts to divert him. His movements, too, were closer to his usual high energy than the jittery, inelegant motion he had been displaying.
I know that he does not sleep—well, he might manage three hours in a night—because I cannot bear the thought of him being even one room away from me, so we use one room as our sitting room and the other to which to retire. It is touching how hard he tries to rest with me. He seems more concerned that I sleep than himself—but when I do lie down he sometimes tries to emulate me. This is similar to his lesser attacks of mania, with which I became familiar shortly after joining him in our homely rooms. He obediently changes into nightclothes (he often becomes distracted whilst doing so and I have to prompt him to don his nightshirt otherwise he would be perfectly content to remain in his drawers or even as naked as the day he was born—he has never been a modest man). He attempts to enjoy the warm milk that I have requested be brought each evening for him at approximately ten o’clock. Sometimes he will sit for a bit whilst I read to him. These are all tricks I have already learnt, and I am grateful that they do sometimes still work.
“Thank you.” He turned to leave, but was arrested in his motion by the pleasant voice.
“Apparently, working for Mrs. Bloom is not a pleasant experience. They are frequently lacking a maid-of-all-work or a cook or... well, anyone willing to work in the house for them.”
“It’s disgusting,” he sniffed, turning his back.
His brother tried again, but after his single word on the pavement—Mycroft’s name—he seemed unable to produce anything further.
I am taking the liberty of writing to you not just as a past client of Mr. Holmes, but also as an admirer of your stories regarding his investigations. I cannot fully express my excitement—and trepidation—upon receiving the latest issue of The Strand magazine and immediately realising that it contained your rendition of our adventure together. I have read it several times with great interest and not a little shame—not for myself, but about my stepfather and his wicked, wicked ways. I also found myself shedding tears anew for my dear sister, but am more than anything heartened and reassured by the fact that the mystery of her death was discovered whilst also keeping our family’s terrible secrets private.
“But some people have quite smooth skin—even on their hands.”
I had been away attending to a patient—a neighbour with a bad chest—and had left Sherlock to his own devices for several hours. He had been in an excellent mood, somehow enjoying an expansive breakfast whilst simultaneously rattling on about some test or other than he anticipated perfecting that very day.
I had not recorded but now recalled the stemware as well—a full row of crystal glasses of different shapes and sizes. Once again, I knew that each glass was intended for something different, but I had no idea why, for example, one could not drink water from the same type of glass as one drank wine, and most certainly could not recall which glass could receive a red wine and which a white. At one point in my past I did know a great deal more about these matters, but as one forgets a foreign language if one does not continually use it, I had forgotten a great deal of these finer points of etiquette.
In the earliest days, my writing was somewhat of a whim. I did not start out writing about any of his cases for publication. I was simply so intrigued by both the crimes and the detective that I wanted to capture my experiences for myself—but in doing so, I found that I could rather entertain myself by turning the interviews and investigations and deductions into stories. I admit to being influenced somewhat by the sensational yellow-backed novels in which I indulged (and Sherlock has never minded); sometimes when I was reading one I would think to myself that certainly I would not have had a character say something a certain way, or that I could have chosen five alternate words to the prosaic ones chosen by the author.
“Yes?” I did not understand his point.
She was fairly sure she had heard it correctly—mumbled, as it was, into his pillow—but she wanted to make sure.
He sighed. I patted his shoulder but did not interrupt. After a few deep breaths, he went on. “I laid my hand upon his knee.”
Of course, the very thought of presenting myself to you in your den of sin horrifies me; it would be positively indecent. Therefore, you will meet me at Langham’s Palm Court at teatime on Thursday and we will discuss the actions that my duty dictate.
“No…” I was laughing still, although quietly. I did not want him to think that I was teasing him. “How observant of you.”
“Yes, she does have several that are similar, but that’s sort of the point in
“Mm.” He pinched his lips together and nodded.
all cities had their own
Exaggerated, perhaps, and certainly biased, but true.
Mrs Parker, whose career prior to her employment as housekeeper in the stately mansion had been quite a bit more exciting, involving as it did what could be called a role as a “secret agent” back when the “enemies of the state” were Russian, had never seen such a damaged, broken human being—ever—who was still actually walking—and breathing.
“You do know better,” I pointed out.
missed something
Oh dear.
“Thank you.”
“These two first—” he indicated the two large men with a slight incline of his head—“and then you. I am not certain how he will react to seeing me. You must ascertain his state of mind before I reveal myself to him. I do not wish to distress him.”
“No reason precisely.”
Breakfast was a desultory affair. I had brought a few books along, and propped one in front of me as I gnawed on my toast. I did not care that it marked me as undoubtedly dining on my own. Staring at the empty chair on the opposite side of the table seemed a much worse pastime.
[The doctor seems to have been interrupted at this point and does not take up the thread of his narrative exactly where he left off.]
Little boys could get lost if they weren’t careful. It was a good thing that Big Brother was there with him.
“You know,” she mused, taking another sip, “I cannot recall such an oppressive heat as this for years. Not since… goodness. Mr. Hudson and my darling boy were still with me.”
I thought about what it must have been like—our respectable landlady hastily doffing shoes and stockings and, skirts gathered up just enough to bare her ankles, breathing a sigh of relief as she felt the cool foam of the surf wash over her bare feet—propriety be damned. I could picture her husband and son in their swimming costumes, running eagerly into the refreshing waves. I was fond of the idea that Mr. Hudson was an attentive and energetic father, perhaps splashing their son and later helping him build a sandcastle and hunt for shells.
Had I noticed the lady who was slipping silver teaspoons into her reticule? (I had not.)
,” the impatient man hissed. “All the houses that have had burglaries of small, expensive items like those—” he gestured at the bejewelled ring still clenched in the stiffening fingers of the corpse sprawled face-down in front of them— “with which estate agent are they listed?”
Friend.
“I see,” he nodded. “So, I’m in charge of illogical decisions?”
I was a bit puzzled, therefore, when I found the door to our sitting-room closed. There was a note affixed to it. I detached it and unfolded it. It was covered in Sherlock’s distinctive handwriting, and I have preserved it here.
He examined me carefully at this. “You said ‘we,’” he pointed out.
“And then I was born and ruined it all.”
“Oh, I am sorry, my darling!” I ejaculated as I realised what I had just said. “How idiotic of me. Why would you wish to share such disturbing information?”
“No,” Mycroft decided firmly but quietly. He sounded exhausted. “We can’t risk that—too difficult to maintain security. He’s safer here.” He and Anthea had already made it crystal-clear that every person in that room was to not just keep quiet about but if challenged to actively deny who they had been treating. “Besides,” he added even more quietly, “you’ve seen how he’s reacting now, in a familiar setting; what would it do to him to be in a hospital?”
John had gotten her lovely lambskin slippers with a textured sole that she could even wear to nip out to her bins. Sherlock had gotten her a book about growing herbs in pots  (and vegetables and fruit, but it was clear what he had intended). John gave him a smack on the back of his head, and then she and John laughed and Sherlock let his shy smile grace his face for a few seconds.
“I do know that,” he snapped. “But we simply cannot continue the way things have been going. My brother will continue to attempt escape until he succeeds—and simply letting him out there with no protection—no plan—would be beyond foolish. We must gain control of the situation.”
The basic neurological tests they could administer proved to be interesting. It was apparent from his reactions to the stimuli around him that his vision, at least in the eye that was not swollen shut, was fine, and his hearing seemed alarmingly keen—he had jumped when one of the nurses had clicked a pen open. His over-reaction to sensations was apparent and a cause for concern until Mycroft explained that, for Sherlock, that was normal. All of his senses—sensory input in general—had always been exemplary to the extreme, which made him an excellent detective but “a bit high strung” as well. Mycroft would have smiled at his own understatement if he had been in a different frame of mind.
I had purposely closed the door between my own room and Sherlock’s rather loudly to alert him of my movements. A moment later, Mrs. Hudson was knocking energetically on the door that separated Sherlock’s bedroom from our sitting room. “Mr. Holmes!” I heard her call out. “There’s a gentleman here who is quite insistent that he consult with you immediately.”
running in other cities
“Nothing? No…”
“What is that?”
Mycroft thought bitterly as he grasped one track-marked arm. “Calm down. These are doctors. They’re just trying to help,” he explained. “They need to examine you so they can make you feel better, all right?”
“Of course, sir.”
He shook his head and kept his mouth firmly shut.
“Sherlock,” I called—he was in the scullery by then— “will you come assist me?”
“Thank you, John.”
And so we did and rose and dressed and descended to the morning room and a full breakfast, and now I write these last few words as Sherlock packs up our things (he has insisted on taking care of my items as well as his own; as he put it, it is the least he can do after everything I have done for him).
He is an idiot—he is an idiot for going off on his own, and for frightening me. Yes, he is in glorious high spirits, but really, I did not appreciate the manner of his return to our rooms. I have put him to bed but am too distracted to join him just yet. I will have a bit more brandy and then see if the mood strikes me.
“I have been rolling around in warm manure,” he pointed out, impatiently snatching the flannel I offered from my hand. “I ruined my gloves.”
“How far could he get?” the driver commented, pulling into traffic. “He hasn’t got any money.”
“I said, it’s mine!”
“Yes.” He looked as if he was going to continue, but he abruptly dropped his eyes to his plate and we sat in silence and stillness for several moments. Finally, he pierced a bit of the fish that lay on his plate and swirled it around. “I only wish that I could have offered the same when our mother was so ill, but I was not yet in a position to do so.”
The daytime nurse, Solomon, nodded solemnly. “We can certainly try, sir,” he agreed.
I drew her into my examining room, gently excluding him. “I must examine her in private,” I said firmly. I already knew that it would not be a physical examination. That was not what she required.
“Oh, for heaven’s sake. What was it about this time?”
“Home—with me.”
“Will you leave?” he suddenly burst out, spinning on his cushions to look into my eyes. “Will you move away?”
“I presume that that means ‘yes’,” I commented. “Shall I give you something to ease it a bit?”
I also must admit that I, as I always do, felt nothing but tenderness and concern for him as I cleaned him up. Mrs. Hudson supplied some ice chips in a rag for his forehead. His hand is not so bad now that I have cleaned it—his fingers will be stiff for a day or two, of course, and I am sure that he will complain most bitterly about the inconvenience of it all.
“My poor sweetheart,” I remarked, finally offering him the sympathy he clearly desired. “You must be cold.”
“If you think that is best, Watson,” Sherlock murmured, “to be on your own.”
That was the only word he spoke for the remainder of the day. I attempted a few times to engage him in conversation and offered him endless cups of tea, but he took no notice of my pleas. He had curled up on the floor in front of the fire, in a nest of cushions and rugs, and his only movement was to light one cigarette after another.
After that, well…
Ah. At last. When I had been directed into his bedroom, only to find it empty, I knew where he was awaiting my arrival. I dropped his boots (where they would surely trip one of us—that seemed a sufficient reminder to have them tended to) and eagerly approached the door that joined our bedrooms.
your reaction.”
I was hopelessly in love with him and my heart ached to observe him so low.
“She did,” I affirmed, promptly and honestly. “She also participated in the distribution of cast-off clothing.” We both turned to our adversary.
“There is more. Apparently, not only do they not have children of their own, but both Mr. and Mrs. Bloom become extremely flustered when anyone inquires about this particular fact.”
“Victor,” he called out. The name caught in his throat and was obscured by a sudden burst of raucous laughter from the group. “Victor,” he tried again, a bit more loudly.
It took some time to get him to eat what they considered a reasonable amount. The nurse had politely accepted a bowl of the soup (it turned out to be delicious), so the housekeeper had filled one for her, one for herself, and then a smaller one—a saucer, really—for him. She presented him with a teaspoon. “Get your finger out of there,” she had instructed mildly. Guiltily he had withdrawn his finger from his bowl, putting it in his mouth and sucking off the thick, creamy soup.
“John, what would you think if upon the sight of a victim of strangulation, the constable at the scene suddenly fainted or began to weep?”
“I am relieved that she will be staying. She is nearly as good a cook as you are, Mrs Hudson,” I told her honestly.
“Oh, yes. Thank you, Doctor.” She realised instantly my point.
Our landlady came up with a tray holding a pot of fresh, hot coffee and clean cups and placed it on the table. She glanced over at the shut door, gave me a hesitant smile, and without a word exited.
“But then,” he continued, “if I look at it objectively—observe it, as I would in someone else—I would be forced to point out that my mother, who also suffered from these moods, did so for her entire life.”
“For the most part” does not mean always.
“Well, even presuming he’s gotten some money, he hasn’t got any ID,” she pointed out.
I finished my own sherry and reached for the glass that had been intended for my darling. He fidgeted with his cigarettes; with the assorted bric-a-brac that cluttered the mantlepiece.
“Hmm.”
I must have made some sort of noise as I observed this, for he suddenly glanced up and over towards the door and then, with a hiss and a scowl, he strode across the room, slammed the door shut, and locked it.
thought,” she responded sharply.
I did not like dosing him, particularly when he was in such a state, but after resisting that path for so many days, at that point I saw no other choice. He at least did not fight the laudanum, and soon enough we were able to carefully unwrap him. Someone brought me a bowl of water and a clean cloth; bandages. I cleaned the injuries as carefully as I would bathe an infant and wrapped them well.
“Perhaps,” the dark-haired man shrugged.
He shook his head rather ferociously.
I am most sorry that because of the wound, I could not kiss him on his lips when I tucked him into bed. He was being so very sweet by then, and turned up his lovely face to mine, and all I could do was to carefully press my own lips to his cheek.
He remembered all the times that he had been lulled to sleep by a gentle, sweet song played on the violin, the beautiful and calming notes drifting up the stairs to his bedroom.
He began it covertly; learning to tap into and manipulate the CC cameras that poked into virtually every space in London. That was actually required for his work. It was only after a particularly embarrassing incident requiring his involvement—he had long before gained the power to make criminal charges disappear—that it occurred to him that he might use the web of surveillance—quite literally “Big Brother”—to keep an eye on his errant sibling.
“I would think that he was clearly not suited to his line of work… oh,” I interrupted myself. I really can be quite dense sometimes. “I understand. That does make sense, but from now on, when you are disturbed by anything, once we are in private, will you please tell me what is distressing you and ask for some comfort?”
Sherlock grabbed at the flannel a few times, pulling it towards his face and inhaling deeply, a small smile gracing his cracked lips.
“Oh, yes, John. Do not think for even a moment that we are doing anything but going into battle.”
He watched as his brother’s chin fell to his chest. He seemed to be searching within himself; going deep down into his mind.
Sherlock, who had been out during our interviews, returned exactly in time for the very nice tea Belinda had prepared. She had not had time to make her own bread or cake, of course, but she had done some sort of cheese scones and a mustard spread for them that were just delightful. On her suggestion, we joined Mrs Hudson in her sitting room for our refreshment, and we agreed that she was a welcome addition to our household.
“Please, Sherlock, I need an answer. Do you wish for me to leave now?”
“That was a bit of luck, me running into Stamford that day,” I interjected. It certainly couldn’t hurt to remind them that there was someone who could verify the accuracy of my love’s statement.
“That’s wonderful, love.”
“Sir?”
where had he been
This time, once he was outside, instead of heading for a hidden bit of wall, he went directly for the gate. He had once again dressed himself, deliberately choosing the darkest shirt and suit of Mycroft’s that he could find. Now he stood very still, pressed up against and facing the wall just inside the gate, his head with its dark curls bowed down and his hands with their tell-tale pale skin in his pockets. The awkward bit would be manoeuvring around the open gate—it opened in the middle, and inwards, and of course there would be a car coming in, but after the humiliation of his first attempt, he had made a point of obediently eating as much of his dinner as he could manage. He wasn’t going to risk—well—he wasn’t going to let his transport get the better of him this time.
“My violin?” he sprang up as quickly as he had alighted. “Where is it?”
“We would pay their wages, of course,” I explained quickly. Sherlock nodded in mute agreement. “We shall place an advertisement in the newspapers this very afternoon.”
“I have observed these behaviours in men and women many times,” he explained. “I did not understand the significance at first, but after you and I... after you explained certain facts of life to me, I realised what those reactions in those settings actually signified. When I saw Mr. Bloom’s reaction to my touch and considered it along with the other factors I have already mentioned, I was certain.”
“What happened?” Solomon asked uneasily. Winifred had met him on the ground floor, where they went into the library together.
Pudding—a huge hit—was individual trifles. Sherlock had actually cracked another smile when presented with the small glass dish prettily layered with sherry-soaked sponge, raspberries, and custard. Sometimes Sherlock didn’t like whipped cream, so she had made some separately and dolloped it on her own and John’s, not fussing when Sherlock shook his head.
There had been a woman—dark hair and beautiful clothing and a wit as sharp as a tack. He had liked her, and she seemed to like him, but no—she didn’t seem the type to interfere with things like that.
He liked snakes. They could hide almost anywhere (well, the small ones could; the gigantic ones were rather more noticeable and the one in that book that Uncle Greg had read to him alarmed him a bit), which was brilliant, and the poisonous ones—well. He was particularly fascinated by the different venoms. There were ones that paralysed and ones that sort of made all your flesh a bit mushy (like peas but not green; he hated mushy peas but liked firm, round ones that popped when you bit into them).
[Sherlock has interjected a comment:
“What got him so upset?” she asked suspiciously.
[The following section is in pen.]
“No… it is time you knew. You have been so forthcoming in sharing with me your travails when you were away at war, and even of your experiences with your own father and brother.” He seemed to lose his initiative, his voice dropping back to nothing.
“My darling,” I murmured, kissing the back of his neck. “Why did you not? I longed to have a letter from you. You always write to me when we are apart—even when our separation is a painful one.”
“Mycroft was most affected by it,” he continued. “He was extremely ambitious—wanting to have a public life—and the stain of any impropriety was a deep one indeed. He began at quite a young age to counter all the… gossip, I suppose you would call it… with projecting an image of unimpeachable character. Was the new program at the musical hall a bit risqué? He would rather be caught dead than in attendance. Were some young men being characterised in the newspapers as being ‘ridiculous’ for wearing their trousers so full? His remained modest to the extreme. No bright colours; no fads. No new music or novels or
“Did they send the results yet?” the dark-skinned man asked his co-worker as they both watched him.
And now he was back in bed, his eyes shut. The man carefully covered him with a soft blanket.
“Yes.”
He handed him one of the penguin-wrapped packages. Unable to resist, Sherlock accepted it, giving it a sharp shake. “Puzzle,” he announced, looking bored.
Mrs. Bloom opened her mouth to speak, but Sherlock was too quick for her.
There were a few sheets with what seemed to be portions of chemical notations and equations. He was not nearly as well-versed as his brother in that area (he would never admit it aloud, but he had always been secretly proud of his brother’s excellence in the field), but he felt sure that the bits would make sense to a fellow chemist. Those were written in pencil. He glanced at Sherlock’s right hand and yes, it had a characteristic grey smudge on it.
“You perhaps were more vigorous in the application of avoidance of indecent behaviours than in performing pious ones.” My sweetheart’s voice was like warmed honey.
“It was not my fault.” He sounded like a small boy explaining away a broken vase.
I believe that I simply shrugged. I was taking my friend’s pulse and did not appreciate the interruption.
“Of course, sir. Should I get him some clothing?”
“Oh, the sitting room, please,” she begged as he gained the landing.
He looked—to be honest—dreadful. He was far, far too thin, and even with the coat over it (which was, compared to his lovely Belstaff, rather hideous) she could see that the suit he wore hung off him; the hat didn’t hide the fact that one eye was bruised and swollen; the white a vivid blood red. His beautiful lips were cracked and dry—and he was so very, very pale.
He was, without a doubt, adorable in a way that Mycroft had not been. He had the cherubic face. He had the curls. He had those eyes.
Sherlock Holmes to Dr. Watson:
I kissed his forehead before descending the stairs. “Cheeky boy,” I whispered.
She looked at him sharply, then tipped her head towards their patient, but her concern was unwarranted. Having finished his milk, he was now using the last bit of the chocolate mousse as ink and his finger as a pen, writing some sort of equation on the polished surface of the table and seemingly ignoring them entirely.
“Oh, one more thing.” He withdrew a wallet and placed a card on the table. “This is where you can reach me if you have a need.”
Cheery was one thing. Pathologically chipper—and an idiot—was another.
John switched the kettle off and poured the boiling water over the tea bag already in place. Not exactly a proper brew-up, he knew, but that was the way he did it.
For an answer, the thin man struggled to prop himself up on his elbows. He frowned and pulled his feet away from the gardener. Mycroft subconsciously noted that he had tied his shoes himself. “Where is the nurse?” he demanded.
“No wonder you were not eating. It always makes you lose what little appetite you have.” I was angry at him—partly because of his insidious habit and partly because he was being so evasive. I wanted him to admit it.
Mycroft nodded, his mouth a thin, tight line. “They aren’t going to hurt you, Sherlock,” he murmured, trying to grab one of the flailing arms. “You know I wouldn’t let that happen.”
off. He could feel himself tilting.
is his written commentary here.]
Yes, there he was. He turned away from her and moaned as he disturbed his thickly-bandaged wound.
And suddenly he was off—striding rapidly around the corner of the tidy little house.
wet cold dry baking
He had a large case open on his bed, and was rather haphazardly pulling articles of clothing out of his wardrobe and dresser and placing them in it.
He had been leery and protective of his little brother, of course—and perhaps the kidnapping was a bit over the top—but could anyone blame him? Or for the continued surveillance? He had certainly begun it only with the intention of keeping tabs on his brother.
“Scars can get very tight and dry.”
I rose and headed back to our rooms.
“Merry Christmas!” He walked over to him and accepted the bag so the silver-haired man could take off his coat.
“John, I…,” he reached out a hand and grasped my wrist, his grey eyes open now. “I can attend to the rest myself.”
“After Harrods.”
“I am afraid so. Mr. Harper and I went ‘round to his neighbours’ house. Unfortunately, the family was away from home at that time, but I did observe that their garden boasted several rose bushes.”
He frowned at me. “I always behave myself,” he declared, and if Mrs. Hudson had not been there I would have kissed the ridiculous pout.
What was true was that it was early April, and for some reason the drive in the trap from the station to the peculiar household we were to encounter seems especially vivid to me now.
A disconsolate whimper was the only reply. Conversation over.
“I used to—years ago. It was quite elegant. Antique, made probably 1895 or thereabouts. It was a Christmas gift from Mycroft just before my fifteenth birthday.”
The texts had been sent at three and four o’clock in the morning, respectively.
“Are you all right?” I had been growing more concerned about Sherlock by the day. He moved about in a dreamy, distant way, not answering questions. He would sit at the table at mealtimes, but more often than not after a bit he would rise again, leaving his food untouched, and stretch himself out on the sofa, his eyes shut and his fingers steepled and just resting on his lower lip.
Four days later, as I rounded the corner and approached our house, I was puzzled to observe the new maid-of-all-work making a hasty departure. As she was headed in my direction, I managed to impede her flight.
“You had to sedate him?” the other nurse asked, running her eyes down the extensive notes.
“Oh?” I moved toward her. Sherlock, still chewing, looked with interest to me and then to Mrs. Hudson.
“Never mind. It’s definitely time to take you home.”
“You...”
be hosting a party this year. The mad man with whom he shared his life had been so busy complaining about the mind-numbing music, garish store displays, and lack of well-planned, clever criminal activity he hadn’t dared to bring up anything about sending cards, decorating the flat, or planning a Christmas dinner earlier in the month.
No. He hadn’t.
He tried glaring at her, but his head was absolutely killing him, and scowling made it worse. He rubbed his forehead with the ball of one hand.
I snorted. Meretricious—there was no indication of the sender on the envelope in which the bill for my boots was contained. No indications that I could detect, at least. I examined it more closely. Other than the postmark showing from where and when it had been posted, I had no idea. I would allow him to tell me later and praise him for his genius, of course.
“I did, of course, manage to get myself decently attired and come to the crime scene with you.”
“Highly public difficulties, apparently,” I said, my voice low. “I am ashamed. I had no idea that my indiscretions were so widely known.”
“You have a real problem with sexuality, don’t you?” John pondered calmly. “It’s interesting. You know, homophobia often covers up latent homosexuality.” He glanced over his shoulder. Jeremy and Tony were long gone; safely escaped. Good. He was beginning to enjoy himself. If things went in the direction he hoped, he didn’t want them involved, even as witnesses. They had enough problems.
“I’ll do it,” Etta offered. “You should be off the clock.”
It was, of course, entirely ridiculous to expect him to then simply pursue a career in a research lab or some related area. No—he had returned to his wayward lifestyle, often sleeping rough and supplementing the money he and their parents gave him (it’s a loan, their parents would insist—he’ll pay us back when he settles down) in ways that still made Mycroft shudder.
a single thing.
He discovered them in the library. That was no great surprise. After the kitchen, that was Sherlock’s favourite room in the house. He paused in the hallway outside.
They were concerned when, instead of continuing the “conversation,” their patient dropped his head to the table, hitting his forehead on the smooth surface.
He called up a name from his tidy list of contacts and hit the icon that would bring him in touch with
When he was done he folded the paper it into sloppy quarters and shoved it into his pocket.
Well. That
“Scotch?” John asked, motioning the DI to join him in the kitchen.
“Yes, I am Doctor Watson,” I responded, making it clear from the tone of my voice that I was rather more than a bit taken aback by his forwardness. “May I ask who you are?”
“We started playing because you get so wound up you make yourself ill. You don’t take care of yourself and don’t let me or Greg take care of you.”
“John,” he responded, looking into my eyes, “you wouldn’t let him do that, would you? Mycroft, John would not allow you to do so.” He sounded haughty and self-assured, but his expression was stricken.
“I shall strike out for Baker Street tomorrow,” I stated. “But for now I do not like to leave him alone for long.”
“John,” he reproached, “you were a solider in Afghanistan, which has a much more inhospitable climate than England. You have shared with me the horrors of the conditions of your service and of the misery of your illness, and even in the throes of the worst of your fevers, you have never actually remarked that it was too hot for you.
At first meant just that—the first time.
“Sherlock? Time to wake up.”
He was dismayed to discover that for some reason his balance was off, his running hampered, and the nurse accompanying him was not just strong but fast.
I strongly suspect that Sherlock was never indulged in that manner by anyone—ever.
“Most certainly, that is,
He seemed content during the performance; he was not perhaps quite as entranced as he sometimes became, but he was still and attentive. There was an interval, during which I sought out the gents, but he remained in his seat, motionless and silent.
I do love you, so very, very much.
He was already on his knees in front of the toilet. The retching was violent. Dave edged past him, retrieved a glass, and filled it with water. When there seemed to be a stop to it, the nurse reached over his patient’s head and flushed. “Here. Rinse.” He tipped the glass up to the chapped lips.
The man wanted to kiss other men. That was fine. He knew it was fine because Big Brother had told him that, and his brother was always right.
“You…” and my breath shuddered. “You knelt to examine the seat of the chair next to me.”
“I do hope so. The Holmes brothers are without a doubt two of the most difficult men in England to deal with, but they’re both brilliant in ways that you and I cannot even begin to fathom.”
“More? You do not need to share any more if it distresses you so.” I felt a bit ill at having led the conversation down this path.
“What the hell are you talking about?!” The man bellowed, his face flushed a deep red.
Domesticity—yes. That was the thread running through my thoughts. Here was a bachelor suddenly endowed with what were without a doubt the trappings of the domestic situation of a married man. The china, the silver, the crystal—two place settings. It was meant as a message. But to what end? And from whom?
“Hey, thanks for the gift.”
“Now that Mrs Hudson is back on her feet, there is no need for her services, or at least… I believe… John, that is quite distracting.” He smiled indolently at me.
I prodded my darling awake as she left us. He grumbled and fussed, but I bestowed several kisses on his beautiful face before sliding out from under the bedclothes and slipping through the connecting door to my own room to dress—and thank heavens for that door, for it would hardly have been seemly for us to emerge from the same bedroom, and in our nightclothes.
“You wouldn’t. You would not. You would not send me… there. Please, Mycroft. No. Please don’t send me there. Please don’t send me away. I’ll behave. I promise.” His anguish and terror were horrible to witness.
“You are quite the expert at that,” I commented, and she frowned at me without malice.
As I examine this letter from the real “Miss Helen Stoner” I find myself reflecting on various issues. Yes, I do change names, and dates, and locations, and sometimes other details, all with the intention of disguising the true identities of the unfortunates involved in the sometimes loathsome crimes investigated by my friend. In this case, I invented all the names, changed the location and the name of the manor-house and the inn, and set the entire story eight years back, when in truth it happened barely a year ago.
“Are you two smoking?” Winifred demanded angrily.
Mycroft was a man divorced from sentiment and detached from his own emotions—but sometimes he nearly wept as he observed the assured path to self-destruction that was his brother’s life.
My stomach turned. We were doomed. Or at least so I thought at that moment. I should have had the sense to realise that my dear friend would not—could not—endanger himself or me, and that he had the entire situation well in hand. Fortunately, it was a mere moment before my fears were relieved.
Mycroft rose. “I cannot remain any longer,” he explained. “Urgent business requires my attention.”
Blushing furiously, he addressed me directly. “Your war wounds... surely impede you still.”
And then something occurred to me that had me sitting bolt upright.
“Then what…?”
If all the homes that had been burgled had already been listed for sale, it would probably have been far too obvious. But a valuation? Some of the homeowners, flustered and distraught by the break-ins, probably had not even thought to mention that they had recently had one done when asked about any strangers in their homes.
Sherlock glanced up at him and smiled a bit shyly before bending his head to the colourful pages again.
Two shepherd’s pies in individual ramekins, popped into the microwave in the surgery’s staff room, would have been perfect, but the ramekins had remained in the kitchen at Baker Street when he had moved.
Sherlock had been holed up in the bedroom since the mobile toss, so hadn’t observed John’s activities. The doctor was fine with that, truth be told; sulky, stroppy Sherlock was getting on his nerves. He knew that all the attention Sherlock was receiving was precisely the sort of attention he abhorred. It had nothing to do with his brilliance, so he saw no purpose in it.
When we had finished, I suggested a bath and fresh clothing, and he had nodded in wordless agreement. I knocked on the door to the corridor to have the tray taken away and to see who was in the corridor. I had hoped to see Henry, but after his overnight vigil with us, I knew that he was in need of respite. The attendant there—Patrick—took the tray and nodded as I explained my intent. I made it clear that I would oversee this activity myself.
“Perhaps someone else should administer that?” he said sharply, snatching it from her.
I did as I had said, seating myself on a decorative little bench that was tucked under a lattice covered all over in ivy. The greenery threw a pleasant, cool shade onto the seat and I shut my eyes.
What had he done?
So, although these facts (for the most part) were absolutely cause for me to feel embarrassment and shame, they did not reveal anything
He turned his gaze to me, and he took a deep, shuddering breath, and he replied.
“Pain?” Mycroft echoed uneasily.
“Please, call me Etta,” she insisted. “Henrietta is so old-fashioned.”
“You have been stiff at an investigation prior to this morning?” His astonishment and outrage were a bit worrying.
explanations, you not only made it clear that I must accompany my friend today, but you gave me quite a treasure-trove of information about yourself.
forever
His voice now became a bit wistful. “I am also not in a traditional relationship. I am not a husband and father, hurrying home to quiet evenings by the hearth, listening to my children recite their lessons whilst my wife mends my socks.”
“True,” the government man nodded. When he had turned up, his brother hadn’t had anything—not a pound; not a wallet even. No mobile. Certainly no passport(s).
Thus fortified, they struck out again.
“What do you mean, my darling?” I asked, kissing his temple. I was proud of him to have remembered her name and resumed my ministrations.
I must explain that by gradually I mean over a period of days. I also do realise that he might, over that same number of days, begin to calm and still simply because of the cycle of such moods, but I also feel that by treating him thusly I am letting him know that I accept that he has no control over these fits, and that I want nothing more than to guide him to calmer waters.
“Well, there is no reason to say good-bye to Belinda,” Mrs Hudson smiled mysteriously.
He recovered himself swiftly, however, and first helped me back into my coat and then, drawing my hand through his arm, he supported me as we made our way out towards the street. I wanted to protest his action, but found myself at a loss for words. He was only demonstrating a kindness—why should I have an objection? How was he to know how much this brought to my mind the countless times Sherlock has linked his arm in mine so that we might stroll down the pavement pressed against one another in an acceptable manner?
It won’t be difficult. His words of admiration have struck me in an odd way and I am a bit unsure of my voice.
“Poor man.” He looked down at the chart again.
“The new ones?” No wonder he was in a mood. They had been very nice gloves, of dove grey. He was so fussy about his costume and had been particularly pleased with them. “I am sorry to hear that.”
He now looked up at the nurse sharply. “Yes. I’m perfectly fine. Take him and get him cleaned up.”
What he revealed horrified me so much that I—I admit this in retrospect and I am truly disgusted at my own behaviour—I walked out on him. I simply put on my coat and hat and walked down the stairs and out the street door and I did not return for hours. What I did—how I responded—I am ashamed.
I am not certain who looked more shocked—Mrs. Bloom, Mr. Bloom, or myself. I had sensed the direction in which he was headed, based upon his line of questioning, but I had not anticipated such a blunt observation.
“Nonsense. It will make you feel so much better, and I am quite serious—as your doctor there is nothing more I can do for you at present but to clean you up and cool you off.”
“All right,” I agreed. “But I would like to learn more about him, if that is permissible.”
“I think that even Anderson could deduce that one,” Greg chuckled.
Sherlock frowned in apparent confusion. Mycroft took one thin, trembling hand and pulled him gently in the correct direction. He took a few stumbling steps, then stopped dead. The trembling increased as he shook his head furiously.
“Put poisons buh… tween those…” he muttered. Both nurses looked at each other and then at him.
“It was rather close in our rooms earlier, so I opened the windows. I moved your chair a bit so it isn’t in a draught. –Sherlock.”
He had his mug.
He looked at me thoughtfully. “You could not bear…?” he murmured, considering the idea.
“I am not asking you to wear them,” I pointed out.
There was a time in his life when he got texts on a far-too-frequent basis—all ludicrously wordy, frequently demanding that he do something dangerous, and nearly always ridiculous.
“What’s going on?” she asked, keeping her voice low.
He smiled and patted my knee. “There. There’s my army captain.”
“A paramour, yes, but not a lady,” he explained quietly.
“Ima pie-rut.
“So how did you make the leap to presume that Mr. Bloom is an invert?”
“I also believe that you will be perfectly capable of bringing up the coal and laying the fires—for us
“See? No prob—”
He winced. His lips hurt—he could taste blood on them—but the water felt good going down his parched throat and he drank about half of the glass before he suddenly felt overly full and pulled his head back. The nurse—had she been there the night before? —gently lowered it. “Good job,” she murmured.
“It’s very easy to say the right things,” he sighed. He shifted slightly, hunching over a bit, and his expression changed to pensive and vulnerable and contrite in an alarmingly convincing way. “I feel so bad; what I’ve put my parents through. I really couldn’t see it—it was all about the next hit; the next high. Now the thought of doing anything like that…” he let his voice drop down as he shuddered in mock horror and revulsion.
Mary Morstan.
John sighed heavily. Yes, he knew all about good stories. He knew all about pirates. He knew all about stitches. He knew all about falling.
This really was a dull case—at least the solution was. The execution was, I admit, intriguing. But did that young woman truly believe that committing a burglary—of sorts—and trespassing would make her more attractive as a wife?
“That’s what I’m supposed to do,” she argued. She was getting fed up now—pompous bastard.
“I’ll do it, sir,” Ian offered. “Could you two please hold him steady?” he asked, indicating the two other assistants with a tip of his chin.
“What in heaven’s name are those?” Sherlock exclaimed, amusement and distain being presented in equal terms by the cadence of his voice.
arousal
“How about an orange?” the older brother suggested. He considered him curiously, then looked to the nurse for approval before nodding slowly.
“Calm yourself, John,” my dear friend suggested, laying a hand on my arm. “What I learned was this: although several shopkeepers verify that there must be a second person in the house when Mr. Bloom is supposed to be on his own, no one has ever seen who it is. He keeps to himself at those times—indeed, he even declines invitations, preferring to remain at home and rarely opening his door to visitors.”
“You do recall the foods that my brother finds acceptable,” he stated, seating himself at the large round table and indicating with a nod that she should sit across from him.
John’s sister launched into an overly detailed, overly enthusiastic description of her latest girlfriend and her family, commenting several times on how welcoming they were. When he was finally able to end the call, he rolled his eyes. Sherlock, who had been buried in a new book, glanced up and frowned.

“You don’t mean—”
signs—of trauma.”
“You can do this, Sherlock,” he encouraged. “Do you want something? What do you want? Tell me.”
“Yeah… he’s not really good about using the loo sometimes. But he likes baths.”
“Mmm… don’t think it’s a client. She’s local—oh, yes! Now I recall. She works in her father’s shop around the corner. Perhaps she is here to visit Mrs. Hudson,” I suggested.
“Well, you are to come with him, of course.”
I held him more closely. He was trembling. “Yes, of course I am certain. How could you possibly think that?”
And upon reflection, I also must admit that his story was quite exciting, and his description of the strong language of the man as “vigorous adjectives”—he just made me laugh at that, he is so very prim at times—and I am rather proud of him for sending the ruffian home in a cart.
How could he have forgotten?
Fussy and floral and feminine. Yes, there was no doubt in my mind—the perpetrator had been a woman, and one with matrimony on her mind.
Upon discovering him, Sean—the assistant in the car with him—and his driver had quite literally tackled him, and while Mycroft summoned the two assistants who had remained behind in his office to come out and help, Benjamin sat on his legs and Sean held his arms. The four of them had to man-handle him into the house and up the stairs.
Never. He had never, ever been able to turn it off, nor to ignore it. Not since infancy. His loving parents (he admitted that that was what they were; even if Dad was the sane one, Mummy did an admirable job of faking it) had been baffled. They loved—adored—doted on—their sons. Mycroft, while not terribly affectionate, had been at least somewhat responsive to their affections (he had corrected that later in life, but he did not claim responsibility for anything he had done under the age of fourteen).
They both watched as the silent man filled a bowl with water and placed it carefully on the table. He had already gathered and deposited there a sewing needle and a magnet from the refrigerator. Now he looked around the room and lunged towards a drawer, withdrawing a box of greaseproof paper.
“And yet you are perfectly willing to move half a world away from me?”
“Yes.”
“I said
He ended up sitting on the floor on a few cushions, facing the fireplace, as was his wont, and I sat back in my chair. He fidgeted with his pipe. “What do you wish to know?” he finally asked, getting his pipe drawing properly.
The latest nurse was Dave. He was of medium height and build. His hair was a nondescript brown and prematurely thinning. He wore glasses. His accent was Received English; his voice a bit high-pitched. Other than a few acne scars on his cheeks, he was so unremarkable as to be almost a caricature.
And then his patient was lunging across the room again, but this time it was into the attached bathroom. Dave dropped his rucksack and sprinted after him.
“Teatime. At Langham Hotel.”
An hour later, Mycroft shook his head. “I cannot allow that, and you know it, Sherlock. I cannot allow you to return to your home while you’re still so… confused.”
distress,” I surprised myself by admitting. “I have never seen him so completely baffled. He tries very hard, but no matter the effort, he cannot calm himself. It is so rare that Sherlock Holmes does not accomplish what he sets out to do that I believe he is utterly confounded. This adds to his anguish tenfold—his
“So, what have you discovered?”
“And now, my love,” I whispered with the lightest application of my teeth to his white skin, “I have thought of a rather novel way of driving my point home.”
John and Greg exchanged significant looks over the dark curls and nodded in affirmation of each other’s silent observation. Finally, John picked up another of the gifts. “Hey, ‘Lock, this one’s from Uncle Greg.” Sherlock spun around to face him, and he handed him the gift bag. Long fingers swiftly extracted a blue plastic case with a clear plastic front.
“Was there any shouting? Insults? Did you get chucked out?”
man sent her heart into her throat.
He handed him one of the books he had found; he and the nurse on a previous shift had gone in search of the library and the nurse had helped him bring several books upstairs. The fastidious man sighed as he saw them stacked on the floor next to the sofa.
“Is that the letter you did not post?” He nodded. I was alarmed. What had him so upset? “What was in it that was so difficult for you to write?” I inquired, rising from my desk and approaching him. He shook his head, unable to respond. “What happened to it? Do you still have it?”
“He doesn’t speak much.”
His brother got to his feet, swaying slightly. Everyone in the room paused in their activities, and then they were astounded by the broken, battered, terrified man suddenly grabbing the nurse’s hand and tugging her along as he lurched out into the hallway.
“Well, yes, of course. That is why sometimes simply holding a crying baby close—against your chest—comforts and quiets them.”
“She was so grateful, and promised that she would return, but the walk will do her some good, and it has given me some time to consider all that has transpired.”
John would be livid.
“We can’t give him anything stronger for the pain, sir,” Christopher, back for the evening shift, insisted. “He’s not strong enough.”
“Will the comfort always be like this?” he sighed in my ear.
, you idiot,” he hissed.
“Did anyone offer any restoratives?” I asked, my professional concern taking hold of me. That sort of thing must be happening all over the city, I reflected.
“No.”
He rolled onto his back and blearily opened his eyes. She could see them glisten in the dim light of the single lamp she had turned on (other than her booklight, of course—she could not have survived the years of night shifts without it).
I laughed, and he joined me. And then I calmed myself. “Now, while that certainly creates an amusing picture, I am afraid I have diverted you from my original question—what did you learn that made you so certain that the Blooms will not make good on their threats?”
She also admitted to playing Words with Friends online on occasion.
“I am just a bit taken aback,” I admitted. “I will be honest—and a bit churlish. I believed that it had happened much longer ago.”
“Puh…pie-rut, My.”
He did not reply. Instead, he dropped his newspaper and bowed his head down until his chin met his chest. “I was trying to write you a letter.”
“Do you think…” He paused, uncharacteristically unsure. An idea had come to him, but, for once, he was out of his depth. “Do you think my brother would react well to me joining him for dinner?”
God, am I such a deviant that I cannot control my lewd thoughts even in public?
“I see.” Mycroft glanced towards the house, his expression dark. “Can you get him inside?”
“I am sorry, Doctor. I have strict instructions not to mention Mr Holmes.”
It was now dawn and Mycroft stood and stretched. He had been working with his laptop at the small desk—it really was an enormous room, Winifred had noted in admiration, and the rest of the house was equally impressive—while she read a book; she was seated on the straight-backed chair that he generally used when putting on his shoes.
“I suppose his nibs took no notice of the temperature,” she snorted, changing the subject.
I always forget how heavenly it is to be thus—in bed with my darling. I had stripped us both of any extraneous garments, so now I felt his cool skin against mine. I kissed his beautiful face and neck and shoulders, then settled down with his frail frame in my arms.
“Good Lord, Sherlock. You smell like you’ve been rolling around in manure. What have you been doing?”
She winced as Mycroft abruptly rose. She could have phrased that more delicately, she realised—or not asked at all.
I felt deeply ashamed. I knew that my darling and I caused her quite a bit of work, but I had never heard her put it in such plain terms. “I am so very sorry,” I immediately apologised. “I know that we create nothing but chaos and disorder.”
“He did not want me to grow bored,” she explained in some amusement.
I do remember that very first meeting—really, how did he, seeing that I was a stranger, know that announcing the results of his experiments with haemoglobin would not shock and horrify me? He is the most observant man in England (except for his brother, of course). If he, at that first glance, thought it acceptable to rush over and announce his findings—what did he see in me that I was not aware of?
Mycroft felt a bit guilty, so he switched off his feed from the camera in the kitchen. Not that there was much to watch. He admitted to the slightest twinge of jealousy as he watched his brother devour the bacon butty. White bread, brown sauce, and streaky bacon were most definitely not on his list—but most assuredly were on Sherlock’s.
“What?” I was genuinely shocked. “No, of course not. Whatever makes you think that?”
“I have no idea. I think he was just disoriented—I mean, more than usual. You know how it is sometimes when you wake up suddenly. He was trying so hard to tell me. He got himself so frustrated, and he started slamming his hands on the floor.” She demonstrated the angry motions.
I am not entirely sure how he was breathing.
But it was equally clear that if he did not return him to Baker Street, his little brother would most assuredly self-destruct in his desperation to see Dr John Watson.
“Did he break the skin?” another nurse asked solicitously. No, he hadn’t.
Mycroft sighed heavily as he entered the code that would open the electronic lock on the entrance to his office. Those dark curls, while endearing to older women and apparently “sexy” to others, drove him mad with their untidiness—
I took a deep breath. He was forcing me—quite deliberately—to state what I did not want to face. But I was an ex-army captain and I could do this. “I would put you in an asylum and I would encourage them to use restraints, and locked doors, and not to be tricked by your talented tongue—and it would all be for you, my friend. It would all be to keep you safe. That is all I desire, Sherlock. I wish for you to be safe, and if I must be cruel to be kind, so be it.”
He made his way back to the sofa, lurching from the support of the wall and stumbling until he was able to drop down onto it. The woman—a nurse—sat beside him and handed him the glass. He frowned as he attempted to control his hand—it was shaking so badly that he nearly spilled the water—and she matter-of-factly reached over and, with wonderfully cool fingers, supported and guided it until he could sip a bit.
“Yes.
Then I obediently took myself into his bedroom. I rummaged around among the various shoes and boots in his wardrobe before retrieving the damaged pair. I was a bit puzzled—I had assumed that I would discover another note in one of them. I rose—and there it was, pinned to the inside of the wardrobe door, at my eye level.
Anthea had the presence of mind not to reply, bending instead to her ever-present mobile. “We’ve had a sighting,” she reported calmly.
“Ordinarily, yes,” I intervened, “but the entire reason that we are having this conversation now is because you are not making good decisions.”
Solomon was delighted. His patient had, after being dried off and redressed, allowed himself to be manoeuvred down into the kitchen (he seemed more relaxed when in that room than anywhere else in the house) and he had eaten several slices of apple (peeled and doused with lemon and cinnamon sugar, as Mr Holmes had instructed) and two chocolate biscuits.
“I realise that until this morning you had no idea that I existed, but please do not blame my brother for that. It was not an oversight but a purposeful omission. He and your landlady have been given explicit instructions not to mention me unless it becomes an absolute necessity.”
“Certainly, sir.”
for Mrs Hudson.”
of his affliction. When he has those moments when he is apparently unaware that there is something wrong, he is actually quite jovial and companionable.”
“But I still succumb to hunger and fatigue, do I not?”
“We’ll take them.”
“Yes, John. Her given name is ‘Rose’.”
“How am I supposed to pay for that?” Mrs Hudson replied a bit testily. Obviously, the severity of her predicament was sinking in.
I truly cannot bring myself, even now, to describe all of what we experienced as Sherlock became aware that we most certainly were not headed for the train station.
“So,” he continued, “I find that keeping the ‘Ten Commandments’ as laid out in the Christian Bible... and Torah... at the foremost of my thoughts a helpful tool during investigations. I believe the particular statement most relevant to the situation in front of us is from Exodus, Chapter 20, verse... sixteen. ‘Thou shalt not bear false witness against thy neighbour.’” I admit, simultaneously with being impressed with his facility with the text—and its relevance to the situation—I was somewhat annoyed at how smug he sounded. I almost immediately discovered, however, that his attitude was both appropriate and well-earned.
For Sherlock, after enjoying his cigar and a small glass of sherry, played his violin.
“And it is now necessary,” I realised, “because of Holmes’ illness.”
By the end of the second sentence, I knew that there was nothing at all usual about it.
They got home shortly before midnight on Christmas Eve. They had finally departed NSY around ten o’clock, but John had not begrudged Sherlock’s detour into a few of the darker corners of the city before they headed for Baker Street. He watched with a small smile as the thin man quietly and unobtrusively distributed bank notes to the homeless, surreptitiously slipping something into the pockets of those who were sleeping.
She couldn’t figure out what he wanted, and he began to get frustrated. “B…” was all he could manage.
Never mind.
The medical team members glanced at one another and agreed—yes, it was enough. They had done as thorough a job as they could under the circumstances.
“It’s not guilt!” He grimaced and slammed his mouth shut at the self-revelation.
“Precisely. So, when Mrs. Bloom is away... John, what do
“My poor sweetheart,” I murmured, cradling him in my arms. “I am here, and we shall be quite cosy in our bed.”
“So, you admit that sometimes you cannot push away those feelings of desire?”
As he so often did, Sherlock either did not discern or ignored my levity. “Oh, yes, John,” he reported solemnly. “I have had many quite pleasant conversations with her, and she read to me, and I to her, and I played for her several times, and she was not even cross about the smoke that evening.”
Our adversary was struck dumb, as was her husband and, I admit, I, so he continued unimpeded.
Whatever Victor had given him had worn off. His arms and legs ached. His neck and chest were cold. The sound of the flipping cards was beginning to drive him mad, and he wanted a cigarette. And he was now aware of a
“That’s a good sign, isn’t it?” the housekeeper had asked, pausing in her preparations to look over their shoulders.
“Because I am awful and difficult and distress people and have no control over these fits…” He collapsed down onto himself again, hiding his beautiful features from my eyes.
It was cream of tomato and he usually liked that. Someone used to make it for him. Who was that? It was on the tip of his tongue—the name was. The soup wasn’t. He did usually like it, but at that moment the thought of eating anything was making him feel horrid.
“Sentiment, John? No. Clearly.”
He stopped himself from thinking about the food. Annoying was one thing. Distressing was another.
He nodded emphatically, looking lost and confused.
“No! I have a plan to help him relax, and I’d like you here.”
“But there is no reason to when the old things are perfectly fine.”
well enough…. Sherlock,” I admonished, “we know that it is not your fault that you are stricken. Your brother has told me that your mother was similarly afflicted and we do know that even this most terrible form of your affliction will eventually pass. We all must be patient.”
John sighed. He should have seen
“Ge-Ni-U-S,” Mycroft translated. “So apparently his massive ego is still intact.” He would have denied it if challenged, but there was no doubt as to the pride in his voice.
“We need to find out who they are, but I don’t wish to draw attention to the incident by asking them too many questions,” Mycroft admitted. “The same with the police sergeant who was on duty that night.”
It was, in fact, that very duty which led me to my realisation. I had reached out to the director of the London Zoo for advice and to possibly arrange for the transportation of the animals to that establishment, and in doing so, I had to, of course, make a list of the wildlife.
“Aren’t you handsome?” Solomon commented. The man in front of him looked at him, and then his clothing, dazedly, as the strong, dark hands smoothed his lapels.
All right. He had had enough of this lunatic’s crap. The DI was expecting him back at the Yard as soon as they bagged up the body. “Oi!” he shouted. “That’s enough.”
“No, it would not have been noticeable by anyone else, but to my eyes it was quite plain.”
“We most certainly did,” she retorted, smiling at her success in surprising me with this frivolity. “Along with half of London. The train was quite full—I got a seat, but Mr. Hudson took our boy onto his lap—he was grown enough that it could not have been comfortable, but there was not another seat in the carriage.”
She shook her head. “Clearly not. I admit that I was confounded. I decided to be direct.”
We both had a good appetite, as it turned out, and finished our cold supper with alacrity. As we ate, we reflected on our outing.
“Nothing. He had a rotten day. Escape attempt number three while they were trying for a scan again this morning, and he succeeded for long enough to get his hands on some money and go straight to a dealer.”
“B… buh…,” he explained.
I finished the fingernails on his right hand and carefully wiped both arms with the sponge. “Oh, dear. That is a shame. How did he come to lose it?” I commented.
“Sweep it?” Anthea asked.
would do—because in his musings it had occurred to him that if his “situation” was revealed, what would Victor be able to say? He clearly couldn’t have tied both of his hands by himself. Once tied, he couldn’t have arranged the duvet. It would be instantly apparent that Victor himself had done it—and what would that say about
As I continued to bathe him, he began to relate his eventful day.
“Sherlock, stop that.” He looked down at his brother, who was standing up against him with his face hidden on his shoulder, whimpering softly. “You don’t have to sleep in the bed if it frightens you.” He considered what to do. “How about this? Would you like to sleep on the sofa in my bedroom instead?”
He was so engrossed in his own thoughts that I had to give him a hand up into the trap. This startled him, and he gave me a piercing if fleet glare. I felt my face fall; he really did seem to be headed down one of those dark paths upon which he sometimes lost himself. But then it was my turn to be startled when he suddenly gave me the most affectionate, sweet,
He sulked for a second or two more before continuing. “Mrs. Bloom is in the habit of going to the countryside to visit a relative fairly regularly. Her visits generally last a week, and sometimes she is away a fortnight, leaving Mr. Bloom to a bachelor existence and entirely alone for the duration.”
“Oh, I don’t know,” Mrs Parker opined.
It took a few seconds, but then there was a slight fluttering of eyelids and a grunt; the unnerving eyes opened a bit. He licked his dry lips. “Just need some air,” he mumbled.
“How did you find me here?” he demanded, glaring up from his position on the floor, lying on some filthy sofa cushions.
“Well, yes, of course. Walking is not only going to be painful but will likely increase the swelling—and the last thing your burned skin needs is to be stretched further. You must not just avoid walking on it, but keep it raised.”
“More than the shirts and books you requested,” I added.
Your wife is not dead. She is living in New York under an assumed name. She is passing herself off as Mrs. Daniel Ryder. I do not know the man she claims to be her husband, and I do not believe that they are truly married.
We had been roused from our bed that morning (it had been just past nine o’clock but I hadn’t gotten to bed before one o’clock and Sherlock had tumbled in to join me sometime after four) by the energetic ringing of the bell. I rolled over, unwinding Sherlock’s long arms from around my chest and shoulders, and slid out from under the blankets. I immediately hurried to my own bedroom before the familiar steps of our landlady began to ascend the steps that led to our rooms.
“Lie back,” someone was telling him. Yes, his eyes were heavy and his head hurt and he was very tired, but he needed to find John. He shook his head.
Not raising his head, he pointed at his own desk. I stepped over to it and searched first its cluttered top, and then opened the top drawer. There it was. He had gotten it as far as being in an envelope and addressing it to me at my hotel before apparently changing his mind about sending it along. “May I?” I asked formally.
“That is preposterous. I’ve never felt better.”
Anyway, I was doing well at first. The task of inventorying the two full place settings of silver, crystal, and china that had appeared on our client’s dining room table overnight—including writing down those mysterious markings on the bottom of everything—distracted me exactly the way I required. That the room was almost uncomfortably warm already, and it was not yet noon, worked on my behalf as well. Truthfully, I was feeling rather wilted. But then I allowed my attention to wander, and that led to a grievous situation on my part.
“Do you need a phone?”
“How do you know that if you haven’t even come within three feet of the table?” I challenged.
“Whatever is the matter?” I demanded, tossing my hat towards the rack and dashing down the narrow hallway.
“You’re not concerned they’ll just use the cash for drugs?” he inquired as they made their way through the quiet streets.
“What do you mean?”
Better, he thought to himself. The hat (not The Hat—that ridiculous death frisbee) covered the gash on his head and he tugged it down over the swollen eye so it was in shadow and (hopefully) hardly noticeable. The coat (not The Coat, which he missed terribly) disguised the slightly (all right, more than slightly) loose shirt and suit. The gloves covered the bruises—
It was also pleasant to recognise that that smile had been a silent request for strength and a silent offering of his love for me, and I had pressed my hand where it lay upon his arm in assurance.
a behaviour that is considered to be immoral is easier than setting oneself into motion to perform acts of morality, is it not? If I simply avoid eating meat, I am a vegetarian, whereas if I wish to be a carnivore, I must intentionally seek out and devour animal flesh.
“Eventually someone gathered me up in their arms and brought me back up to bed. I do not remember anything after that, except that sometimes when I awoke from those horrible fever-dreams, the housekeeper was there by my bedside, and her face was… I did not quite understand it then, but now I realise that she had been weeping.”
The intensity and swiftness of his attack on what we thought was a serpent reminded me, for the second time in less than 24 hours, of how his slender frame belies his strength. He is breath-taking to watch when he is so energetic. I, of course, had not been merely sitting there gaping at him all that time, but the image of him striking the false bell-rope so furiously with his cane returned to me again and again in the weeks which followed.
The pale, dark-haired man on the bed was slowly bringing himself into an upright position. He clutched the blanket spread over him, looking at it rather dazedly. He redirected his gaze—looking first at Christopher and then at Matilda.
She said it was quite queer to read about her own “death” in one of your bizarre stories, but she knew it was necessary to allow her to shed her prior identity. And I am certain that, although she did not allude to it, she will certainly never recover fully from her abrupt relocation to America, so far away from truly civilized society.
“My love!” I exclaimed. “That was quite foolhardy of you. What if he turned out to be a maniac? You could have been attacked and I would not have had the slightest idea where you were.” I stopped my ablutions and looked at him quite sternly.
“He shifted in his chair—just the slightest bit—and tilted his head towards him.” He nodded, as if this statement proved all.
Both operatives pretended not to notice when the man who usually personified a stiff upper lip hesitated the slightest bit at the mention of his brother. They had been brought up to date by Anthea before she had gratefully gone home sometime after midnight, of course, but neither of them felt it was their place to bring it up.
“Got him!” Anthea cried in triumph. She rattled off an address to the driver and they took off, Mycroft leaning forward eagerly. Finally, a security camera had picked him up. There had been earlier sightings, of course—and how clever of his little brother to have made the clothing purchases he had—but this time they were close enough that catching up with him was a real possibility.
“He had been thrust out of the house and Father had locked the door already, and as much as anyone begged, he would not allow him admittance.”
The most distressing manifestation of these manic times is that he cannot play his violin. It requires a precise, delicate touch and both an external and an internal stillness and calm that is impossible for him to achieve.
“He ill?” the man demanded suspiciously.
He considered his options. Yes, it was clear that Sherlock was speaking the truth—he truly did not recall a thing about his two years away, and sometimes even his life before that seemed to slip from his grasp.
Mycroft was a bit ashamed of himself—he was so very proud of his little brother for managing this escape so well. The wallet would be returned to its owner by post, of course, with enough cash to cover the cost of the purchases he had put on the credit card—how thoughtful of Sherlock to have stuffed the receipts into the pocket of the (hideous) coat. He had to estimate how much cash he had spent. He didn’t want to think about what he had spent it on, but it was necessary.
“He…” I paused and mentally inventoried his activities. “He hasn’t had a case in a while, and the last one was a bit mundane. I’ve been able to engage him in some minor scientific inquiries pertaining to my medical practice, but more and more often he’s seemed impatient with that. I regret to add that he has been indulging in his cocaine even more than usual, which, as it generally does, leads to impatience, sleepless nights—you know all this.”
“Yeah. Sort of. But then he got to Europe and something about it frightened him.”
“Such as that coronet (he was referring to the jewelled object that had caused so much turmoil in the family we had just made the acquaintance of). Such as jewels in general. How odd it is that some elements taken from the ground are considered special simply because they exist. They serve no useful purpose. Gold and silver, of course, are useful in many ways, as are diamonds and other of the hardest gemstones, but something like an opal, which is exceedingly easy to damage, is valued simply because it is rare. It seems somewhat circuitous. An opal is considered valuable because it does nothing of value.”
Mycroft, who was seated behind the enormous desk in his home office, frowned. Mummy was rarely so short with him. Did she suspect anything? No, of course not. How could she?
I agreed.
And so, she proceeded to explain.
“Does Mrs. Bloom know?” I asked.
The heat of the day bent me to its will and I wilted once more.
a lab
Mycroft introduced himself. He knew that he sounded and looked stiff and uncomfortable. He couldn’t help it; it was habit more than anything. His little brother frowned at him and then reached a trembling hand out for the clipboard. The nurse relinquished it readily.
“Such as?”
which I now possess, and although it makes me faint with disgust, I will lay them out to the authorities so that the proper actions may be taken against the both of you.
to know any different, she most certainly would not implicate us. Defending her slightly mad, violin-playing tenant to the neighbours is one thing. Admitting that she is knowingly harbouring two criminals is another.
Perfect.
“Thank you,” I managed. The brandy was a favourite of mine, but even so it burned my throat, so tight it was.
“No, I forgot that I used it all for an experiment. You will enjoy what I have in my Persian slipper, however. –Sherlock”
And the words he chose— “remarkably badly”? Really? And who is
“Toothbrush in the loo?” she asked. “I bet your mouth is nasty.”
He dropped his eyes to the water covering him. “Mr. Bramsen’s face is very smooth, but sometimes he must shave twice a day to keep it so,” he offered hesitantly.
Finally, he all but collapsed into my lap. As always, he was light and no great burden, and he was cautious about putting his weight on my bad leg. I wrapped my arms around him again and arranged him so that his head was on my shoulder. I had found this to be the most conducive position when we were having a difficult conversation; it allowed him to talk without looking directly at me, and it allowed me to comfort him whilst he did so.
be returning to our rooms—to our lives.”
“You got distracted by what you were reading and forgot that the maid would be up to tend to the fire? And that you were wearing just a shirt?”
I called out to Mrs. Hudson as I let myself in through the street door. I waved weakly at the cabbie and he, seeing that I had gained entry, nodded and touched his whip to his nag and they were off again.
I, however, by necessity, have over the years become rather well-acquainted with the nature of these creatures, including the deadly snakes of India. It is I who feel nothing but chagrin when I realise that I did not immediately point out that the whistle could not have been used to train or retrieve the serpent, because snakes cannot hear. They might at times seem to do so, but they are in fact reacting to the vibrations associated with some sounds. A high whistle such as we heard is something which no snake would detect.
“Please do not be alarmed,” Mycroft instructed, holding his hand up. “Despite my absorption in my responsibilities, I have been considering what I stated earlier, and I wish to revise my words.”
“That sounds perfect,” I replied. “But only if you join me,” I added. The glasses were on our sideboard and I retrieved two.
“Do you wish to tell me in what way?” I prodded.
“You talked to Molly Hooper about
I spent the remainder of my day out. Frustrated at not knowing the outcome of the case, I found the details to which I was privy constantly in my thoughts. Reading of any sort—I had brought one of my yellow-backed novels and a new medical text on the treatment of diseases of the skin—was a lost cause. I found myself running my eyes over a paragraph multiple times without comprehending a single word.
