Cas strips quietly, making sure not to wake Dean up, climbs into their bed like a smooth cat and very gently plasters himself against his back. He can’t resist brushing a soft kiss against the nape of his neck as his hands automatically come to lace together on Dean’s middle, breathing his scent in.
“You did tell me I’d make a really pretty bride just last night, didn’t you?” he laughs. “What’s with all the important questions, Dean?”
Then he woke again, when they stumbled into the room they had been occupying the past few days. He remembers the pain, how fresh the water was as it got poured again and again over his back to wash away the blood, the sharp pain of a needle stitching him back together. A hand always on him. Grounding him, keeping him sane. Fingers on his skin. Lips placing a warm kiss on his forehead as he was lured back into sleep, covers and arms tight around him.
Anyway, I’m getting away from my point here. The point being — we need to talk. I understand this sentence never promises any good, but I think it’s about time I finally come clean. Both you and my brother deserve the truth. It’s been so long already, I don’t even know where to start.
The only thing that’s not a blur in Cas’ mind is the sight of a blue fitted suit, and Dean’s face looking straight at him across the empty space.
For what feels like an eternity, Dean doesn’t say anything and Cas only hears the sounds of his quiet, rapidly quickening breathing as well as the breathy moans that fall off his lips. But when Dean’s voice finally picks up, it’s wrecked and Cas can almost picture his lust-blown pupils all the way from Kansas to Texas.
“Yeah. Yeah you can,” Cas pants a little breathless as he turns around into Dean’s embrace. “Can’t assure you that I’ll be able to return the favor though, I’m literally exhausted.”
In his defense Dean is usually out at this time of day, either running around town with Charlie or having PT at the hospital. So when Castiel pushes the bathroom door with the firm intention of dissolving under the shower spray because work is driving him so crazy he just went for twice his usual run, he’s actually surprised to find Dean looking at himself in the mirror with an expression close to horror on his lips.
, who went through this like a smooth sailor after I dropped these +10k on her barely 48 hours ago 💜
But Cas can’t deal with this, not right now. Not when he’s on the verge of collapsing and all he’s dreaming about is his bed.
Castiel didn’t really mean to say anything about his sexuality to their foster father. But both Dean and Cas have a habit of not being very subtle, and walking in on them getting handsy in the hallway of his own house had been a little too much for a homophobic piece of shit like Gallagher.
“Did he-,” he stutters, voice so brittle that it takes everything out of Jimmy not to break. “Did he say anything?”
But the buzz is too heavy, the thrill coursing through his veins is too delicious, and the words die in his mind before he manages to grasp them. Instead he just laughs softly at his lover’s words, and watches helplessly as Dean’s beautiful eyes grow hurt.
Benny doesn’t even budge, if not for the eyebrow he cocks at him. “Okay. Enough with the pretense. What’s going on, Dean?”
I’m so sorry that it took me so long to come clean. I wish I had done it sooner. I wish it didn’t take you almost getting blown to pieces for me to realize what matters. You always were a better friend than I ever was, and I hope you can find it in yourself to forgive me. Maybe not today, maybe not tomorrow. But someday.
5 minutes later he’s settled on the couch in Benny’s living room, a beer in hand and his friend looking at him expectantly. Nothing’s changed in the past two months, but then again Dean’s not surprised. Benny’s not one for change.
“That’s not fair, Cas. You know what happened 11 years ago was not me. And Benny told me about this barely 6 hours ago, I wanted to sleep on it and read it
It’s then that Hope rises in Castiel’s veins. It’s then that he remembers stars are always there but we miss them in the dirt and clouds, we miss them in the storms.
His resolve starts to crumble after he tosses his bag on the counter and realizes that Dean is sitting on the deck outside. That’s not unusual, he’s found him sitting at the exact same spot a handful of times, usually late at night when he’s unable to sleep.
Cas looks at him curiously as he pushes the cup in front of him. “I have a conference call planned at  11am with one of my editors, and Balthazar might need me to edit something for one of the pieces he’s been working on. Why?”
But you looked at us differently. For you, fate had written our story long before we met. I have to admit, for a while you made me wonder if it was true, if we really were meant to be.
Thank you so much for all the beautiful comments you've been leaving on this story and into my Tumblr ask box over the past few weeks. I can't tell you guys how much this fuels me. Whenever I feel down I come here and I re-read it all, and it's literally what's been keeping me going. I'm so glad that these versions of Dean and Cas (and our pal Jimmy) speak to so many of you, as much as they speak to me.
Charlie and Jo have had something going on for a couple of months, but since neither of them have said anything to anyone yet, Dean had been keeping his observations to himself. But if anything, the smile that appears on Charlie’s face is enough of a confirmation.
He makes his way back to the living room and instantly catches Balthazar who’s already looking at him expectantly.
. That’s why his dirty talk in bed can sometimes get him to come almost untouched, and Cas is able to stay as cool as a cucumber while saying things like “
Dean seems to think for a second before something breaks in his eyes, like a little light bulb in the shadow of the green in his eyes.
“I don’t know. I think on some level it was still too much for me to handle, with everything that was going on with me- with us. To be fair it still is.”
“Cas…” he almost whispers as he takes in Castiel’s state gradually, from his wounded hands to the quivering of his lower lip.
“I know I will never be good enough to be a soldier anymore but I was hoping to get a little support here,” he scoffs, looking down on his feet. “Guess not.”
It almost resonates into Cas’ bones, the way Dean’s voice is barely a whisper but the weight of it all is so consequent he feels it drop into his stomach. He can feel Dean’s hand on his back stopping, the way Dean’s head fits more tightly against the top of his, or the slight acceleration of his breathing.
She rolls her eyes at him. “I’m still mad at you, but wallowing is not going to change anything right now. The bottom line here is you need to tell them.”
But he’s also worn out. Exhausted to have to provide for everyone, to have to work his ass off when Cas is spending his money on stuff to get him high, that is most likely going to get him killed. Drained that he has to fight every day with barely any support system.
“I think we both needed some time apart to figure out what we wanted to do. Jimmy dying changed a lot of things for me, and then figuring out that Jimmy lied to us to keep us separated brought a whole other set of consequences on the table.”
Okay so “an appointment with a doctor” might be the easiest way to put down the fact that he’s seeing a therapist, and for the first time in his entire life it comes straight from his own volition.
Dean breaks again, and Cas is at a loss for words. In the past almost 20 years of knowing him, he’s almost positive this is the most Dean has ever talked about his feelings. And it doesn’t matter that his heart is in his throat right now. It doesn’t matter that tears are starting to well up in his eyes because he feels Dean’s pain and he knows that he’s not going to be able to heal it on the spot. It doesn’t matter that his stomach churns at how much he needs to hold him close.
It’s pushing 4 am when the last remnant of their friends — a drunk Charlie, a slightly less drunk Jess, and a sober Sam to take them home — finally leave. Cas is slightly drunk, just pleasantly enough to enjoy the quiet buzz that suppresses his nerves. Dean is a bit more affected, and is currently laughing at God knows what while he’s doing the last bit of dishes that are left.
He’s coming home from a night shift, hoping to catch at least 4 hours of sleep before he has to be up again to go to school. They moved in 4 months ago and it’s been a dream to finally be able to live freely- but it also has its own cons.
I don’t think I’ll ever stop missing you with every stretching fiber of who I am. I think about calling you every day. I think about finding my way in front of your door every single moment this Earth has made. But I won’t ever do these things because I meant it when I said I’d do anything for you to be happy again. And I know all too well that you’ve been happier without having to carry the load of my own demons on your shoulders. I know how much it hurt trying to love me, and I’ll never put that on you again.
Bobby watches him from head to toe before he steps aside to allow Dean in. He makes his way to the living room immediately, watching as Bobby goes back to his desk and sits on his chair.
It’s been more than a year since I wrote to you last. For a long time I wondered if it was doing more bad than good, if writing to you was just a way for me to keep you with me. So I stopped. I buried myself in booze and women, tried to self-destruct with too much work and not enough sleep, and you know what?
“Yeah?” Dean asks, tentatively brushing his hand against the denim of Cas’ pants where his rock-hard cock is strained against the line of his zipper. “What do you want, Cas?”
When Dean picks up, his voice is clearer somehow. Like he’s picked up a thread and knows where he’s going.
He opens his eyes again then but doesn’t dare to look at Dean. Not now, not yet. Not when the air is so heavy he has trouble breathing.
The hammer comes down in the early hours of morning, on a random day right before Christmas. Dean is lying in the middle of their bed, still covered in sweat from the sex they just had, and eyes Cas as the other man scrambles to find his running clothes in the mess of discarded and mixed-up clothes on the dresser.
“Not like I ever picked up the phone either, kid,” Bobby grumbles, and the knot in Dean’s chest eases a little. “You’re not the only one who’s to blame here.”
“On what plane of existence would I ever say no to you, Cas?” he asks, and it takes barely a second for Cas to realize how breathless he sounds.
“Yeah, that’s very much like him,” Cas laughs for the first time in a week. It actually makes him feel a bit giddy, seeing as he still
“You’re the best,” Dean answers, jumping from the bed where he’s been sorting through stuff they’re getting to Goodwill, and what they’re keeping.
“Yes, I booked my weekly appointment with Dr. Mayer at Lawrence General. Every Tuesday and Thursday. Don’t worry about me.”
I also told you that maybe this wasn’t meant to be. I didn’t mean a single word of that phrase. I think it was always you, from the second breath graced my lungs. I guess the journey from that moment to you was just harder than it should have been. It took more from me than I knew how to give.
“I’m not skipping the funeral Sammy, quit it,” Dean answers as he uncaps the bottle. “Besides, I ain’t staying here, I booked a motel room for the next two weeks until I can find something.”
“I don’t know what’s going on inside of this pretty little head of yours, but I’m gonna need you to lay off the self-loathing for a hot minute and look at the bigger picture here.
He aches for his brother- for everything he’s missing, for everything he’s done, for the anger he still feels toward him because it’s easier being mad at someone who isn’t here anymore than trying to forgive. He weeps because he misses him. He weeps because Dean does too.
Benny became Dean’s Team Leader a few months after Dean joined Bravo. He’s the team’s #1, the one in charge of everyone. A soldier that had been shaped by war and who always gives everything on any battlefield. A man who would do anything to protect his team, viewed every single one of the members as brothers. Dean had looked up to him as an example of what he wanted to become both as a man and as a soldier.
“I think it’s stupidly arousing in ways that shouldn’t be allowed for the average person,” Dean fires back immediately, an edge of yearning piercing through his rough voice.
On a much more personal note, because I feel like I can share that in this space with you, tomorrow will mark 10 years since I got clean. This story is a testament to that journey, one that I hope I can convey through Cas and the people that gravitate around him, and one that's been extremely cathartic to write. If you're reading this and you're struggling with substance abuse, know that you can reach out, and know that there's a light at the end of the tunnel whenever you're ready to grasp it.
He drags his exhausted body through the corridor and finds Cas back in bed, lying in fetal position, his blue eyes staring in the distance.
The kid is perhaps a tiny bit taller than him. He sports short sandy-brown hair and has the most vibrant green eyes Castiel has ever seen in his life. His face is covered in tiny golden freckles and if Cas didn’t know better, he’d think they’d been put there just like the stars have been put in the sky.
But that’s unfair. Cas told him he loved him this morning, all the while lying against him, his face pressed against his chest. Cas told him he loved him and Dean said he was sorry. Because Dean, of all the adjectives that characterize him the most, is a full-blown idiot. He managed to hurt Cas all over again.
Kissing Cas inside his car, stopped on the side of the road while the sun set in front of them. It’s just like coming home.
“He’s an ex-addict who doesn’t have any family left and who just lost a part of himself. And truth be told, I couldn’t stand my motel room anymore anyway, so that was a win-win situation.”
Cas just sits there, sipping his coffee, a look of profound pride on his face, and a definite smugness dancing in his eyes.
It’s not just three words casually thrown into the wind. It doesn’t just cover the two months they’ve just spent apart. It’s an acknowledgment of the past decade they’ve spent away from each other.
Castiel hears the doors creak and the recognizable sound of Dean’s footsteps a while after he’s gone to bed. He’s already halfway into sleep when the bed dips and Dean’s naked chest comes into contact with his back, warmth seeping through his skin at the contact as Dean plasters himself against him.
It’s more difficult to admit aloud than he’d like to say. Harder to say it to Dean than it’s been to admit himself. But in the end the balm lies in Dean’s eyes as they catch his, Dean’s mouth capturing his in another kiss, Dean’s hands clutching him impossibly closer.
Sometimes it’s in the late hours of the night after a crisis as he’s sitting on the deck and Cas hasn’t let go of him for an hour, and breathes an “
But Cas has other ideas in mind. He places his fingers on Dean’s lips, shaking his head slightly so that their noses brush, an evil smirk dancing on his lips.
No one could have predicted this turn of events. Truth be told, when Dean decided to enlist 10 years back, it came as a surprise to practically everyone around him. He slowly worked his way up the ladder and became one of the youngest Navy SEALs to ever make Chief Petty Officer after only 7 years on the Teams.
Some days I wake and feel the emptiness already flooding the room, the yearning mounting in my throat. But it's not the cavity in my chest that keeps me awake, it's that I have no idea what I'm supposed to fill it with.
“You look beautiful,” Cas repeats, relishing the blush on Dean’s chest as he murmurs it into his mouth. “Are you gonna come for me now?”
There was a time when the story of you was the story of me, where both of our lives were deeply embedded into each other. All of the choices we made, the trauma we endured, the pieces we lost; all of it led us to one another.
“With m-my cowboy hat on,” Dean struggles to say and despite the fact that it’s barely been 10 minutes, Cas knows he’s close.
“So big that we’re having it on the floor of our newly bought house after having tacos on a random night,” Dean laughs before diving down for another kiss on Cas’ lips. “God, I love you.”
Their hands resting next to Cas’ head stay intertwined tightly and Dean’s head drops into the hollow of Cas’ shoulder and neck, breathing in the scent of him, all salt and sweat. Cas’ mouth stays pressed against his hairline as both their breathing starts slowing down gradually.
~ May 7, 2021. Exactly one year after Jimmy's death. Situated after chapter 19 but before chapter 20. They still live in the apartment.
They still both go to therapy. Dean still has physical therapy to attend once every two weeks, but his leg and hip are solid enough now that you won’t know anything happened to him by just watching him walk or run. Cas keeps going to his NA meeting without missing a beat, navigating the highs and lows of his addiction like a smooth sailor in a tamed storm. They go to Jimmy’s grave once every week, bringing different flowers and sometimes a bottle of whisky.
Sam is looking at him with his puppy eyes, the bastard, and it takes a lot out of Dean to keep himself from making an instant decision.
It’s a distinct sound between a scream and a sob, loud enough so that it tears through the silence of the night and hits Cas’ ears even before his eyes open. Once they do, he’s out of bed and into the corridor in close to no time before he throws Dean’s bedroom door open.
A couple of beers and whiskeys later, he ends up sleeping in his childhood bed because he’s a bit too drunk to be allowed behind the wheel. Bobby ushers him upstairs around midnight and Dean has barely collapsed with the comforter on the single bed when his phone rings.
Dean turns his head to catch his eyes, but there’s no heat in them. A twinkle of fear, and Cas knows what he thinks. If it goes the same way as the first time, it will crush him.
“Okay. Alright, okay,” he says, eyes closed. “I’m still sorry for what I said though. I’m just- Turning 30 is scary somehow and we’re spending so little time together lately, I just want to spend that night with you here. You know?”
Cas laughs as Dean leans in for one more kiss before they finally start actually using the shower for what it is.
Some secluded part of his brain realizes that he’s following the same path as he did a decade ago; being scared out of his mind that Cas might be dying and that he might never see him again, running like an absolute madman through the same hospital’s corridor. There’s probably a joke to be made about how similar the situations are, but Dean’s mind doesn’t stop to think, doesn’t want to remember about the pain and the loss and the tears and the heartache anymore. It only wants to find Cas, to make sure he’s okay, to make sure he’s
When Cas slides onto the Impala’s bench he looks lighter. Softer. There’s a hint of a smile as he turns to look at Dean, and Dean can’t help but return it.
Frowning his way to the door, he quickly runs through the people that could decide to pop by unannounced at 8 pm until he sees the silhouette through the door and realizes that it’s probably Balthazar.
How do you explain to an outsider whatever the hell happened between Dean and him without sounding like an absolute freak, or going on a 2-hour rant?
Dean is the one driving Benny back to Kansas City Airport since Cas has to attend several work meetings this afternoon. He watches them as they exchange a hug on the sidewalk, his heart bursting at the sight of his boyfriend and best friend getting along so well. One quick kiss on Cas’ lips later and they’re off on the road.
“I’m… it’s going to take some time for me,” Cas starts, his voice low, and he can feel Dean’s hand tightening on his shoulder, offering comfort. “I understand why you did it. We’re still… we’re still
“Okay, you’ve got this. Jimmy’s not here to calm you down, buddy. You’re gonna have to do this on your own,” he mutters. “Oh God that’s it, I’m officially going crazy. Fuck.”
“You came back,” Cas says, his voice weak as Dean gradually comes closer and establishes several points of contact like he’s learned to.
“Yeah, yeah,” Dean scoffs as he gets up before bending down again and kissing Cas one last time. “I love you.”
Dean really does his best to ignore how the words just cut through him, but it’s hard not to let the smile fall from his face. He retrieves his hand then, clutching the cup of coffee against his chest instead.
Sometimes you come across a person who just makes everything feel bearable, feel like it’s been worth all the pain. You were that person to me, even after we parted.
“I don’t know. I see why he’s pissed and I’m sorry about how things went down. But he also kept talking shit about how I tried to be a hero when joining the army and… he doesn’t know shit about what I went through.”
“Don’t go,” Castiel repeats, his voice starting to rise and Dean instantly knows he’s getting close. “Don’t go, please, don’t go.”
When he wakes up Cas is still awake, petting his hair tenderly as he watches the rain still pouring out the window.
Cas draws in a breath, his mind automatically wandering back to his painful apology from earlier this morning and the look on Dean’s face last night when he lost it on him. Balthazar seems to notice something is wrong, judging by the glimmer of interrogation in his eyes.
I miss you. I still love you. I wish my heart could stop searching for you. Would stop aching when it realizes it can’t reach you anymore.
After that, everything is fuzzy for him. He remembers the rumble of the Impala beneath him. A hand on his chest, never leaving him as they drove. The quiet hum of a Zeppelin song, the sound of the first few chords of “The Battle of Evermore” echoing against the bends of the car and into Dean’s chest. The hand moving from his chest to trace the line of his jaw fleetingly, thumbing at the cut on his bottom lip and drawing a sharp hiss from his mouth. He sank again, into the cottony comfort of the dark.
Castiel smiles, this time easily, warmth spreading into his face as Charlie smiles back at him. It’s nice to remember he still has friends, even when you’re stuck inside shades of grey.
Which is stupid, they just had tremendous sex, Dean just let Cas take control for the first time since they’ve started having sex again…
Dean freezes then, turning slowly to look at him, and Cas watches the journey on his face before it becomes clear as day that Dean seems
Cas, who left this bed that’s now feeling cold and empty, but his scent somehow still lingering on Dean’s pillow.
“I grew angry at you because I watched first hand how heavy it weighed on Sam. And you didn’t explain anything. Sammy shakily told me that you left for the army but at the time I don’t think he even knew which corps. Then I had to track the Novaks, and James told me.”
But long story short, his doctor had recommended someone named Dr. Kowalski, telling him that this was a good step and that the therapist was used to treating veterans. Dean wrote down the name and number, pondering calling her once he’d be back in the quietness of his own room at home later today.
Balthazar shakes his hand steadily. “I’d love to say I heard a lot about you, but Cas has been holding out on details, actually.”
“If I hadn’t pushed him away he would never have joined the Navy,” Jimmy argues, pain rocketing through his body at the thought of Dean lying alone in a sanitized room.
“Would you mind uh-” Cas softens his tone, nibbling at Dean’s bottom lip. “Having extremely vigorous sexual intercourse with me, in the prospect of reaching climax together?”
Dean can’t help the shiver that courses through him at hearing Benny’s voice, suddenly very controlled and measured.
wished Cas had picked up. Because hearing his raspy voice even through the phone would have helped ease his nerves.
Every now and then Dean will tell him, at any given point. Sometimes they’re on the couch watching one of Cas’ favorite stupid tv show and Dean will turn to look at him and say
“You’d have to move back to Virginia. And you’d be gone a lot again,” Charlie starts, her voice thin. “What is it you two used to tell me? Ten months out of twelve?”
Benny scoffs. “Truth be told brother, I worry way more about you now, knowing that you’re back in middle-America than I did when we were running through rain of bullets in the Middle East.”
And there’s really nothing that Cas would love more than staying. Enjoying the warmth and weight of Dean against him, breathing the scent of him. Forgetting for a minute that everything in his life has been crashing around him for the past three months.
But Dean apparently became a master at schooling his features somewhere between the past two months and a decade ago, and he plasters a smile on his face instead.
Dean exhales. Benny should think about moonlighting as a fortune-teller once he’s done with his enlistment.
It’s also some sort of a bad omen. Dean never gets up before 6 unless he’s had some sort of crisis. He keeps telling himself he’s had enough of a decade having to run around regardless of his sleep schedule, so he enjoys sleeping in and doing nothing.
A hand gently removing his hair from his forehead, a single kiss on his eyebrow, and he sees it. Green, the color of his eyes. A flash of honey in his irises, twisted by something that must be Fear. A tear rolling down his cheek.
“Dean we’re not married,” Cas laughs against him as they enter the room, but melts into Dean’s embrace. “And this isn’t bridal style.”
. But when we met… you always made me feel all of those things. We were only 10, and I was already just an angry little boy with a deadbeat dad and a dead mom, a little brother to care for and not even 20 bucks to my name. Yet you made me feel like I belonged, like I was meant to be something greater than anyone had ever thought. I was nothing, and yet you and Jimmy saw worth in me. You both came into my life and claimed me as one of your own, and for the first time ever I was finally someone worth a shot.”
“From what I understand, he posted this the night he got killed in that convenience store,” Dean murmurs in his hair after a while, running his hand in soothing circles on Cas’ back. “He went out, dropped this off in a collection box, swung by the convenience store to buy some stuff. Never made it home.”
He sits up on the bench, making sure he is welcomed before invading Castiel’s space. The other man doesn’t make a move, his eyes fixated on the river. He’s wearing his godforsaken pair of dark grey sweatpants that Dean is sure he’s seen more in the past month than ever before and a ratty old shirt only barely covered by a hoodie that Dean’s pretty sure is Jimmy’s.
Ray is 37 and he was in the Marines, just like John. And he’s been living with one leg for the past 8 years.
And it’s true. He went to NA earlier this afternoon because he felt like shit. His editor over at LJ World busted his balls about a deadline that he kept pushing, rightfully so. He’s growing tired of his job and once again considering another career path with no idea where to go.
Cas smiles, his gaze still on the sky. The stars are still shining bright and Dean’s warmth is already wrapping around him, the distinct scent of him — motor oil, cologne, hair gel, mint shampoo — heavy in his nose. He feels good. Scratch that, he feels fucking
“Talk for yourself, Novak,” Balt scoffs, taking a sip of his drink. “So what is it now? Did you discover that Jimmy wasn’t actually your brother? Or that Dean is a bounty hunter? What?”
For what it’s worth, he really tries to put on his best face as Cas turns to look at him, a smile on his face. Of course Cas is happy to go, home is in London for him now, not in hot, suffocating Kansas. No matter how much Dean wants him to be here.
“What-,” Cas starts then stops, turning his head to catch Dean's eyes, the white color of the envelope in his hand contrasting with the tan color of his skin. “What’s this?”
, Cas thinks as he sits on the kitchen island, his feet in the air, watching the other man’s back as Dean starts whistling dramatically wrong and chuckles to himself.
Cas nods as Dean rises from his seat and kisses his cheek before heading down the bunker garage to prep his Lady.
“Just eat,” she sighs. “In case you’ve forgotten, I’m driving you to PT in 10. You haven’t eaten anything ever since you came in this morning.”
“Shitty self-esteem, probably,” Dean snickers, feeling lighter now that he let it all out. “You know, the Winchester syndrome.”
He’s having a hard time finding more superlatives right now, but that’s probably what staring at the ceiling for countless hours is for anyway.
It takes a second for his eyes to adjust to the darkness of the room. When they finally do, Castiel realizes that Dean is not in bed but curled up on the floor. His arms are wrapped around his knees, his head resting into his hands, his entire body shaking with the violence of his crisis.
Dean smiles, his hand catching the small hair at the nape of Cas’ neck. He’s beautiful like this, only wearing boxers and Dean’s old Zeppelin shirt. His hair mussed and all soft against him, his frame only highlighted by the moonlight outside.
Cas doesn’t make a single movement but Dean immediately goes for his warmth as he plasters himself against his side, finding “his” spot in the v-shape of his neck and breathing in. He drops a soft kiss where Castiel’s shoulder meets his neck, smiling when Cas lets out a silent little huff.
,” Balt adds, understanding visibly dawning on him. “So you think that it’s possible he got jealous, on top of thinking that your relationship with Dean might be toxic in regards to your drug use?”
“It’s not,” Charlie says as she goes willingly, Dean wrapping her in a hug. “I know it’s not okay. I just kept praying that you’d eventually figure it out, and when you came back to Lawrence I thought for sure that you’d be working it out pretty quickly but you never did and I—,”
” she said with tears in her eyes before crushing Dean into a hug), and matching custom made knives for Bobby and Jo.
“I don’t know, man. We’ll probably never know, and right now I just can’t be around Cas without wanting to tear my own heart out. So I’m here. Is that enough of an explanation?”
The dam breaks suddenly, tears start rolling down on his cheeks as Dean sits on the deck, legs hanging from the edge. His sobs echo through the night as the sun dips just below the horizon.
But there’s also a part of him that knows that staying will just hurt as much. That Dean doesn’t want whatever’s left between the two of them. That the pieces which got crushed over the past 10 years are past saving.
There’s something indecipherable into Cas’ eyes as he answers. “I don’t know. I thought it would be fun. The last party we had here was Jimmy’s Christmas party, I kinda feel like it would be nice to just have… friends over again.” He moves to dump his empty cup in the trash before turning back to Dean. “But it’s fine if you don’t want to. It’s just an idea.”
To conclude: thank you for your comments/reactions/kudos/subscriptions, to those who reached out on Tumblr or Twitter. You're the fuel to my writing tank (good lord, I need to work on my analogies) 💜
Cas smiles at him, something genuine and not at all what Dean had expected. “Thank you.” A beat, and then, “Will you wait for me?”
since Dean moved in, which is fine granted he usually doesn’t wake up with the man pressed against his chest.
Cas chooses this moment to move into his arms, slightly readjusting his face into the crook of Dean’s neck, his lips grazing the skin of his throat and sending a shiver down Dean’s spine, and his mind comes to a halt.
He gets one last drag out of his cigarette before crushing the stub into the ashtray next to him and getting up on his feet. Dean slowly looks up at him, his mind too cluttered to say anything.
“Thanks Cas, I think that’s probably good enough that I can sleep now,” he said, wiggling his shoulders to dislodge Cas’s hands. “Can you throw the covers over me?”
“I don’t have any objections. It’s just… people have said that. About us. Over the years. Called us boyfriends. It hurt, being taunted about what I wanted so badly but could never have.”
“On your knees,” Cas said. Dean complied, even as his knees complained at him as they hit the hard tile floor. He started with a tentative little lick, then another. Cas seemed happy to let Dean write the script here, so he continued with the teasing little flicks of his tongue as he stroked him slowly. This was always a fun way to warm up, to tease Cas until he was so needy that he took what he wanted from Dean - which, Dean had discovered, was even more fun.
Cas made a choked little sound of surprised delight. His hand tightened on Dean’s arm, and Dean thought he might be about to burst into tears, when someone cleared their throat just behind his shoulder.
Dean slid his hands inside, curving around Cas’s ass, squeezing and kneading as he worked the fabric down Cas’s body. He ran his hands down Cas’s thighs, enjoying the feel of the strong, thick muscles there, the scratch of the hair, and the way Cas trembled when he stroked his inner thighs.
“Can you make salad?” she asked. She started pulling vegetables from the fridge and piled them in his arms. “Go nuts.”
Sam had been heading through the park, trying to find a good spot for the parade. He’d lost track of the time after another frustrating string of texts with Eileen. He only hoped that he could find the two couples and at least try to seem fine and normal for the duration of the festival day.
And soon Dean was being helped onto a gurney and nurses were clustering around him, poking IV needles in, sticking an oxygen mask over his face, clipping monitors on him, and removing his clothes. He saw Cas and Sam, back in the corners of the examination room, watching everything with big, scared eyes.
Sam smiled. He’d know that voice anywhere, and he was happy enough to hear it that he didn’t even mind one more come-on. He spun around on the bar stool. “Well look at you, all alive again.”
Back at the house, they parted ways early. Sylvia had some revisions to a project to get done for work, and Cas went downstairs and laid in bed and called Dean, who’d texted half an hour earlier to say that he was stopping for the night.
Castiel blinked. He hadn’t quite been expecting that. “Well. If you had asked me, I would have told you that… yes, we are risking some unknown outcome, with something of this magnitude. Even if we don’t know what it might be… we never seem to know until it happens, do we? And yet, this is the right thing to do. We risk things to save people. Especially family. That’s who you are, and who you taught me to be.”
. He’ll love it on you. You’ve gotta.” Castiel looked skeptical, but he stuck the shirt in the cart.
Sylvia put down the piece of cheese in her hand. Everything she’d eaten suddenly felt sour in her stomach, and she bolted to the bathroom and threw it all up. Gabriel dead, Gabriel being tortured for years, why hadn’t she done something sooner?! Surely she could have done something. She sat on the floor in front of the toilet and cried again.
Gabriel broke a mozzarella stick and pulled it apart, staring at the cheese string in fascination. “Good, because I don’t think I could have dealt with that. Guess we should, you know, talk about… stuff.”
Sam drew a deep breath. “Eileen Leahy. She’s really amazing. Smart. Doesn’t take any bullshit from anyone. Better hunter than I am, really.” He sipped at his beer. Gabriel caught his eye in the mirror behind the bar, and he noticed the fleeting look of sadness before Sam hid it away.
“Sam, we’ve got bigger news than that,” Dean interrupted before any further discussion of his karaoke exploits could occur. “Gabriel’s back.”
“Peachy. Apparently we all didn’t exist for a while but then Jack put us back again, which I never even would have known if Sam didn’t-”
They brought in a wheelchair, and Sam and Cas came back and listened attentively to the discharge instructions while the young student helped Dean from the gurney to the chair. He was able to take the few steps, though he had to lean way too much on this surprisingly strong girl. His legs still felt heavy and wobbly, and he was exhausted as he settled into the chair.
Castiel’s phone pinged. -In NJ. About an hour out. Car is still acting up tho- A moment later another message came in. -Can’t wait to see you-
“Break a leg, sweetheart,” Dean said as Cas stumbled his way toward the stage, assisted by Sylvia giving him an arm to lean on. “Oh god he’s so drunk,” Dean giggled delightfully, looking at the three empty glasses by his plate. “Shit, where’s my phone?” As the song started playing and Castiel looked at the microphone in his hand, Dean started recording.
Sam grinned. “That’s great, because what I wanted to tell you is, Claire texted me this morning, she’s going to be there too. She wants us to come.”
The waitress came back with Cas’s ice cream and the check. She put the check down next to Dean, gave them both a friendly smile, and walked away.
They walked out through the kitchen, across the deck and into the yard. Cas was barefoot, but the soft, cool ground didn’t seem to bother him. His dark blue jeans were cuffed to keep them from dragging in the grass, and he wore a lighter blue polo shirt nearly exactly the color of his eyes. A little weird to see him in different clothes. Not bad weird, but unsettling. It was a lot shifting at once, but Cas’s hand in his was soothing, grounding.
“Something like that,” Cas said casually. “I thought you might like that.” He continued to finger him, each stroke with a nudge to his prostate, just enough to make him crave more.
“Target practice,” Claire shrugged. “I guess. I mean… it would have been a nice present for Jack but that dumbass had to go off and be god instead of being my weird brother or whatever, so. Yeah. I dunno.” She shoved the bear into Dean’s arms. “Carry this back to the car, would ya? Are we leaving soon or what?” She started off down the pathway.
“Sam…” Dean said. “Yeah okay. I’ve got a guy.” He’d wanted to wait until Cas was in the room and they could announce it together, but it seemed like he was just going to get it all over with at once.
She found him on the back deck, sitting on the creaky old glider watching the sparrows and finches crowd around the bird feeder.
“It’s okay,” he said, waving a hand dismissively, as if she’d scratched his car with a shopping cart. “It’s likely that was the only way I could get out, and this is… much preferable.”
“It’s eyeliner,” Cas said proudly. “Claire suggested it. She wears it and we have similar features. It’s even cruelty-free.”
He ducked behind the Impala with his bag of clothes. Jeans, socks, dry t-shirt. Nothing to do about shoes though, and he didn’t have so much as a flannel in this bag, nevermind a jacket. Everything else was back at the motel.
Sam chuckled a little. “Yeah, um. Well I have some books, if you want.” There was the rustling of Sam digging through his bag, and the soft thunk of a stack of books being set on the nightstand.
Castiel insisted on washing the dishes after dinner, and he scrubbed the counters and the stovetop as well, while trying to explain to Sylvia a little more of the confusing web of their family. It was a lot, and she really wasn’t sure she understood much.
“You gotta at least get me this last bit, baby,” he pleaded. He turned the key again. Nothing, not a thing. Dean smacked his head off the steering wheel and went back inside the truck stop to ask around for a jump start.
Claire was leaned sideways in one of the plastic chairs, as if daring it to break or wobble on her. Her bare feet were in Kaia’s lap, and Kaia was painting her toenails a dark green. Claire was twisting floral wire and fake flowers into flower crowns. The first one she completed, she tossed toward Cas. It landed on his knees, and he scooped it up and placed it on his head.
, just some powerful weapon. I know it’s not as simple as that but… would have been nice to be liked.”
Dean snapped his fingers. “I knew I forgot about something while I was slaving away in a hot kitchen for hours to feed you all.”
Sylvia decided that lipstick could wait and that she urgently needed to look at bathroom cleaner three aisles away.
,” Dean said. “The last time you were human, because I couldn’t take care of you properly. Nothing about that was alright!”
“Ya think?” Sam snorted, reaching for a chip and dunking it in the artichoke dip. “This is gonna come off the wrong way, I’m sure, but I think she doesn’t really have a right to complain if that’s what she told you. And if she doesn’t want to make the effort to be honest with you… maybe she’s not… maybe this isn’t good for you, either.”
The search for the bones to salt and burn had not been an easy one, and finally a tip from a contractor who’d worked on the place years ago led them to the fact that the lady had been buried in a small family cemetery on the farm where she’d lived. So they went there and found that the farm was abandoned and run-down, but after some stomping around in overgrown weeds they finally found the knee-high wooden fencing around the graves. The marker was a simple cross with just the years scratched into it, but that was confirmation enough for the Winchesters. Sam lost the toss and began digging while Dean kept an eye out.
Cas sighed and watched the door as the young woman came in, got her bag of take-out food, and left. Later, when he got his coat back, it was suffused with the heat and scent of Dean, and he smiled to himself as he pulled it back on.
“Well there’s no sense in you suffering needlessly,” Castiel said. He stopped Dean with a hand to his shoulder, then pulled his coat off and held it out for him. Dean slipped his arms into the sleeves before he even really thought about it. He pulled it close around his body, soaking in the warmth of the angel that still clung to it.
“Oho, the Righteous Man himself is going to try to tell me that I’m a good guy too,” Gabriel snarked. “Oh, this is great. Yeah, Dean, guess what. There’s a few differences between you and me.”
“I’m here for you if you should ever need to discuss the transition into humanity,” Castiel said. “Going through it for the second time myself, I think I may have some insight.”
Cas was fast; he’d nearly reached Dean’s bedroom before Gabriel had even gotten to the hallway. “Dean?!” he exclaimed. “What’s wrong?”
“I don’t regret what I did,” Cas said. “And I certainly didn’t expect to be brought back. I hope that phoning you wasn’t a mistake.”
“Yeah. Yeah, I guess so.” He scratched his head and looked down at the floor. “It’s just that… that’s how I think of you, sometimes, and then- then I remember that that’s not how you see us, and…”
“I’ll be in my office; I need to get some work in. Let me know if you need to talk afterward. But you’d better call him.” Sylvia disappeared down the hallway into her home office and left Castiel alone at the kitchen table with his thoughts of Dean Winchester.
“Ahh, well,” Gabriel stammered. “Lot easier when they’re constructs of your own imagination. Or well compensated to show an interest in you. Or the occasional deity throwing themself at you out of nowhere.” He shrugged.
That was not the only thing in the bag. Three feathers were tucked into the bag as well, flanking the little glass bottle. With human senses, Castiel could never identify the owner of the grace in that bottle, but he knew without a doubt where those tawny golden feathers had come from.
Castiel nearly dropped the phone. “What else did Sam tell you about how things went down? Did they- is Chuck dead?”
They sat down to dinner, and surprisingly nothing was weird. Everything was… perfectly normal. Just the four of them catching up on everything, eating and drinking and laughing together. Dean kept catching Cas’s eye over the table, holding his gaze for too long, a little breathless and thinking, Sam’s right. This is exactly how we’ve been for a long time.
After breakfast, Sylvia and Gabriel walked out to the car with them. Hugs were exchanged all around. Sylvia squeezed Castiel tightly, not wanting to let him go. “You’d better text me all the time,” she said. “I want to hear everything. Come back soon, you two. And you,” she pointed at Dean. “Take good care of him.”
He’d noticed the last few days that the headlights and dash lights were dim, and yesterday it was sluggish to start. He couldn't remember the last time he’d had to replace the alternator, so it shouldn’t have been a surprise. Just very bad timing.
Dean made a satisfied little noise, his expression slack and stunned, though that soon settled into a lazy grin. Castiel dropped onto the bed next to him, too trembly to hold himself up anymore.
“You’re the one who would be interfering by trying to keep this invitation from Sam. And it’s both of our brothers in this case. You can’t just lock Sam away in a tower because he is attracted to Gabriel and you don’t like him-”
Sylvia felt like a bucket of ice water had been dumped over her head. “What?” she heard herself asking, her voice sounding far away. It couldn’t be true.
It was dumb to even think about it, he told himself as he opened his camera roll and scrolled through the folder of photos of Cas. Because Cas was just his buddy, his best friend in the world, and the more Dean thought about how fluttery in the stomach Cas made him feel, about how he wanted to lean in and kiss him every time they stood close, and brush his hair back from his forehead, and lean on his shoulder during movie nights - the more Dean let himself think about these things, the more likely it was that he’d do something unforgiveably stupid and make their friendship awkward and then Cas would find reasons to avoid them even more. And as sucky as an unrequited crush on the bestie was, losing him over it would be devastating. Dean stared at the little cluster of trees behind the barn and sighed.
The sister and her boyfriend had rushed from the barn to the pond when they saw the commotion. Once Dean made it to shore, they hustled the kid over to their car and got her out of the wet clothes and into dry things. Dean stood there on the shore, dripping and shivering. Sam and Jack were out behind the barn, working on the pyre to deal with the bodies of the werewolves, and Dean knew that he should get changed and go help them.
“Guess that was his turning point,” Dean said. “After that, he was more willing to help us. We wouldn’t have managed to save the world if it wasn’t for him, you know. It’s too bad he didn’t come to us instead of his pagan freak friends.”
shit yes, right there. Fuck my ass just like that sweetheart,” he babbled, interspersed with nonsensical utterings and screams. He was writhing on the bed now, it was all Cas could do to hold onto him and keep fucking him exactly like he asked. Cas’s hands were still slippery from the lube and now the sweat pouring off them both, and he had to dig his fingers in to hold on.
“I know it was very rash of me, but, I… Dean I could easily have lost you today, and I must confess that it has me very rattled.” He stared down at the floor, unable to look Dean in the face.
Dean shrugged. “Cas, you don’t have to. I really just wanted to spoil you, but… I mean, play if you wanna play.”
It was Dean who ended up caught off guard, when five minutes later he found Eileen Leahy walking out of the insurance saleslady’s booth with a shiny purple bottle opener.
Most of the hotel rooms around Lincoln were booked solid, but fortunately there was a cheap motel just outside of town that was too skeezy to attract much interest. Claire and Kaia had already gotten a room and texted the Winchesters about it. There were just two rooms left when they arrived Friday afternoon, and they snagged them both.
“I’m… not?” Gabriel said in confusion. “I mean, I’m not a hundred percent, but…” his eyes flared with blue light for a moment. “I’ve still got it.”
“Dean, really,” Cas sighed. “Eat your sandwich. Yes, I would like to see the drag show. I have no idea if it’s my ‘thing’ or not but I’m interested in experiencing all sorts of entertainment. There’s no reason you need to come along if you don’t wish to. Sam and I can go to the show and you can have some time to yourself to explore the festival.”
“I’m not sure we should behave like that in public,” Cas said as they disentangled, his face flushed nearly the same maroon as his t-shirt.
“Everywhere,” Cas moaned. “Think my arm is broken. Maybe a rib, I don’t… I suppose I… am I on Earth?”
“Good plan. Great plan,” she agreed as he dove in to suck on her throat near her collarbone. He tugged down the zipper at the front of her housecoat and slid his hand inside the tank top beneath, curving it around her breast and squeezing with an appreciative sigh. He rubbed his thumb over her nipple, and when she gasped, he chuckled and thrust against her, turning her gasp into a needy moan.
“Let’s meet back out here at 8?” Sam suggested as he gathered up the empty pizza boxes to take them to the dumpster. “I should call Eileen,” he mused, heaving a sigh as he trudged across the parking lot.
Dean eyed the two of them, Sam then Eileen, then their joined hands. “Got a call on the ol’ prayer phone and zipped out of here like his ass was on fire.”
Sylvia’s part finally came around and she was a pretty decent singer, it turned out. A little more wistfulness in her performance, and by the end of it Dean thought he’d seen the sparkle of tears around her eyes, though she was still smiling and having a great time up there. They handed the mics back to the DJ and she gave Cas a hug, which turned into helping him navigate the steps to get him off the stage without faceplanting. Dean ended the video and immediately sent it to Sam.
“Together,” Dean whispered. “Let’s do it together.” He sat up and pulled Cas’s underwear off, tossing them across the room and narrowly missing the candles. He laid back down, lining up their erections, both hissing a gasp as they brushed together. “There’s so many things I wanna do to you, angel. Things I want you to do to me, but this time I just… I just wanna be able to kiss you, you know?” He cupped Cas’s cheek and kissed him, and with the other hand he began to stroke them both.
“I did and I believe that he did. Unfortunately, it seemed like we were finally getting close at last, on that last mission, just a bit too late. But I valued him very much. He was one of my favorite brothers.”
“Well I am better looking,” Dean said. “But seriously man, you shouldn’t be so down on yourself like this. We’ve all done some shitty things and some awesome things. Jack wouldn’t have let you through the gates upstairs if he didn’t think you were on the better side of it all.”
“If you’re not Gabriel, who are you?” She backed away and grabbed the throw blanket from the back of the sofa and tossed it over his body, trying very hard not to stare. He was terribly good looking, after all, it was hard not to at least sneak a peek.
“You’re doing awesome,” Dean said. “C’mere.” He pulled Cas up onto the seat and kissed him. “Sweetheart. You give good head, and I love you.”
Cas sighed and leaned into the touch. “I do believe that I’ll resume wearing my own clothes once I can, but rest assured, Dean - no matter what I’m wearing, I am yours.”
Dean, Cas, Claire, and Kaia all walked back toward the park, but as they got there Dean tugged Cas’s hand and steered him toward the road that ran along the west side of the park, which was filled with food trucks on either side. “I’m going to die if I don’t get some overpriced hipster junk food soon,” he said.
“I’ll send one of the guys to walk you over for a potty break,” she said. “But I think you’ll be out of here soon. Your o2 sat’s already improving, your pulse is going down.” She patted him on the shoulder and fixed the nasal cannula back on his face.
“Those long arms come in handy!” Gabriel noted. “Gracias.” His eyes were filled with mirth and joy as they met Sam’s. His fingers brushed Sam’s hand as he accepted the pieces of candy, and Sam found himself wanting to chase that feeling.
They all peered around the table. There, lying spread eagle, was Gabriel’s very unconscious, very naked form.
They went through the kitchen and down the basement stairs. At the bottom was a little alcove with the laundry machines, the water heater, and the furnace, and a slightly battered fridge, and the usual basement clutter of boxes and old junk shoved against one wall. On the other side was the set of stairs that led to a door to the back yard. And in the back wall was a door that opened into a tiny apartment. There was a wood paneled main room, with a small sofa and a clunky old TV on a table, and a kitchenette along one wall. There was a bedroom done in lighter wood paneling, the bed made up with orange floral sheets and a thick blanket with a wolf howling at the moon, and a tiny bathroom, just barely big enough for toilet, sink, and shower cubicle.
He slid the housecoat up higher on her hips, shoving the fabric out of his way, and brought his hand between them, between her legs. “Why are you wearing underwear?” he whined. “Dammit.”
“Yeah, well. You just. Whatever,” he said. He didn’t even know why he’d asked her that, and now he couldn’t shake the idea out of his head. Especially as he watched Cas walking, watched all the heads turn as he walked by. Not that he had any doubts that Cas was his, not that he needed to stake his claim with a stupid ceremony and stupid ring. Anyway, they’d have to completely upend the vows because “til death do us part” was in no way correct here.
“He said it was going to be grace, but it turned out that he didn’t have any left. I have to wonder if it was a total bait and switch all along. So there was the feather as a substitution, which of course was Castiel’s, not Gabriel’s. Some herbs and weird fruits - those he made me buy in bulk so I have a shitload left. And some blood.” She slid her sleeve up, displaying a large adhesive bandage on the inside of her forearm. “That part really sucked.”
“Don’t suppose you’d take pity on a short guy and let me watch the parade from your shoulders?” came from behind his left elbow. Sam turned toward him with a smile.
“Not as far as I know,” Dean said. “Unless he went and did something really dumb in his first five minutes of humanity.”
“Hello, Dean,” Cas said, smiling, his whole face one big sunny smile. His hand moved up to cover Dean’s. They shifted closer, and Dean’s other hand grasped his chin gently. And then Dean moved in that last breath and brought their lips together, a delicate press that quickly shifted into something hungrier as Cas met him halfway there.
“This ain’t risk free,” Dean said. “You know that, right? Things could still go wrong. You got lucky once. Magic always has a price.”
“I know,” Castiel said, a guilty look on his face. “Tomorrow. I’ll call tomorrow. I just got back from being dead and I have half a fuzzy naval left.” He picked up the drink and chugged most of it, and wiped away tears at the corners of his eyes.
Castiel set up his phone to display the pattern that he’d found earlier and began on the green wool.
Stephan went up next with some Eminem crap. Then a few other people from the crowd. Dean ordered beer number two and got Cas a water. “You gotta slow down babe, I’ll be carrying you home.”
Dean sighed. “Okay, okay. Um, so Cas, when people text emojis and stuff, when they want to text sexy stuff, they have to work with what’s there. So it became a thing that… because there’s an eggplant emoji, that just came to mean… you know…” Cas was still frowning and looking confused. “It’s a dick, Cas. Eggplant means dick.”
Since the Impala was as good as new, Dean offered to drive them. It was another new experience, one hand on the steering wheel, the other clasped Cas’s hand on the seat between them. He thought about finding a secluded spot to park and slipping into the back seat with Cas, sometime soon. Maybe once they were headed back toward home.
Sylvia hugged Cas. “Thank you so much. You are the best. I have no idea what I would have done without you.”
Castiel looked through the bins of yarn for a few moments before picking out a soft green yarn, and another of lighter cream speckled through with tiny bits of green and blue and purple.
“Well. I’ve recently realized that I do enjoy you filthy.” He winked as suggestively as he could manage.
“Um. Are there no other options? I’m not sure my boyfriend likes vegetables,” Cas said. The guy gave him a confused side eye and shook his head. “Dean, do you-”
“Oh, that’s good news. I was wondering… so, it’s Friday, and Friday nights I usually go to this bar… do you think you guys might like to come?”
“I suppose I thought that we’ll undress and kiss for a while and see what inspiration we get after that. Touch each other’s bodies in various ways. I hope that there will be a few orgasms at some point. And I’m keenly interested in cuddling afterward.”
“I marked you up good,” Dean said. He laughed, entirely too pleased with himself, and walked toward the house. Cas followed, rolling his eyes.
“He ain’t used to good old fashioned bar food,” Dean said, draping an arm over him. “Weird religious family, you know.”
“Get out!” Gabriel exclaimed in delight. “Well, then there is one thing we can- oh, but no, I guess that can’t really…. Ahhh, shit. I dunno, man.”
“It- the virus is very aggressive- there’s nothing to be done!” he wailed, conjuring up a few tears for good measure. “Dean-O, my friend! If only it was January 12th, we’d have a chance-”
Cas gave the wheel a little spin. It clicked merrily around and landed on a yellow wedge. Cas squinted at the words printed there. “Kick me?” he said, puzzled.
Well, I'm sorry that this took so long, but it's been a wild 48 hours, as I'm sure I don't have to tell you. It knocked me for a loop. Y yo a ti, Cas.
“There was, you just didn’t see her. I was afraid she was going to hose us down with the vegetable sprayer.”
“So guys, are we checking out the bar scene tonight?” Kaia asked. “Should be pretty lit, right?” She dabbed a final bit of polish on and capped off the bottle.
“Sure thing.” She showed him how to fill the plastic cup with batter, pour it in and start the cooking process. She leaned close enough that he could smell her perfume. He wasn’t sure if it would be rude to move further away. She patted his arm, her bracelets jingling and he was beginning to feel suspicious of her motives. “Anything else I can do for you?”
“They sold him out to a demon,” Castiel said softly. “We had no idea that he was even still alive all those years.”
“It says kazoo,” Dean said, collecting the prize from the befuddled woman and ushering them all out of her booth and away from the crowds.
a little poetic. Anyway, the point is, romantic love is extremely difficult. It is made even more so by not telling people things.”
“Yes,” Dean assured him. Cas’s fingers nudged deeper on every stroke. He tried to recall, the details fuzzy in this human brain but he was sure that he knew every cell of Dean’s body, and that if he could just reach another inch or so higher… ahh yes, there it was. Dean’s head shot up off the pillow and he cried out, “holy
“Now nothing can take you away from me. We’ve been down that road before. But that’s over now. You keep me coming back for more.” Never were truer words sung, Dean was sure. “Baby you’re all that I want, when you’re lying here in my arms, I’m finding it hard to believe, we’re in Heaven.” He hazarded a look at Cas. Cas was gazing at him with such open longing, and it hit him all at once that he’d been an idiot not to have ever seen it before.
They followed Sylvia into the dining room. Salad and garlic bread were already laid out, and the table was set. She’d been done with work for quite some time, it seemed. There was even wine on the table, and a cold six pack of beer still tucked in the plastic liquor store bag.
“Lots of free crap, too,” Dean said, gesturing with his backscratcher. “Still don’t have a bottle opener, though. Could have fixed the prize wheel for that instead of messing with Cas.”
“Ugh,” she groaned. “I’m glad I’m not working today. The last thing I need is to stare at a computer screen.” She poured coffee, dug around on the windowsill for the ibuprofen bottle, lost among the dead plants and the dusty happy meal toys. “How are you?”
“Need more beer in me before I try that again,” Dean proclaimed as they walked away, toward the back of the room where it was dark and less crowded. He put an arm around Cas’s shoulders and pressed a messy kiss to his cheek. Stumbling and awkward, he crowded Cas against the wall and kissed his neck. His fingertips slid up under Cas’s shirt, teasing at the skin of his stomach, and he sucked at the sweaty skin of Cas’s neck. “How about you and me hit the restroom, hmm?”
“Um, yes, I believe so. Hold on.” He held the phone out in front of him and tapped the screen until he got a camera icon, pointed the phone at the kitchen window, and snapped a lovely shot of the oak tree outside. He then sent it to Dean’s number. “Did that work?”
“Hey!” she said. “Hey! Are you okay?” The guy groaned a little, brought his hand up to cover his face, and rolled over onto his back with a pained whimper. “Gabriel?”
“You excited?” Dean murmured against his ear. They could hear the sounds of the parade as it approached, winding its way through the streets. Marching band renditions of pop songs filled the air.
“I can feel that,” Cas said. Their legs were slotted together and Cas rubbed his thigh against Dean’s hard cock. Dean groaned.
“You- you’re right about that,” she panted. Already her blood felt like fire, particularly where he kept grinding against her, she could feel the answering thrum of her pulse. “I need it. I need you, Gabriel. Fuck, sugar, that feels so good,”
Finally, on the last syllable, the bowl began to vibrate, nearly shaking itself off the coffee table. The light grew brighter and brighter, and Sylvia instinctively threw her arm up in front of her eyes and ducked behind the sofa. The room was filled with rumbling like thunder, and a high-pitched sound like radio feedback that gradually shifted into a thin, human scream.
“Do you want to bring your stuff in my room, Cas?” Dean asked, sensing his dilemma. “I mean, we already live together, we might as well live together. If you want. No pressure.”
“Do I get to meet him? Is that… is someone coming over? Is that why you’re making a nice dinner? Is it a hunter?” Dean could see the gears turning in Sam’s head, trying to think of every hunter they knew who was a dude.
The bathroom was tiled in light pink and beige, the chrome shiny, everything new and functional. It wasn’t huge or luxurious, but compared to what the Winchesters usually ended up in, it seemed that way. Cas peeked his head shyly in. “Are you certain that I won’t be in your way?”
They returned to the house and Castiel disappeared into the basement with his haul while she bustled around the kitchen, working on dinner. Bolognese sauce bubbled on the back of the stove and a spaghetti squash was roasting in the oven when Castiel reappeared, freshly showered and shaved and dressed.
Cas gave him the last few inches, bottoming out with a satisfied moan. He pulled back and thrust in again, carefully. Dean gasped. Cas stopped, but “keep going!” Dean hissed, and Cas did so. A few more thrusts and soon Dean was whimpering on each. “So good, Cas. You feel good in me,” he gasped out.
He looked up at her, never breaking his stride for a second. He worked her through it until her legs shook violently and she was gasping for air.
Cas stroked a hand across his cheek. “You do. You’ve certainly left me boneless and stunned silent quite a few times. Remember last week in the shower? I couldn’t stand up for ten minutes.”
“Look what he got me,” Dean grumbled, pointing with his knife toward the corner of the table. A coffee mug sat there. It was printed all over with the bisexual pride flag, and in white puffy letters it read “World’s Okayest Bisexual.”
Sylvia tucked her knitting project away in her bag and handed the television remote to Cas. “Good luck.”
“Please,” Dean whimpered. Cas smiled a wicked smile and brought his lips to Dean’s cock. Slowly, he teased his tongue around before sucking Dean into the heat of his mouth. He bobbed his head down and sucked him further in. Dean moaned and threaded his fingers gently through Cas’s hair. Cas looked up and caught Dean’s eyes as he moved up and down, seeking Dean’s pleasure.
“Dean!” Cas exclaimed, aghast. He dropped the shotgun and ran toward Dean. Cas whipped his coat off and wrapped it around Dean, smothering the flames.
This close to home, Dean was starting to feel anxious to get there already. It had been a week since he’d left home. A week ago, he’d been in an alcoholic daze, barely alive, trying to imagine how he could possibly go on. He swallowed hard and grasped for Cas’s hand on the seat between them. Cas seemed to somehow understand, and without a word, soothe his panic just by the stroke of his thumb against the back of Dean’s hand.
Finding shoes to wear to the store turned out to be a struggle. The only shoes of Sylvia’s that Castiel could just about stuff his feet into were battered old lime green crocs. Fortunately, Castiel didn’t seem to notice that he looked like a fashion disaster.
Dean hummed appreciatively and let Cas clean him up, then pull him into a tender embrace and stroke his hair softly. Dean was still shaking, even with Cas holding him and tucking the blankets around him. “Was it that intense?” Cas asked.
“Yeah. Yeah, um. I dunno if you’re drained enough to sleep or whatever, but I just don’t want you driving off when you’re not a hundred percent and… well, I…” He shook his head as Sam came out of the bathroom and picked up the car keys. “Drive careful you two. And be careful with my car, Sam.”
Sam’s mouth formed a perfect O, and Gabriel scrubbed his hand across his face. “Yeah, that’s what I thought,” Sylvia said acidly as she spun to leave again. Cas gave the pair a final glare as he sprinted off to follow Sylvia.
Dean had left the brew pub soon after Sam and Eileen had finished explaining things to him. He could tell that they were doing well on the making up part of the misunderstanding, but he’d just as soon get out of their way and let them finish. Hopefully Eileen would forgive Sam for sucking face with Gabriel, of all people, and they could move on with things. So maybe they weren’t ready to get married yet, big deal. Not everyone needed to charge ahead the way he and Cas were. Not that they were engaged yet either. Yet? Wait, was he really thinking about that?
“She didn’t see you for ten years and she didn’t move on, dude,” Dean scoffed. “Sounds to me like she’s attached.”
They piled into Sylvia’s little Toyota, Dean riding shotgun and Castiel stuffed into the tiny backseat. “Put some tunes on,” she commanded Dean. “Watch your knee,” she added as she shifted into reverse and backed out of the driveway, jamming the gearshift against his leg. “Sorry.”
Dean had been stupidly excited when he’d talked to Cas two days ago, so much so that he’d ended the call with a breathy “Can’t wait to see you, Cas.” That had earned a judgey side-eye from Sam. But Dean didn’t care. He was starting to become aware of just how much he missed Cas when they were apart.
“Well that looks fun,” Dean commented as a person zipped down the line on a harness. They started out on a tower sticking up from a huge truck trailer, and the line went out across the meadow and diagonally down, rapidly at first, but then slowing down as they approached ground level.
“C’mon,” Sylvia said, standing up. She led him toward the kitchen and gestured toward the table, indicating that he should sit down, while she washed her hands. “Any requests?”
“Well I’m here now.” He tilted his head and gave her a little pout. She melted and pulled him into a big, teary hug that soon shifted into a kiss. His hands stroked her face and her hair, and then Dean was clearing his throat and they pulled apart again.
“Mostly, yeah. I was so mad! I didn’t think that he could ever die, and I was certain that nothing in the universe was as powerful as him. So what else could have happened?” She shook her head. “And now you tell me it was another angel. And that not only that, but a demon overpowered him!”
And then they were out in the sunny meadow again, and Sam’s face was there too, peering down at him. “I’ve healed the worst of it, but he’s still very bad off,” Cas was saying, the vibration of his voice rumbling through Dean’s body. “We should take him for medical treatment. I don’t think I can-”
“That’s what it’s about, but of course supportive people who are straight can go too. I’d like to go. It’s just a… a nice experience. I’d like to feel a part of that idea that the world is… becoming kinder.” Sam watched Dean’s face as he spoke, but Dean just continued chewing angrily and staring off into the distance.
Dean was surprised to see that one corner of the park, near the playground equipment, contained bouncy castles, and church groups’ tents with kids’ games and crafts. “There’s
As the day wore on, Castiel grew increasingly nervous. Sylvia had put daytime soaps on the TV and was curled up on the couch knitting, but she couldn’t even concentrate on that with Castiel’s nervous energy. He had put aside his own project, hands too shaky to make the needles work, and was holding a book, turning back and forth the same two pages, and glancing at his phone.
“I still can’t wrap my head around never seeing him again.” She started pushing the cart down the aisle. “Don’t worry about me, I just have to get through it I guess. C’mon, let’s get you a burner phone while we’re here.”
“Oh no. I ain’t getting involved in any brotherly crap, because then it’s fair game for him to get between me ‘n Sam. And I’m not about to lose my big brother privileges.”
“Oh come on babe, get me a bottle opener,” Dean said. He picked up one of the pamphlets to read about what they were selling here. Life insurance. Very cheerful.
They stopped in a grocery store in West Virginia for snacks, and Dean filled a basket with chips and beef jerky and sodas while Cas went off in search of a veggie tray. Dean found him there pondering the merits of carrot sticks and chopped broccoli, and he looked so adorable that Dean backed him into the side of the cooler and kissed him thoroughly.
Dean frowned into his beer. “I dunno, Cas. I guess if you’re going, I should go too. I mean, what if some guy tries hitting on you, huh?”
Cas and Sylvia were in the back of a dimly lit bar, at a small table tucked between a jukebox and a payphone. The place had wood paneled walls with the smell of decades of cigarette smoke and sour beer soaked into them, and a linoleum floor with a stickiness that no amount of pine-sol could hope to scrub away.
“Okay.” Dean kissed him. “Okay, I’ve got… gotta get stuff from my bag.” He pulled away, went over to his duffel bag and returned with a purple bottle and a strip of condoms in his hands. He sat down and looked at them, licked his lips nervously. “This is… new territory for me.”
“No, I’m fine. I’ll just sit here.” He patted the curved arms of the chair. “I suppose Dean won’t object to me watching over him, given the circumstances.”
“I’m so sorry I put you through that, man,” Dean said. They exchanged a gentle smile. “Thing is, I was tr- oh. Oh boy.” He laid his hand against his stomach, trying to calm it. With his other hand, he yanked the oxygen tube off his nose. “Gotta get that nurse back here.”
They lingered over dinner for a long time, stuffing themselves slowly, drinking and laughing over empty plates, then again with the pies and coffee and more drinks.
It was crazy, Dean thought as the cold seeped through his body, that the kid had to go and end up in life threatening danger again after the freaking hunt was over and the monsters were dead. Lucky that Dean had been down near the car looking for another axe when the kid had lost her footing on the wet, muddy slope and ended up in the water. Damn lucky.
Keeping the radio off was essential to preserving what little juice the battery had, so Dean found himself singing and humming an odd medley of whatever lyrics popped into his mind at the moment. The drive seemed to take forever this way. He remembered the last radio-free drive, Cas by his side, keeping him company. Somehow they never ran out of stuff to talk about.
“You were dead,” Castiel said. “Some time has gone by. We were only just able to bring you back. You may wish for some clothes. It can get cold being human.” He handed Gabriel a bundle of green fleece, the first piece of clothing he’d been able to grab.
“Sam is so annoying,” Dean said as Cas walked into the kitchen. Dean had been in there alone, chopping onions as bacon sizzled in the frying pan behind him.
“OW! Dammit, Gabriel!” Cas shouted, spinning around and scowling at his brother who was peeking around the tent wall and grinning. “You really suck.”
“Well, as much as I’d like to see Cas get flung to the mat in like half a second, I think Kaia and I are gonna catch a Lyft back to the motel. See ya tomorrow.” Claire draped an arm around Kaia’s waist.
He had stripped from the waist up and thrown everything over a tree branch and was struggling out of his soaked jeans when Cas pulled up in his pickup truck. It was stupid, but Dean felt suddenly self-conscious that he was standing there with his soaking wet gray boxer briefs pasted to his skin, and he quickly pulled on his dry jeans. By the time Cas got out of the truck and walked over to him, he’d finished dressing, at least with what he had available. He sat on the back seat, socked feet propped up on the doorway, as Cas approached.
“You’re cured! Hallelujah!” Gabriel exclaimed. “Uh, Cassie, I… I think you can let him go now.” But Cas didn’t, not really. He ended the kiss, but their lips were only a breath apart, and now they were whispering to each other.
“You look amazing,” Dean said drowsily, drinking in the delicious sight. “Is that… are you wearing makeup?”
“That was pretty awesome,” Dean said as he pulled out of the parking lot. “Did you have a good time?” He caught her eyes in the rearview mirror.
“You would have gotten through,” Cas said confidently. “Still, I’m glad to have helped.” He beamed as she kissed his cheek.
“What happened?” Sam asked from the front seat. “I don’t understand. He was over there for maybe ten minutes. I thought he went to make a phone call and then I thought maybe he was taking a leak in the woods or something, and then you showed up.”
They laid side by side and traded kisses. Dean slipped his hand into Cas’s boxers and closed his hand around his cock and stroked slowly. Castiel gripped Dean and tried to match his rhythm.
Dean was used to getting up early after rough nights, and this was hardly the roughest one on record for him. He woke up and stretched, and looked at the sleeping angel by his side, hogging the blankets, his dark hair a disastrous tangle on the pillow. Cas stirred a little when he leaned over to kiss his temple, but he was much less enthusiastic about the awakening process.
Cas leaned his weight on his hands and gazed at Dean’s face in the candlelight. He was looking up at Cas with suche awe, and Cas felt the full measure of his love wash over him. Cas captured his lips in a kiss and shifted his weight slightly, relishing the feel of their bare stomachs and chests brushing together, but the movement pressed their erections together with even more urgency.
“Gabriel!” Sylvia exclaimed, crawling over toward him. She touched his chest, felt the rise and fall. “He’s alive. He’s alive. Gabriel, wake up!” she shook his shoulder and tapped his cheeks. “C’mon sugar, wake up.”
Dean gave a smug look and strolled up to Cas and slung an arm around his waist. “We slept just fine,” he said. “Didn’t we, sweetheart?”
“Dean, that was... splendid, amazing, awesome, I can’t think of the words for it,” Cas said. “Am I supposed to be shaking like this?”
The trunk lid was open, as was the passenger door. Cas was sitting on the seat clad in pajamas, his bare feet on the ground. He was looking into a paper bag.
And then Dean spotted him. Lying on the floor, ten yards or so in front of him, just visible through the thinning clouds. A crumpled figure in rags. Bare feet, tattered slacks, a once-white dress shirt gone grubby and stained with blood. And tousled, dark hair. He was face down in the dirt of the old barn, in the spot where he’d once stood proud and unafraid and let Dean stab him through the heart.
“We’re pretty chill.” She poured herself a cup of coffee and splashed creamer into it. “How’s Dean?”
“No! Sam, oh my god, no! Listen. Fuck. I’m really fucking this up.” Dean put down the garlic knot that he’d just mangled and wiped his hands on the dish towel. “I don’t mean normal like… not abnormal… shit. But like it’s a default, like when you meet someone you assume they’re straight unless you get told otherwise, right?”
Cas sighed wistfully. -You look exquisite- he replied. Then after a moment he added. -It’s nice to be able to tell you that. I always think it-
“Uhh.. sorry,” she said. “I know it’s a disaster. This one’s the yarn over here.” She led him to a wire rack full of soft-sided cubes. Each little bin was stuffed with yarn. “Um, the ones on the top are things that I have set aside for something, but the rest are just… waiting for inspiration. So feel free.”
“You look good, too,” she said, staring hungrily. They kissed again, hands wandering everywhere. Sylvia started walking them toward the couch, but Gabriel grabbed her hips and stopped her.
Several minutes later, they walked out toward the barn to assist Sam and Jack, Dean feeling odd and awkward in the pristine Nike sneakers and Cas’s coat flapping around his legs. “Hopefully the werewolf bonfire will warm me up soon, and then you can have your coat back,” Dean said.
“They have so much variety at the food trucks though,” said Sylvia. “I’ve gotta find keto bombs, or maybe a smoothie or something. But I’m sure Dean would not enjoy that.”
Cas cupped his hands around the curve of Dean’s ass. “I think… I think I know what you are saying. And yes I would like...”
He slid his thumb under her chin and tilted it up, meeting her eyes. “I love you too,” he said. “And I don’t want to lose you. I’ve been stupid, so stupid, Syl.”
They ended up at a Thai restaurant, then back at Sylvia’s hotel room afterwards. Gabriel sat on the bed and plumped the pillows and examined the contents of the nightstand while Sylvia went into the bathroom and made herself comfortable for the evening. She brushed her teeth, took off her makeup, switched her contacts for glasses, and pulled on a boring pink cotton sleep shirt.
There is no plot whatsoever. You could skip this if you really don't want the details of what Cas and Dean get up to alone at night.
Claire stood up and stretched. “Meh, I guess for a couple of old dudes you’ve both done alright. You really deserve each other. Anyway, we’re gonna go take a nap before the festivities. When are we heading out?”
After they finished lunch, Sylvia dug in the pantry and produced a can of cherry pie filling and some baking chocolate. So they made a lattice-top cherry pie. Castiel learned how to mix the pie dough without letting it get too tough, to roll it out and flip it from the mat into the dish, and to meticulously cut and weave the top crust. They made another shell and baked it empty, filled with lentils for weight, and mixed up French silk filling.
“When have I ever let you starve?” Dean said tiredly. “Make yourself useful, chop up that cucumber. Watch for the bad spots, it’s been in the fridge a while.”
“Hey Cas, you’ll love this. There’s a beehive in an old tree.” Dean grinned. There didn’t seem to be any bees around, they were probably all out doing important bee stuff, and maybe he could get a nice big chunk of honeycomb for Cas. He’d like that.
Dean lifted his head and looked into his eyes. “I love you, too, Cas.” They looked into each other’s eyes, each so full of love, and Dean realized that they always had been, this had always been in their eyes, it was just out loud now.
His hand really wasn’t big enough, and Cas closed his hands around them as well. “That’s it, sweetheart,” Dean murmured between kisses. “Makin’ me feel so good, Cas.”
Dean had the broom and dustpan and was sweeping up the broken glass in the living room. Castiel was putting a casserole dish on the dining table. The napkin holder and the salt and pepper shakers had been picked up and placed on a side table, even the vase of carnations, though they looked a little worse for the wear. The tablecloth was still twisted sideways and decidedly wrinkled. Castiel had just smoothed it out a little and then set the table. Sylvia covered her mouth and faked a yawn to hide her mortified face.
Dean and Cas stood by, ready in case there was any unforeseen trouble. Sylvia knelt on the floor in front of the table and sliced her arm, dripping the bright red blood into the bowl. When that was finished, Cas helped her press a bandage to the wound, Dean began to crumble the various ingredients into the bowl.
They headed back out soon afterward. It was just after dark when they crossed the Mississippi, and Dean stopped soon afterwards. They opted for drive-through burgers eaten in the motel room, sprawled out on the bed watching late night talk shows before crawling under the covers and falling asleep. This time Dean wiggled himself into little spoon position, and Cas slept soundly with his arms full of Dean.
“Sorry we don’t have PB&J,” Sam apologized. “But there are three burritos, some beef chow mein, and half a ham and cheese sub in the fridge.”
The next thing Dean knew, the girl at the bottom of the ride was helping him to his feet and getting the harness off of him. He managed to make it a few yards away on rubbery legs before he sat down in the grass and took inventory of his limbs.
Cas took a deep breath in and let out a low moan. His face crinkled up with pain. “Whhh?” he wheezed out, and his hands came up towards his face to shield himself.
The restroom was tiled in shades of beige and brown with white accents. It was spacious and bright, and remarkably clean. A row of five sinks lined the nearest wall, with large mirrors above and between them. Four urinals ran along the back wall, and then the stalls were to the right of those. The stall enclosures were sturdy, and covered from just above the floor to well above head height, affording much more privacy than the average restroom, and as Cas soon found out when Dean shoved him into an empty one, they were quite large inside as well, easily twice as large as the average bathroom stall.
“At the moment I’m in suburban New Jersey watching bird feeders. But Dean should be here to pick me up, perhaps tomorrow. Then we’ll see from there.”
“I miss him every day,” Cas said sadly. “It’s a comfort to hear good news about him, but I think I’m always going to miss his presence in my life.” Dean leaned over and squeezed Cas’s shoulder, and Cas’s hand reached up to hold Dean’s.
“Um, yeah,” Sam scoffed. “Kids have families with LGBT members, or they might be thinking about their own identities themselves. Or even some straight families just don’t want their kids to grow up ignorant.”
“Damn skippy she does!” Gabriel returned, a flash of anger in his eyes. “That’s the whole point, bucko.”
“Heh. Well, it took until years later, looking back and piecing things together, to really see what you were trying to do. Obviously I wish you could have just found a way to tell us and, you know, we really could have changed everything before it started - but I was glad that you cared. I just didn’t think you cared about me, not like that anyway.” And then, before he could think about it too hard, he leaned over and grabbed Gabriel by the shoulders and kissed him. Gabe’s lips were delicious and soft and it would have been so easy to stay like that all day, and then as quickly as he’d started, Sam pulled away.
They laid together in a comfortable tangle post-cleanup, still shaking. Dean laid his head against Cas’s shoulder and Cas stroked his fingers through Dean’s hair and smoothed his hands down his back. Neither spoke; the moment felt too raw for words.
“Go for it, Cas,” Dean wheedled. “I know you can get it all the way up.” Sam glared at Dean, his cheeks flaming red. Dean grinned and reached out to rub Cas’s bicep.
Dean knocked on the door, then wiped his palms on his pants. All the times he’d knocked on doors in all kinds of nerve-wracking situations and here he was getting sweaty palms over Cas? C’mon, it’s just Cas, he told himself. Just-
Gabriel looked as if he’d had a bucket of ice water to the head. “Yeah?” he managed, though he sounded choked.
“Ehhh. Oh well.” He sighed. “I have such a crush on that kid. I gotta show you a pic, Syl. He’s like twelve feet tall.”
Claire shook her head sadly. “Straight guys could never. You pulled him out of Hell and Alex can’t even get a guy to buy her tampons without whining.”
Castiel was already up, and from the looks of things, he was not terribly susceptible to hangovers in spite of his new humanity. Coffee was gurgling away in the pot, and he was peering in the fridge, frowning.
“Cas, I’ve been meaning to tell you… god, this is so stupid of me, I’m really going to regret this in the morning.. Um. Shit. It’s just. I… I’ve been thinking… you’re probably going to think I’m… look, I know it’s just a weird human thing and hopefully you won’t, uh, not want to hang around with me anymore. But um. I was going to tell you. If the whole wasp thing hadn’t happened, I was trying to get you a big ol’ chunk of honey as a gift because I wanted to tell you… well, I guess I’m kinda sweet on you.”
“No, not at all,” Cas laughed. “I think I may tempt him with chocolate covered cheesecake on a stick.”
Cas was silent for a moment, thoughtful, just long enough to make Dean nervous. “I think you’re looking at it sideways, Dean. Your love- what we have together- is beneficial to me in getting through the ‘crap’ that I have to deal with. I don’t want to say that I would not have managed somehow if you hadn’t wanted me. I’ve done so before.” At Dean’s stricken face, he hurriedly added, “I feel like we’ve been tiptoeing around that- but still, it is true; it happened and I was alright-”
“Dinner and a show,” Cas remarked. He was carefully laying out his prizes from the day on the dresser.
“Oh? You make any huge-ass cakes with robotics and stuff? I saw one last week that was a dragon and they rigged up a thing inside it to turn the head and shoot fire.”
“I’ll forgive you for that if you’ll forgive me for being cowardly,” Sam said. He sat up straight and reached for Gabriel’s hand, twining their fingers together. “I’d like to suggest more kissing, and no more mean pranks. Deal?”
“Well as you said, there’s no rush. And I find that the snacks from earlier seem to have worn off already.” Cas patted his grumbling stomach ruefully.
“Oh for- really? Is everyone going to grill me about Sylvia today?” he groaned. “That’s… it’s not good for her. She could be perfectly normal if I leave her alone. Surely you understand that.”
Sylvia popped the lid off the grace container and shook the precious drops into the disgusting mixture in the bowl. Then she dropped in the feathers and began to recite the incantation.
“I believe she loved him more than she’s been saying,” Castiel said. Dean stared into his beer with a frown. “What are you thinking about, Dean?”
Dean pulled up to the address that Cas had texted him. An unimpressive white house with a green roof, just a simple little thing. The front yard had a stepping stone pathway that ran crookedly between shrubberies and gravel, from the sidewalk up to the door. A mailbox on a post stood near the sidewalk, bearing a decal of llamas wearing sunglasses. On the stoop next to the front door was a ceramic statue of a fat green frog wearing overalls and playing a banjo, and a welcome mat proclaimed “The Neighbors Have Better Stuff.”
Cas handed over his armful of prizes to Sam, paid the cash, and took up the hammer. “One swing, make it count,” the guy said.
Sam met them at the room door and he scooped Cas into a hug. There were tears in the corners of his eyes when he pulled away.
“Eileen?” he said incredulously. “What are you doing here?” Dean was standing behind her, looking somewhere between pissed off and amused.
Cas was stabbing viciously with his straw at the lemon in his glass of water. “Are you going to sing me a nice song?” he asked. He was only a little tipsy now, though Dean wasn’t sure if he was going to make it to the car completely unassisted.
Sam brought the plate over and handed it to Cas, who began eating eagerly. “So, um. While I was waiting here, I talked to Eileen. She’d actually like some help with the case in Tennessee.” He cleared his throat and looked back and forth from Cas to Dean. “I was thinking about leaving now, actually. I could get there tomorrow.”
Sam winced. “It is easier, or at least I thought it would be, to fall for someone who’s been in this life somehow and really gets it. Then again, I don’t know how much that applies to you. There’s no one else like you.”
Sam’s driving was enough to set his teeth on edge on a good day, but a panicked Sam driving while Dean was already feeling like shit was just awful. Only the feeling of Cas’s fingers slowly carding through his hair, and stroking down his arm was keeping him together. In this moment he knew that Cas wouldn’t let anything happen to him, that he was safe here with Cas holding him, and he almost wanted to cry from that feeling.
Dean tugged him close by the lapels of his coat and kissed him. “I’m yours too, angel,” he murmured. “Now let’s go home.”
“Ah. I see. And I guess by the current state of affairs you’re not exactly booking your tux rental right now?”
Gabriel let out a slow, deep sigh. Sylvia reached over and squeezed his shoulder. “Do you think the kid might be okay with things if I… pop in for a visit? See if he needs a hand? Haven’t seen the old homestead in a hot minute.”
Dean was rolling dough and shaping it into garlic knots when Sam came into the kitchen. The big pot was nearly to a boil on the back of the stove, waiting for spaghetti noodles. One of the mixing bowls held a blob of pesto, jarred stuff that Dean had doctored up a little, waiting for hot noodles to mix in. A big bowl of lettuce was on the counter, with cucumber and tomato and onion nearby, and a measuring cup full of freshly made dressing, all waiting to be tossed together.
“Yep, karaoke night at Jill’s Grill. Two dollar drafts, nacho specials, and the radio station is there with a prize wheel once a month. I got a bottle opener last week.” She shrugged. “You don’t have to sing, but it’s fun. No one cares if you sound good.”
He stood up as Cas got back to the table and gave him a kiss. Maybe a little too showy, but he needed the whole bar to know exactly whose guy Cas was.
“Thanks, but… you know, wings. I’m set. Have a good night, guys.” He gave a little wave and walked off into the night before disappearing.
“He did,” Sylvia said. “He saved me. But… he was careless. I saw his wings, heard his true voice. I needed answers. We were already- entangled, I guess you could say, by then. And he told me everything.”
The car repair was finished and the Impala was purring like her old self. Castiel helped Dean wipe down and pack up tools and tuck things away in the trunk. He was pushing the toolbox in to make room to stash the old alternator when he dislodged a crinkly paper lunch bag. He plucked at it curiously. “You didn’t leave an old sandwich in here, did you?” he asked Dean, who was just coming over with the drain pan.
As Dean slid back into his seat after the song, Cas squeezed his hand. “Now who’s the romantic sap?” Cas murmured.
Sam looked miserable, and Cas was about to ask him if he was feeling alright when the emcee came out and the show began.
“I just don’t understand,” Sylvia said. “You invited me and then, what, you changed your mind? But why did you lie?”
“Seriously?” she exclaimed. “Are you seriously telling me that I just summoned you back from the dead?”
Dean and Cas were sitting in a booth, beers and baskets of burgers and fries on the table in front of them. On the other side of the divider, the stools at the bar were nearly all filled. Dean was gazing out the window toward the parking lot, watching people pulling up to the to-go parking spaces, coming in the nearby door and fetching their bags of food from the counter behind him. The sleeves of his purple flannel were rolled up to his elbows, and he was stuffing fries into his mouth.
“I haven’t discussed my orientation, anything of the sort with anyone,” Cas said. “I have no objection to anyone knowing, I just never felt the need before. It never mattered. At least, I thought so. I thought that since you were the only one I wanted and I could never have you, that it was irrelevant.” He paused. “But I was wrong. I believe I have a lot more thinking to do about that.” He dug a spoonful of ice cream, thick with rainbow sprinkles, and ate it. “What about you, Dean? Have you ever told anyone?”
If you have not yet heard Jensen Ackles sing "Heaven" then get you to youtube and have a religious experience. I'm not even particularly a Jensen girl but like damn.
“Surprise,” she said, beaming brightly. There was a hint of nervousness and uncertainty in her eyes.
“I didn’t say that,” Cas said. And the next thing Dean knew, Cas had spun them around and now Dean was being pinned against the wall and Cas was grinding against him. One hand splayed out on Dean’s throat as he kissed him, a dirty, demanding kiss. He seized Dean’s hand and pulled it against his crotch, fumbling at his fly, demanding Dean’s fingers there. Oh, so he wanted to play it like this? Well, Dean was certainly game. As Cas finally freed his cock and wrapped Dean’s fingers around it, Dean whimpered. Oh yes, he liked this.
“Sunset was 23 minutes ago,” Cas said. They walked along through the woods, crunching over the dead leaves and branches on the ground. They’d had to hike out to check on an abandoned shack that may have been the monster’s hideout. Turned out to be a dead end after all, and a waste of effort. Now they were headed back to where the car was parked at the trailhead, though they still had another mile or two to go.
“You have that effect on m--mmmm, yes!” His fingers had slid easily to her clit and he was teasing it with delicate strokes. He sucked a bruise into the skin at the top of her hipbone and brought his other hand down to spread her open and slide fingers deep inside, achingly slowly. Sylvia whimpered. His fingers worked her over with delicate precision. But all too soon he was stopping, pulling them free. She made a disappointed noise.
“I get what you’re saying,” Dean conceded. “And I’m not suggesting that I should leave you to fend for yourself - you know I would never have if I didn’t have to. But sweetheart, what am saying is, are we doing all this too fast?”
dumb. But I finally let Cas talk sense into me. And maybe you don’t need to be a dumbass about this.”
Sam went to the kitchenette and began fixing him a plate with a little of everything. Dean sat on the opposite bed and watched him quietly. “You’re here, you’re really here,” he murmured, low enough that Sam couldn’t hear him. “Drinking a beer, wrapped in my coat - looks great on you, by the way,” Dean added, blushing. Cas gave him a bashful smile, and then they couldn't seem to stop staring at each other.
Sam leaned down and kissed her. Her taste, her scent, almost as familiar as his own, and he wanted to burst with the joy at having her back in his arms again. And yet, at the same time, he thought about the morning’s kisses, and how they were also breathtakingly amazing and how he wanted to do that again too, and then the guilt set in. Sam pulled away.
-See you soon- Cas replied. He picked up his tea and sipped it and tried to follow the plot of the soap opera.
Dean stood in the bedroom, in front of his mirror. His hair remained the same short style as always, only now it was a brilliant, flaming red. Perhaps a shade or two brighter than Rowena’s, a natural red still but a very startling color. It didn’t look half bad on him, Gabriel mused. Maybe he’d done the guy a favor.
“Dean,” he murmured. Cas slid a hand underneath his shoulders and propped him up, and suddenly he felt the warm pulse of grace running through him, and the trickle of air he’d been breathing suddenly became larger. The awful swelling in his throat subsided, and he gasped in desperate breaths. Cas’s other arm slid underneath his knees, and he was lifted, held against Cas’s body and Cas carried him away from the hive. His cheek was pressed against the lapel of Cas’s coat and he could feel the warmth of Cas through it, and hear his heartbeat.
“Oh, you know. Just decided to go for a swim in a freezing pond in all my clothes,” Dean said. “Don’t suppose you have dry shoes or a coat stuffed in that thing somewhere?” he asked, gesturing at Cas’s truck. A chilly breeze ruffled Cas’s hair adorably, and made his coat billow out behind him. Dean shivered. “I’m frigging cold.”
“It’s a headband,” he said, tilting his phone so that she could see the pattern. “I liked the cable knit design particularly.”
“Cas, no, it’s fine, it’s great,” Dean said, snatching it from his hands as he steered him away from the game. “I’m… real happy with the eggplant, okay?”
“You’re a terrible priest,” Cas said bluntly. “Well perhaps you ought to go hide in the men’s room.”
“Cas,” Dean sighed. He stroked his thumb across Cas’s cheek and stared into those blue, blue eyes. “Man, the sky’s gotta be so jealous,” he said, before realizing that he’d said it out loud. Cas was looking at him in confusion, and Dean blushed as he realized he was going to have to clarify his dumb little thought. “Your eyes… the sky’s gotta wish it was that blue. Cause they’re so much prettier.”
“No I didn’t,” Dean replied indignantly. He scrubbed his hand across his face. “Hey, did you guys try the water gun shooting the clown thing yet?”
“You’re lucky your friends got you here as fast as they did,” said the nurse. “I haven’t seen this severe of a reaction in a very long time.” She wrote something on his chart, then looked at her watch. “So, we’re going to let this drip for a while then recheck some things. Doc is hopeful that we’ll be able to get you well on your way to recovery and send you home in a few hours with some meds. Alright? Call button’s there if you need anything. And I mean anything. Don’t let him up without assistance,” she said, fixing Sam and then Cas with a firm glare. And with that, she swooshed through the curtain.
Dean had stopped at a truck stop just across the Delaware River. He was too nervous to eat anything, but he brushed his teeth and combed his hair in the bathroom, peering critically at himself in the spotty mirror. Too many bags under his eyes, too many wrinkles, gray hair popping all along his temples, going soft and pudgy in the gut. What did he have to offer a guy like Cas? And that was just the surface stuff.
“What the hell?” Dean said, turning around and glancing over the top of the pamphlet to read the wheel. “Do you need glasses, Cas? It says-”
“Yeah, that’s what Sam said. Guess my brother is kind of God now, which is  too weird for words. I’m probably never winning at arm wrestling or Uno or, like, anything against him ever again.”
“I can’t! I can’t call him; I told him I loved him! You can’t just… It’s my understanding that that sort of thing ruins friendships. Makes them uncomfortable.”
Cas snuggled against Dean’s side, with Dean’s arm around his shoulders, and listened to Dean tell him all the details of the events since his death. “I didn’t know what I was going to do with myself anymore, until you called me,” Dean said. “I never know how to keep going without you. But this time I wanted to at least try to be who you think I am.”
“I see. Well I guess there’s only one thing left to do,” Sam sighed. He twisted around to face Gabriel, leaning in close, planting his hands on the table on either side of where he sat. Gabriel started to open his mouth to ask Sam what exactly that would be, when Sam’s mouth was suddenly on his. Okay, this was definitely a good development. Sam’s lips were soft and hot, and his tongue - oh, hello! - oh, damn, so nice. Why hadn’t he realized before how badly he needed to know how Sam’s mouth tasted? Well, he might be slow on the uptake, but he could catch up quickly. He soon had one hand in Sam’s hair, the other resting on his side, brushing lightly over his ribs. Sam’s breathing quickened, and he had to break the kiss off to gasp for air.
Claire eyed him up and down. “Not like…” She made a flapping motion with her arms. “Not ‘fear not I bring you glad tidings’ and golden myrrh and all that crap?”
Sylvia logged off her work module and stood up and stretched. It was mid afternoon and she’d completed all the tasks that were absolutely essential today. She kept expecting Castiel to pop in and she’d honestly gotten a little worried as the hours dragged on and he didn’t.
“Sam,” she said sadly, reaching up to brush the tears that had leaked down his cheeks. “Some things are different, but I’m still the same. I don’t want to stop dating you, but it can’t be… it can’t be like that. Maybe in a few years.”
Cas texted Sam -We’ll be home in about five hours. Are you there?- Then he sent a message to Sylvia: -We’re arriving home today. The trip has been lovely. How are you? How’s Gabriel?- And one for Claire: -Hey, are you still in the wilderness? LMK if you’re okay- *winky face**bear**tree* And then as an afterthought he added -Are s’mores good? I need to try them sometime-
“More often than not,” he agreed. “But whatever you did must have brought me here without my grace.”
Sam made an undignified snort. “No, he wasn’t terribly interested in the show, so he’s off enjoying the rest of the festival,” Cas said. “You should come with me after the show and hang out with us. I think we’ll probably grab some dessert at the food trucks.”
“And that is our cue to leave,” Dean said urgently, bolting from the room. “Cas, c’mon! I’ve already seen this movie, and I do not need the sequel.” Castiel followed him down the basement stairs a moment later.
“I like the way you think,” Gabriel said, stepping closer to him. “But I’m keeping it real today. For now, anyway. How’s it going, kiddo? Walk with me?”
By the time Dean had coffee ready, Cas had made his way up the stairs. His hair was still an adorable disaster, but his eyes were open and he was dressed. He dropped his backpack on the floor by the table and came up behind Dean and leaned on his shoulder, wrapping his arms around him.
“Yeah. Yeah, it’s… so far, so good, Cas. A little weird, but… I know it’s gonna be weird before it gets good.” He hissed as Cas’s finger pressed in, just the slightest bit.
“Well I’d like to,” Dean said. “C’mon man, seriously. All the crap we’ve been through our whole lives and you can’t talk to me about things?”
He sipped from a coffee mug - half coffee, half whiskey. The mug was pale yellow with little bees printed on it. Cas’s mug. He hadn’t looked when he’d grabbed it. Shit, he’d grabbed Cas’s mug. What would Cas-
“You don’t usually complain,” Cas replied coolly. He stood and began cleaning up the food wrappers and tidying up with a brusque, pointed silence. He then went into the bathroom, not quite slamming the door.
Cas let himself be pushed back onto the bed as Dean continued to stroke and tease him. Up around his hips, over the taut muscles of his stomach, then back to the task of removing his clothing. Dean lifted each leg as he pulled it free from the shorts and kissed from calf to knee.
Dean had ignored the wobby plastic furniture in favor of lugging one of the heavy wooden chairs out of the motel room, and was seated in that, which had the added benefit of being large and comfortable enough for Cas to perch on his lap. Cas was looking adorable in a soft gray polo and faded jeans, and his hands were busy with a complicated knitting project that required multiple sharp pointy bits sticking out all around it. Dean watched his hands hypnotically. He had no idea what this monstrosity was going to be, but it looked deadly. Like a terrifying pink wooly porcupine.
“It’s not like that! We all just came for a night out, I’m straight, it’s not… I’m not here for a hookup, jeez.”
“I have literally never felt better in my life.” He gave Cas an absolutely syrupy look. Sylvia gulped down the pills.
“Shit. Okay, um. I dunno what the number was but I remember that there were trees. Skinny trees on either side. Maybe the mailbox was shaped like a tractor?” As Dean described the entrance to the farm as best he could, he paced around the little grove of trees. One tree was dead and hollowed out, and as he got closer he could see that honey dripped down the side of it. Maybe this is where that bee had gone.
Ten years since she’d seen Gabriel’s face last. She’d prayed to him often, and never thought that he might not be out there to hear her. It was hard to know how Gabriel had ever felt - they certainly weren’t some exclusive, committed couple - but she had never stopped loving him, hoping that she’d at least see him again. Sylvia frantically snatched at the tissue box with shaking hands as she started sobbing uncontrollably.
When she came back out, he had pulled the covers back and had summoned up a pair of red striped pajamas that should have been hilarious but actually looked perfect on him. They crawled under the covers and cuddled and talked well into the night, until Sylvia dozed off in the middle of a sentence about the merits of the deconstruction of oreos before eating them. Gabriel chuckled, kissed her forehead, and let himself indulge in some sleep as well.
“There’s a big difference between me respecting your freedom and you just never fucking seeing me again!” she exclaimed. She dragged the back of her hand across the tears blurring her vision. “I love you, Gabe.”
Cas carefully pulled his t-shirt down and the covers back up, not a moment too soon as Sam emerged from the bathroom. Dean closed his eyes and pretended to be asleep.
“Do you want me to fuck you?” Cas murmured against his throat. He followed up this question with a sucking kiss to the delicate skin there.
The Blue Moon was absolutely the place to be on this, their busiest Friday night of the year. Dean parked the Impala in the gravel parking lot across the street; already the music was loud enough to be heard clearly as he stepped out of the car, and people crowded the wide front porch and the second floor patio. It was mostly a twenty-something crowd, and among that it was mostly men, much as it had been some sixteen years ago when Dean had last visited.
“That’s the chick from the interview this morning. If she sees me in here like this, she’s gonna realize I’m not a priest.”
There was a large range of performers, from older drag queens who’d clearly been at their craft for a long time and oozed finesse and polish, with perfectly executed, glamorous performances, to young and sexy newcomers with routines very nearly too hot for a daytime all-ages show, a few of which left Cas feeling squirmy and uncomfortable and wondering if perhaps Dean was right not to want him to come to this.
Cas leaned back and grasped Dean’s ass cheeks in both hands, pulling him up, steering him into a different angle and plunging into him again. If he had calculated correctly, this angle would be just right to-
Sam considered for a moment. “I don’t know, man. I don’t know her at all, really just what Cas has told me. She seemed kinda cold when Cas introduced us. I don’t think she likes me.”
“I was going to try to prepare you breakfast, as a thank you for your kindness,” he said as she walked in.
“I do enjoy the botanical gardens, but I’ve been there seventeen times now. It’s nice to do something different.”
“Me too, babe. I… I’m no good with the words, Cas. I just need to be with you. Damn, I wish you weren’t so far away!”
Dean pulled back. “I should get in the shower. Too bad it’s only big enough for one.” He patted Cas’s cheek and gave him a saucy smirk.
“You could retaliate with a humorous mug about him being a barely adequate heterosexual,” Cas suggested.
“C’mon Cas, let’s just have fun tonight,” Dean wheedled. “I wanna ride the bull. Can I ride the bull, babe?”
“So good,” Dean said. His heart was pounding. “Don’t suppose you want to get the knots out of my shoulders while you’re at it?” He licked his lips. “Promise I’ll return the favor when I’m feeling better.”
Cas smiled. “He will. He loves you, and he’s always been perfectly accepting of everyone in the LGBTQIA community.”
“No, it’s not,” Dean said scornfully. “Neither one of you is even dead. C’mon. Give it a little while to blow over and then talk to him. Meanwhile, I’m going to have a chat with Sammy. I know, Cas,” he added as Cas opened his mouth to start objecting. “I’m not going to go medieval on him, but I’m gonna find out what is going on. Promise I’ll behave.”
Dean had been trying to avoid thinking about what Sylvia and Gabriel were up to, and had particularly been trying to unhear the muffled thumps and squeaks from upstairs. “Sounds great, babe. Let’s just… put some music on while we cook.”
“No, Cas, I… just come in with me, okay?” And before he could protest further, Dean had grabbed him by the hand and pulled him through the door.
He woke up to the rustling sound of Cas settling into the chair next to him. Still in his white shirt, sleeves rolled up, and his dark pants, looking decidedly more rumpled than usual. Even his feet were bare for a change. It was both nice to see him so casual, the lines of his body so much more visible, and yet worrisome at the same time, knowing that Cas was only this undressed because his grace was on the fritz, drained because of Dean. He looked up at Cas’s face, which was crinkled with worry. “Stop fussing,” Dean murmured, even though he very much wanted Cas fussing over him.
Somewhere in Maryland they stopped at a truck stop, where Dean spent a good half hour dumping quarters into the claw machine until he was able to present Cas with a hideous stuffed green elephant. Cas grinned with delight and hugged it to him like it was the most amazing gift in the world, and Dean decided that all the effort had been worth it, even if he had been trying to get the cuddly teddy bear holding a heart instead.
Cas freed Dean of this last scrap of clothing, and he took a moment to appreciate the beauty of his body. It took his breath away, how lovely Dean was. Cas could have stared all day, but he knew that Dean was eager for his touch, practically begging for it, and Cas could hardly refuse him that. He stroked his fingertips over Dean’s cock, from tip to base and back up again. Dean seemed to like that, and he trailed his fingertips over and around it a few more times, gently, barely a tickle. He dragged his fingertip through the fluid dotting the tip, and poked it into his mouth curiously. When he looked up, Dean was staring at him wide-eyed.
There were about a dozen people, all clustered around a few long tables. Several elderly women, but the rest were women closer to Sylvia’s age, plus a few children. Most had already spread out projects on the tables and were working on things, or helping others figure out problems they were having. Most of them gave Cas a cursory glance and then went back to their work with a distracted, but not unfriendly “Hello” or “Welcome.”
“Look, there are a whole bunch of open seats there,” he said. “Why don’t we sit before we miss our chance.”
He was scrolling through Facebook one morning when he saw something that someone had posted. That chick Charlie, she always had the best memes. This one, though, was a link to an article about today being “Kiss a Ginger Day.” “Pucker up, bitches,” she had added. Well, Gabriel didn’t have a lot of interest in kissing her, but it did give him an idea.
“Mmm. Mmmhm,” Dean agreed. “You are the best, baby. The absolute best. I wish I could make you feel this good.”
“It made sense when we had problems because of everything Chuck was doing to us. But now that everything’s okay, everything’s supposed to be okay again. Which, I guess that means that she’s just not as into me as I am to her.” He reached up to wipe the tears on his cheeks. “Jeez, talk about raining on your parade.”
“Sorry. Uh. Yeah,” Dean said distractedly, closing the app and jamming his phone into his pocket. “Just. Answering messages.”
For the first time she told Cas the story of her father’s remarriage, the stepmother that hated her, the baby brother that she had loved but who had been carefully raised to hate her as well. By the time she had finally been able to leave for college, fleeing to New York, her brother had grown big enough and corrupted enough to hurt her with sick, delighted glee. She had never been back.
“What, because we’re old geezers we have to pack it in early?” Dean snorted. “And we just ran into an old friend. Family, even. Claire, Kaia, meet Gabriel.”
Sam seized Gabriel’s abandoned beer and took a long swallow. “Alright. Well, here goes. So last week, I tried to give Eileen a ring…”
“Selfish, Dean-O. That was Cas’s spin, not yours. Cas needs a kazoo, and a kick in the shin, more than you need to be able to open a beer.” He patted Cas’s cheek. Cas ducked away from the gesture.
They finished their desserts and Dean paid, with a generous tip. They got back in the car, but he didn’t get back on the highway. Instead he drove through the little town and turned down a smaller side road that soon gave way to a dirt road.
“I’m saying that I’m bi, okay. I’m bi- bisexual, I’ve been kinda into guys... for a long time, and… I just need you to know that about me.” Dean felt like he’d been punched in the gut, that kind of punch where you can’t draw a full breath afterward. He stood there waiting for Sam to react.
Cas looked over at the empty space on the bed and pictured what it would be like to have Dean lying there next to him. He could almost feel the warmth of Dean’s body, could almost smell him.
As soon as he had recovered enough to do so, Cas pulled Dean to his feet, even as Dean was swallowing the last drops. Dean found the toilet paper dispenser and yanked a wad of it to clean his hand off, and they both leaned against the wall, gasping for breath and sweaty. Cas brought his hand to Dean’s face, gently caressing his cheek. “Love you,” he whispered. Typically they’d follow up with a lengthy cuddling session with lots of tender kissing, but it didn’t seem practical in this case.
“I am on Lime Kiln Road, as you said. Dean, there are numerous farms here. They all have long unpaved driveways. You’re going to have to give me a mailbox number or perhaps another landmark.”
“I need to tell you- I need to tell you,” he said, pulling back until she could see his mouth, and freeing his hands to talk to her. “Eileen, I’m sorry. I should have told you right away. I kissed someone else. I might be kinda falling for him.”
“I’m so sorry,” she whispered, stricken. She placed a hand on his chest, over his heart, as if she could soothe it with a touch. “Oh, Gabe, I had no idea. I just didn’t want to be clingy. I went too far in the other direction, huh?”
“For the record, I didn’t mention to her that I’ve seen you,” Cas said. “Because I think that, thus far, you haven’t hurt her because she believes your lie; she believes that you had to cancel your plans for good reasons and that she’ll see you again soon. But if you continue to string her along…” Cas sighed. “Gabriel, she’s my friend. I will not assist you in lying to her. Especially not for a stupid reason.”
Dean grunted. He had thought Castiel was dead ten minutes ago, and if you’d asked him in that moment he would have said that he’d prefer Cas alive and with some girl in New Jersey with an archangel fetish rather than being dead, but the jealousy was hard to shake. He couldn’t help but feel like something was going to keep them apart, and if it wasn’t going to be death it might just end up being something stupid like this.
He also had to pee, which he thought was yet another unfortunate contradiction. He slipped out of the bed and walked to the bathroom, attempting to convince his body that, while he was willing to appease the urination, perhaps asking for sex again right now was too much.
Ten minutes later, Dean and Cas were sitting in the grass under a tree with their sandwiches and beers. Claire and Kaia had gotten walking tacos and headed back into the thick of the festival again, too restless and excited to sit still and miss anything. But Dean was content to take the opportunity for a quiet moment with Cas. He watched the crowds of people milling around nearby, and he spotted Sam’s head bobbing along above the crowd.
For a while they just stay like that, tucked away under the warmth of the covers, trading shallow kisses and soft moans tightly wrapped around each other. And to be frank, Castiel would be content to stay like that for the entire day, but he’s well aware that at least one of them is on a schedule.
get along. But it’s more about Benny having heard so much about Cas over the years without realizing that Dean was talking about Cas at the time, and his perception of Cas being therefore altered.
Castiel feels like every single one of his bones has been breaking ever since. His soul felt hollow before, but now it feels like it’s been shredded to pieces and put back together all sorts of wrong.
Dean takes a deep breath and half-opens the door to take a peek into the office. Cas is sitting in front of his computer, several tabs opened on one screen and his conversation with his colleagues on Discord opened on the other, seemingly immersed into prepping an article.
Cas decides that a fifth trip to the grocery store maybe wasn’t that much of a waste of time, after all.
Cas looks at him, his eyes following the line of Dean’s jaw before he picks up again, “I need you to know that. How much I’ve missed you.”
Charlie looks at both of them with tears in her eyes, her bottom lip slightly quivering. “It wasn’t my secret to tell. You both know me, you know that I would keep
Cas tries to ignore the way his heart constricts as he gets out of bed, the feeling of the cold floor underneath his feet sending a shiver through his spine. He gets out of their bedroom and finds the house silent, if not for the quiet purr of Leia on the couch downstairs. Holli doesn’t seem to be anywhere Cas can see, and that tells him enough about where Dean might be. He grabs one of Dean’s jackets from the coat rack and pushes the front door.
“You have no idea,” Cas pants as he tugs him down further and maintains him here, Dean’s nose tickling the patch of dark hair down his pleasure trail, the head of his cock resting against the back of Dean’s throat. “How insanely hot you look like that.”
Teddy finally leaves the room after patting Cas’ shoulder one last time, yanking back the curtains behind him to give them their privacy back, and Dean and Cas are finally alone in the room again.
Cas blinks tiredly before a smile stretches out on his lips. He looks tired, but his hand squeezes Dean’s tightly and he turns his head just enough to brush a kiss on Dean’s inner wrist before answering, his mouth still hovering on Dean’s skin.
Somehow that’s what does Dean in. That’s what makes his heart leap in his throat, and he can’t help but smile back at Cas.
He sees it on Dean’s face. The moment his mind catches up to what Jimmy has just thrown at his head. The look of pure despair and agony. And he hates it with a passion, knowing that he’s the one who put it there.
Mary had complained. Sam had nodded as he watched him leave, keys in hands. And now there Dean is, standing once again in the arrival hall, tear tracks on his cheek, waiting for Cas to arrive. Because if there’s one thing John Winchester isn’t going to take away from his son even in death, it’s the tradition of him picking up Cas from the airport every time he comes back.
He pats Cas’ shoulder on his way out of the kitchen, already on his way to make good on the promise he made to Sam yesterday- cataloging artifacts in the library so that they can finally start going through the clutter of the archive.
“I’ll do my best,” Benny laughs as he lets him go. “I kinda like it here. Might come back once I retire.”
Dean’s hands are still on him, still possessively clutching his hips like he’s afraid of letting go. His lips crash one last time against his mouth, but it’s soft, tentative, tender and Cas’ sighs when Dean’s tongue drags at the swell of his lower lip before retreating.
What is Jimmy supposed to say? That Dean has ceased all contact with everyone here in Lawrence except for his brother and Charlie? That all the news he gets from him are the monthly texts he made him promise to send, to ensure that he’s still alive? That he’s entirely responsible for the fact that Dean left?
Alright. It's here. It's long as fuck. I will be standing by for all the yelling. See you next update for another big one, until then the comment section and my Tumblr inbox are yours :)
Dean has been nothing but understanding towards him. Sitting next to him whenever he has a breakdown, holding his hand when he breaks into tears. Even tucking him into bed a few times he wasn’t even able to hold onto his feet after yet another mental breakdown.
Dean chuckles, looking up at the stars like they hold some kind of response to the clusterfuck that is his life.
He sent a few texts which Dean never responded to, only fueling his despair about the whole thing. And now it’s late at night and Dean’s still not here, and Cas still has no idea where he’s gone. For all he knows he might have fucked off all the way back to Virginia already, and he hates how that makes him feel.
Which is stupid, by the way, because there’s no way anything is going to happen between him and Dean ever again.
It only takes half a second for the nurse to recognize who he’s asking about, but that half of a second of blank face in front of him is enough to send Dean’s mind into a loop of fear, and he has to grip the edges of the counter to stay upright.
Dean tends to get up around 8 when Cas is in his post-run shower. He usually goes for coffee, finds out Cas got him a cup from Charlie's and spends the next half-hour sipping on it while watching cartoons on TV or reading the newspaper. Then he leaves for PT around 9. Now that he’s familiar with the hospital’s process and since his doctor thinks it’s good for him, he trains almost every day at the hospital. He comes back for lunch usually with sandwiches from Charlie’s (sometimes with records, when he can’t help himself because some repress from one of his favorite albums came in and “it’s a
Dean shivers at the loss of his weight against him, almost wanting to reach for it but deciding better of it.
“So what do I do with this? How do I make it stop?” Castiel asks, trying to keep his nerves down. “How do I- How can I explain this to Dean, to make it up?”
Dean just shrugs, the subject rapidly becoming too heavy. Castiel seems to realize because the change of subject is abrupt.
Sam raises his eyes and watches as Dean makes his way to the counter, pouring himself a cup of coffee and grabbing some pancakes he made the day before to reheat.
At that, Cas literally howls with laughter, pushing his face into his pillow and apparently unable to stop laughing like an absolute asshole.
“Okay no,” Charlie says and Jimmy looks back at her with surprise. “I’m really fucking mad at you right now, but that doesn’t mean I’m going to let you take all the misery of the world on your back. Dean being in a hospital bed is not on you.”
Both his arms have found their way around the former angel’s waist and are now tucked under his shirt — well, really,
Once it’s out in the open, there’s no taking it back. Cas’ eyes look even brighter in front of him. And maybe it’s the way the sun is slowly setting in front of them, highlighting him in a light orange glow, or maybe it’s just Dean being a lovesick idiot. But Dean could swear he feels part of his heart stitch back together as Cas moves closer, mouth hovering just mere inches from Dean’s own.
Dean saying Cas deserves better. Dean pushing him away even though his entire body seemed to crave his touch. Dean’s sad smile whenever anyone mentioned Jimmy. Dean’s over-the-top self-loathing.
That’s how half of their stuff got here, including the fluffy carpet Castiel is lying on right now. He’s so lost in his thought that he doesn’t hear the front door open and doesn’t realize he’s not alone anymore until Balthazar’s voice chimes in from the corridor.
“So I’m guessing that big old sigh means troubles at home? What’s up with Cas, you finally get your head out of your ass?” Benny says and Dean can almost picture the grin on his stupid face.
. And every time I watch you leave I keep it shut because I know you’re living your dream, and I know that I’m being unfair by even trying t--”
It takes several minutes for any of them to talk again, the quiet of Cas’ room only disturbed by his own breathing and Dean’s over the phone slowly returning to normal. Cas cleans himself up with his own shirt- he meant to change it anyway- and strips down before snuggling into bed.
“I really do,” Dean smiles, his green eyes so full of love that Cas feels like he’s taken a lightning bolt to the heart.
“I want everything about you, Dean Winchester,” Cas says, both hands framing Dean’s face as he kisses him and kisses him and kisses him. “You stupid, beautiful idiot.”
They meet at the strangest hours. At 4 am when Dean is cursing against a digital enemy while he’s playing Call of Duty in the living room, or at 2 am when Dean stumbles upon Cas eating cereal straight out of the box while watching an episode of The Boys on his tablet. Cas is usually up by 6 am regardless of the time he went to bed, takes at least 3 cups of coffee before he’s fully functional and when he finally is, leaves for a run. When Dean doesn’t have PT he tends to get up late in the morning, enjoying the peace and quiet.
Because this is life, and there’s an angel of the Lord that’s set to become his husband tightly wrapped around him, there’s a house somewhere that waits on them to make a home out of it, there’s a little girl slowly falling asleep in her bed a few feet away that holds everyone’s heart, there’s his little brother content and happy and cared for with a wife that’s not only a badass but one of Dean’s bestest friends in the world.
So he raises up on his elbow again and kisses him, his tongue swiping on the swell of his bottom lip before licking into his mouth. After a minute he draws back just enough to look at Cas in the eyes.
talk,” Cas snarls, locking eyes with him. The venom dancing around the edges of each and every single one of his words hits Dean right in the face. “You want to talk? Really? You don’t ever fucking say a
It looks like he’s lost 15 years and he’s back to being a little boy afraid of what’s to come. He looks just like he did after Mary’s death, or after John bailed, and Cas’ heart shatters even more at the sight.
There’s a whimper at the end of the line and the arousal in Cas’ guts punches through him at the sound. He can’t resist slowly gripping his own cock from where it’s straining against the fabric of his boxers, stroking lazily as he listens to Dean. His lips curl into a smile and he can’t help but bite down his lower lip to keep himself from moaning slowly.
“I know this hurts,” Dean keeps going, voice as smooth as ever as he presses him ever so closer. “And it’s shit, and it doesn’t change the fact that this entire situation is still fucked up. I’m still mad, I’ll be mad for a long time. But now I understand why he did it. And maybe, somewhere down the line, I’ll be able to forgive him.”
Jimmy was his best friend. He knew everything about him. Why did he choose to deliberately break him to pieces? Why did he decide to hurt his own brother?
for a piece that you can see toward the end of this chapter, and I'm reeeeeally excited for you guys to finally see it!
“Alright, ask away,” Cas sighs as Dean serves him. “But I can’t guarantee my answers are going to be as colorful as yours.”
I had really hoped that being here, away from home and from you would help me heal, help me let you go. And the miles between us did help for a while, but healing is harder to come by than I had thought, no matter how much I try to, and no matter the view from my window.
He looks sick, there are no other words for it. The pale, sallow complexion of his skin tells Jimmy everything there is to know about how far gone he is. If anything, the mess of tubes attached to his nose and hand tells the rest of the story for itself.
Cas’ voice breaks again and something inside Dean does at the same time, too. He rolls on his side as if on cue, ignoring the ache in his back in favor of pressing himself in-between Cas’ arms instead. Cas immediately wraps around him, legs slotting easily between his as he places his face into the crook of Dean’s neck.
Cas smiles. It takes so much energy out of him, but Dean is crying, and he doesn’t want his last image on Earth to be of the love of his life
Dean’s voice breaks on his brother’s name, and suddenly Castiel feels the pain flooding his guts again, and closes his eyes briefly on impact.
Whenever you were next to me, there was no rest of the world. There were no stars painting light to the darkness. No wind to carry our names through the grass. To me, there was only ever you.
“Dean —,” Cas says, and his voice is almost quivering, to the point where Dean starts to feel his resolve crumble.
Cas sighs before he sits on his bed and draws up his knee to his chest. Jimmy’s entire being hurts at the sight, at how small his brother looks. And he hates it.
They’re silent for a moment, Cas breathing a little easier. He can hear the sound of the shower spray still, meaning that Dean is still under water. He relaxes into the couch, eyes fixated on the outside view.
They’re in the car when they start talking again. Cas had tried talking Dean out of driving, obviously seeing right through the facade that he’s trying to put on. But the truth is he’s no better than Dean, if the bags under his eyes aren’t enough of a clue he’s also heavily jet-lagged.
You might have noticed that we went from 13 to 18 as far as chapters are concerned. This is because I, in true chaotic form, woke up in the middle of the night (after spending a tremendous amount of time outlining this entire story to the core), thinking
Tears are streaming down Cas’ face and he looks so fragile that Jimmy can’t help but push his feelings aside and grab his brother, wrapping him up into a hug. Cas goes easily, fitting his face into the crook of his brother’s neck, and Jimmy cards a hand through Cas’ mess of hair.
And then the cat perked up at the sound of Dean’s voice, and Cas watched as Dean’s face transformed into something wildly different from the annoyed look that had started to appear.
So here we finally are. This is a chapter that left me reeling, of which I wrote the entire dialog down weeks ago because it wouldn't leave my head. For those who follow me on Twitter, you might have seen me around that time say that I had "just wrote the most gut-wrenching thing I had ever written in my entire life". This is, in my opinion, where the story changes path, and I'm really excited but also
Cas cradles his jaw with one hand, the other firmly pressed into Dean’s naked shoulder over the burn marks.
Dean swallows. This is dangerous territory and something he hasn’t stated to anyone but Bobby just a couple of days before.
“Nothing’s wrong, I just-,” Cas says before stopping, finally tearing his gaze away from his thumb on Dean’s lip to stare at his eyes instead. “I never thought you’d want to quit.”
“It’s 3 AM on a Wednesday night and I’m walking home from a bar I didn’t even want to be out at in the first place,” Cas chuckles. “Sometimes I just hate being a good friend.”
“Making it for a special lady?” Angie asked, brushing his hand as she stroked the yarn. “Ooh, that’s soft!”
Cas’s face crinkled in sympathy. “I’m truly sorry.” He waved to the server, who brought another whiskey. Cas wasn’t sure what else to do; usually when applying alcohol to Dean, he got less emotional and eventually clammed up and tucked all his problems away. He certainly never burst into tears and started talking about his terrible childhood. Cas wasn’t sure if this was better or worse.
“I never told him. Can you imagine what he’d do? He’s all… vengeance.” She sighed. “I don’t want that. I just… I wanted them to love me.” And with that she crumbled into tears again, leaning against the wall. “I want to not be so messed up by them that it’s messing everything else up. This is why… this is why I’m like…” she hiccuped.
“Something like that,” Cas said, putting the bottle of grapefruit melon moisturizer in the cart and eyeing the lip gloss display. “I miss you, Dean. It’s so nice to hear your voice.”
“I don’t even wanna know what my face looks like,” he sighed. The young helper gave him a wide-eyed look and nodded ever so slightly.
“Dean, we’ve beaten each other bloody, nearly to death on several occasions, to say nothing of the times we were on opposite sides of conflicts, deceived each other, went incommunicado for-”
Cas woke up in the morning to full sunlight peeking in around the blinds. Dean was sprawled out on his back, snoring. His legs were across Dean’s, and Dean had one arm thrown across his stomach. Cas was hard, just enough that it was slightly annoying. He thought it was a bizarre quirk of a human body, to want sex again so soon after such wonderful sex. But the longer he looked at Dean, the more he wanted it.
He ended up sitting on the floor with Cas’s mug, now topped off with whiskey. He let it burn its way down his throat as the tears flowed. It had been ten days now but it still felt like he was sitting against the dungeon wall, unable to process the magnitude of this loss. His toast went cold, forgotten in the toaster. He’d never be able to choke it past the pain of his broken heart, anyway.
Cas leaned over him and began rubbing his shoulders with both hands, and Dean suddenly realized that he was about to have a whole new swelling problem. Maybe he’d let this get carried a bit too far. Maybe it was the drugs making him bold; he wasn’t sure what all they’d given him but surely he could blame the drugs? Then he heard the sound of the shower turning off and the clickity-snickity of the shower curtain opening. Ugh, Sam. Sam was still here. Sam was about to come out of the bathroom and Cas was massaging him and it was already weird and-
“I thought that the driver traditionally picked the music,” Castiel said, squinting at the back of Dean’s head.
She turned toward a nearby table and dug out a her canvas project bag from beneath a stack of books and magazines. Then she dug further in the pile and found a rolled pouch containing an assortment of knitting needles.
None of the parts stores in Sylvia’s town had the right part, but fortunately there was one in stock just about fifteen miles away. The busy multi-lane roadway through the shopping district just outside of her neighborhood soon gave way to a limited access highway, tree-lined and oddly desolate in this overgrown sprawl of suburban neighbhorhoods and commerce. At the exit, they waited to make the left across a steady stream of traffic coming out of an office park, Sylvia growing increasingly irritable. Finally she nosed her way through until they had no choice but to let her cross, both she and the other parties honking and cursing.
“It’s… actually kind of hot,” Dean admitted. “Huh. Only on you, Cas.” He headed toward the bathroom, pausing to give Cas another look, then a full once-over and a wink.
Dean choked out a “yeah” somewhere in the noises he was making. Cas somehow managed to unfasten his pants and slide them down his hips without so much as brushing against his erection, which was desperate for his touch. Dean stepped out of the jeans now puddled around his ankles and reached to pull Cas close again, but Cas seemed to be the one in charge now, crowding him backwards until Dean’s legs hit the bed and they tumbled into it together.
“Thanks, Cas,” Dean said gruffly. He started walking again, and Cas fell into step beside him, their fingers brushing together with every step. It was hard to resist the urge to simply grab his hand as they walked along. The thought scared Dean, but it didn’t really surprise him. It wasn’t the first time he’d thought about holding Cas’s hand. But, without a good solid reason to do so, he couldn’t very well just grab it.
“I suppose you’re correct.” Cas picked up his phone and banged out a quick text to Sam and Eileen, then another to Claire and Kaia, informing them of the brunch invitation, side-eying Dean the whole time. Dean huffed in irritation and glared at him.
The kitchen smelled delicious when they opened the door. Sylvia was just pulling the lasagna out of the oven, all browned and bubbly.
“Thanks,” Gabe said, blinking. He thought for a minute, and sighed. “Here’s the thing. I love her. I do, I really love Sylvia. I love you too, Sam. And I love Kali. And they’re all different, and they’re all overlapping, and they... flow up and down sometimes. Now Kali, I think I’m almost over her. You… well I’m not going to get over you, but I’m okay with just being your pal and it doesn’t hurt. Much. Sylvia… that’s fresh and raw and I just let myself fall way, way too hard. And it’s worse because she’s the last one I should let get involved in any of my crap. I was a fool fifteen years ago, and I’m way more of a fool now.” He looked over at Sam and noticed that his jaw was hanging open. “Sam?”
She waited until she crawled into bed to start crying this time. The least she could do was not drag Castiel down into her grief when he was so happy.
“Another archangel, yes. Michael, he was always the most powerful. It wasn’t even the Michael from our world that we had known, but a different one. I’m sure this is all very confusing and strange. As far as the demon, he had help from some demigods with spellwork. And Gabriel was perhaps too careless there as well. Not that I’m criticizing him, believe me. I’ve made worse mistakes.”
Dean pulled on clothes. His usual clothes. Faded jeans, a gray Led Zeppelin t-shirt, his boots. He tied his purple flannel around his waist. He hadn’t remembered packing it but it was at the top of the bag so on it went, though he was certain it wouldn’t get cool enough today to require it. Then he started layering on his usual weapons. They hardly hunted anymore, but getting out of the habit of being fully armed was a good way to end up dead, and Dean was no idiot. After a final glance in the mirror, he grabbed Cas's hand and led him out the door.
Margo went up next, some sexy Britney Spears number. Sylvia and her friends cheered her on as she danced and sang through the whole thing. Afterward she wandered over to the bar and let men buy her drinks. She didn’t seem to have any intention of going home alone.
“Of course I want!” Cas’s fingers dug into Dean’s forearm where he held on, and Dean noticed how chilly they felt, and how he was trembling.
“We should see ourselves out,” Sam said, grabbing Gabriel’s elbow roughly and steering him out to the hallway, pulling the door shut behind him. He didn’t let go, continuing to shove Gabriel toward the library, where he finally let him go and stood facing him.
Cas’s eyes were shining as he clutched his armful of prizes. “I’m glad you got yourself something too. Though I wouldn't mind competing in one of these to get you a gift.”
Castiel sighed. He was warm and content at Dean’s side and he didn’t want to move, but his traitorous body was insisting that urination needed to occur yet again. He slipped carefully out of the bed, blew a kiss to Dean, and went to the bathroom.
Dean zoned out as they drew his blood and adjusted his IV, as Sam answered medical history questions as best he could. His swollen hands ached terribly, and the burning of each sting was starting to give way to itching. He desperately wanted to scratch everywhere, but his hands wouldn’t let him, even if that was a good idea. He caught sight of his bare legs peeking under the hospital gown and saw at least a dozen hugely swollen spots on them, ranging from golf ball to tennis ball sized. “I look like shit,” he muttered. And now his face hurt, too.
“Ohhh thinkin’ about our younger years,” he crooned. The dwindling bar patrons had pretty much tuned out from the karaoke experience at this point; they were not expecting the beauty and emotion of Dean’s voice. People were suddenly all looking at the stage again. “There was only you and me, we were young and wild and free.” He thought about the early days of the first apocalypse. Cas rebelling for free will. For him.
“Hey Gabe,” he said. “Somehow I think you could arrange a great view if you wanted. Like, conjure up a VIP box with champagne and underwear models.”
Dean felt like he’d been hit by lightning. It wasn’t, it couldn’t be. “Who is this?” he demanded angrily.
Dean fumbled his phone out of his pocket and snapped a series of photos as Cas readied himself, pulled back the hammer, braced himself for maximum strength, and swung. Dean was so busy appreciating the way his muscles rippled, the sweat that made his t-shirt stick to him, and the little grunt that reminded him of other exertions, that he almost didn’t notice that the bell rung until Sam started applauding and hollering.
They got a hotel room, a little nicer than the Winchesters’ usual standards. “Swanky,” Dean proclaimed it as they walked in. He set their bags down and kicked the door shut.
The pager finally buzzed, and they were shown to a tiny table against the wall in the back section. There were a few other couples, and two large tables with big family gatherings. Several high chairs with babies and toddlers were among them, one of whom was staring at Dean. He made a silly face at her, and she giggled and squirmed in her seat. When he looked back at Cas, Cas was looking at him with an absolutely soppy expression.
Castiel still looked sulky, but he seemed mollified by that. “Finish your sandwich,” he said, holding it up to Dean’s lips. Dean sucked the last of it into his mouth, giving Cas’s thumb a lick for good measure. “So can we go?” he asked around the mouthful.
Gabriel stuffed the cheese stick into his mouth and chewed it thoughtfully. “Yeah, that’s fair,” he agreed. “Wish I knew more, myself.”
“Nicer in the backseat,” Dean said. He fumbled with the tape deck. Led Zeppelin began to play. He glanced over at Cas. “Whadda ya say, handsome? Little backseat smoochin’?”
She took the disgusting bin out with her, and then Cas and Sam came back in. Sam was holding an open bag of Doritos. “Dude, no,” Dean said. “Get them out of here, asshole.” He could smell the stinky cheese powder and it was threatening his stomach again.
Dean whimpered a little as Cas pulled his fingers free. Dean sat up and pulled out a condom with practiced ease and rolled it on for him, squirted a blob of lube on and stroked Cas up and down a few times. “Are you ready, sweetheart?” Dean asked, looking into his eyes. “If you need to, we stop any time, capiche?”
True to his word, Dean made short work of the carnival games. He popped balloons with darts and got the aforementioned giant teddy bear. He tossed rings around bottles, one after another, and got a pink inflatable baseball bat. He squirted the clown’s mouth with a water pistol until the balloon popped, and got a giant plush chocolate donut. He threw a baseball and knocked over stacks of bottles and got a mirrored Led Zeppelin picture. “Okay, that one’s for me,” he admitted. “It’s going to look awesome hanging in the Dean cave, ain’t it babe?”
He didn’t know if this was how allergies worked or if it was the drugs they gave him, but he was exhausted. He woke briefly again when the nurse came to check on stuff, and he saw Sammy sitting in the chair over to the side. The next time he woke up, Sam was shaking his shoulder.
Cas concentrated his grace and poured it into Dean. It was a difficult healing; there was so much damage, and Cas was lightheaded by the time he’d finished. But at last, Dean’s arm looked good as new, and his breathing and his color returned to normal. Still, Cas didn’t want to let him go. They sat quietly for a long moment before they finally pulled apart and began cleaning up.
“Seems that you and she had been planning to come here together, but last week you told her that some important celestial business came up and you couldn’t make it.” Cas stopped walking and turned to face Gabriel, his arms folded across his chest.
“My point exactly.” Dean picked up the song booklet from the table and started flipping through it. Nora was up on stage, rocking out to “It’s Raining Men.” The rest of the gang were cheering and egging her on.
The dresser drawers contained almost nothing. A pair of pajamas, a pair of jeans and a few t-shirts. The hooks on the wall behind the door held a red hoodie, a pair of slacks and a suit jacket on hangers.
“Yeah, Dean,” Sam said in his ‘duh’ voice. “I mean, I didn’t know they went camping but… like, Claire was devastated when she thought Kaia was dead, because they were in love.”
Dean slid into the empty chair between them and picked up an onion ring. “‘Sup, Gabe?” he said. “You met Eileen yet? Eileen, this is Gabe. Old friend from way back.”
“Let me see,” he demanded, pulling the coat away as the flames died down. Dean’s face was contorted in pain and he was gasping and panting.
Dean licked his lips and surged forward. His hands skimmed down Cas’s side as they kissed, and he worked his shirt up inch by inch, palming over his skin as he did so. When they broke off, panting, he pulled the shirt over his head, and let Cas yank his own shirt off, before they dove back into the kiss again.
They both moaned together as he slid in, slowly at first, then with a snap of his hips he was all the way in. “Syl, oh sweetness,” he murmured against her hair. “You feel amazing. Is this good for you, kiddo?”
“I want to kiss you,” Cas replied. He’d scarcely finished the sentence when their lips met, and they melted into each other.
I just want you to know that I probably would have had this chapter done weeks ago if I hadn't been googling photos of portable zip line rentals and Dean insisted that he wanted to do that. I just couldn't argue with him. Anyway, that's what stalled me and I'm sticking to blaming Dean.
Dean laughed. “Cuddle positions, sweetheart. Tell you what, why don’t we start you out with little spoon and see how that works for you.” He nudged Cas around until he could press his front against Cas’s back. “You get to feel more snuggled this way, but on the other hand you wake up being poked by morning wood. Just give me a shove if you want me to back off, k?”
“No, no. When you get here. I’ll show ya. I know how you love bees,” Dean said softly. “And, uh. There’s something I wanna talk to you about. I’ve been wanting to…” Dean had withdrawn his hand from the hive without grabbing anything, realizing that he had nothing to put the honey in, and maybe he could figure something out when Cas got here. But the swarm of insects that came out of the hive after he had disturbed it weren’t honeybees. They were a lot more menacing. Too late, he realized that the honeybees hadn’t been around because their hive had been attacked by wasps and they’d either fled or been killed.
