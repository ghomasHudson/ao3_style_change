well and truly good, but it doesn’t exactly take all of his concentration. His attention wanders off and, with it, his emotions. On the one hand, he knows he’s been doing everything in his power to keep the team together and legit and keep them from being tyrants, and he thinks—hopes, desperately—that the rest of the team understands that now. On the other hand, Tony should’ve done more, should’ve been better, but he doesn’t know how. Everyone shoots blame at him, but nobody can seem to tell him what he should’ve done differently. He’s a convenient scapegoat, he knows: when things go right it’s just his duty to give back to the people he profited off of for so long, when things go wrong it’s because he wasn’t paying attention, didn’t try hard enough, was sleeping on the job—
“Whoops,” Scott says when he tips his bottle up only to find it empty. “I need another beer. Want one?”
“Let’s call a spade a spade, shall we?” Bruce says, leaning forward. He sounds well and truly angry now. Tony catches sight of Peter’s wide eyes and clenches his jaw when Bruce’s eyes land on him. “You need therapy? That’s great, Tony, it really is. What I could do without is your projecting. This is a personal issue for you, and the rest of us aren’t beholden to what you think is best at any moment.”
Natasha nods slowly. Tony can only see it out of the corner of his eye; they’re both still sitting against the side of the tub, facing the door.
I’m so mad at you, Tony thinks. I hate you, and I want you to fix that, and I know that’s unfair, and I don’t really give a shit if it is or not. I ran out of words until this exact moment, or I thought I had, so what the fuck is this? Why won’t you stop haunting me? I know I have a huge karma debt, but why is this how I have to pay it? I’m so hurt, and it’s because of you, and I thought you were supposed to be better than this. How dare you be human, how could you be everybody else’s hero while stomping me into the ground. I wanted, so desperately, and I thought we actually were friends for a while there—I actually thought. I can handle that, Steve, I can get shit on and smile all the while, what I can’t handle is the pendulum effect: friends—enemies, hero—villain, wanted—disgusting, speaking—screaming—begging—fighting—fighting—fighting—
from me?” Tony asks, showing his cards just that much more than he probably should, but this is Bruce.
Bruce slips away from Tony so he’s leaning against the wall of the elevator, blinking slowly at Tony like he’s confused as to how they got there. The feeling Tony gets looking at him isn’t betrayal either, but it’s—something. If he had to hazard a guess, Tony might say abandonment. Which he recognizes as ridiculous, thank you very much, since he’s not
“—whatever you need.” Steve looks frankly terrible. Manic, like he did that first month after DC, when he thought every idle moment was another nail in Bucky’s coffin. “Whatever you need to come home and feel safe there.”
“Yeah,” Steve says, and Tony tries (and fails) not to feel ridiculously relieved at Steve’s recovered ability to track a conversation. The doctor simply nods.
has very little to do with it,” Tony says, shrugging in a way that feels almost cruel. “There’s room enough at the compound for anyone who doesn’t want to be an active member of this team. Rules apply to active members only, of course. If at any point you wanna quit—poof, no more therapy needed.” And then, because he feels like he needs to spell everything out carefully here, lest assumptions be made, “Though, even if you quit, the choice of therapy isn’t retracted. Nobody is obligated to earn room and board, just so that’s clear here.”
“Walt reminds me a little of Obie,” Tony says at one point, surprising even himself. Obie’s not someone he talks about most of the time. There were a couple of instances, right after he went public as Iron Man, with Rhodey or Pepper or, once, at his dad’s grave, when he was first trying to make sense of the betrayal in his own head, working through it, still processing as he stood there in the mud upstate. Never with the Avengers, though, or any member of the public. Hell, thanks to Coulson, the general population still thinks Obie died suddenly in a plane crash, and that Tony misses him dearly as a father figure. Really, he doesn’t recall ever having said the man’s name in front of Steve before. There’s a brief pause before Steve replies.
“No,” Tony counters, “not good. The leader of the Avengers really shouldn’t be flying off the handle like some sort of….me. Like another Tony Stark. Christ, the team can hardly handle one me. Some would argue that the team can’t even handle one me. The man better get his head out of his ass and start leading or I’m gonna have to stage an uprising.”
It takes Tony a second too long to realize what Steve’s doing, and when it finally clicks he rolls his eyes skyward.
Tony’s busy, he’s probably got things to do other than listen to Steve desperately trying to breathe over an outdated phone line.
“Right," Clint says, sounding about as sarcastic as the situation calls for (which is to say very) and swings the backpack off, propping it up against the wall instead of offering it to Tony.
“Sam’s not up yet?” Tony says. He tosses the tablet and the USB on the table and walks past it to dump the dishes in the sink and grab a cup of coffee.
And then he feels a little jolt of panic, swallows it down. He finishes his drink, sets it on the floor, and forces himself to tune back in to the competition unfolding in front of him. Clint and Vis have decided that standard shots aren’t working as a measurement of their skill because it’s just too easy for the both of them, and have moved on to increasingly ridiculous trick shots.
“No,” Natasha says, low and dangerous and not a shout at all, and obviously all the more serious for it.
“It might’ve been fine for a smaller team,” Tony says, rather diplomatically, in his opinion. “But there’s enough of us now, we need to be more—democratic, if we want this to work.”
of you to keep in the spirit of that,” Sam says. He lets the statement sit for a moment before continuing with a sideways grin, “Even if I was looking forward to everyone getting put in their places, just a bit.”
“Okay,” Steve says, "so it took some extreme measures for her to change her mind. Are you saying you think we shouldn’t have let her help us when she realized the extent of Ultron’s plans?”
Steve even suggests Team Bonding Nights as an extra measure. They won’t be made mandatory, because they’re all adults and can manage their own free time, which they don’t get a lot of anyway. However, attendance will be highly encouraged. They talk about that for a while, how to avoid making anyone feel excluded or unwanted, and they decide to rotate who gets to choose the food as well as the “bonding activity.” (Seriously, though, when did this become the Great Tony Stark’s life? Howard’s ghost is probably having an aneurysm right now.)
He wishes, again, desperately, a little pathetically, that there was something to do today. Another lead to chase, or a kitten stuck in a tree he could save, or a Tony Stark around to annoy the hell out of him (and bring him into the present, into the moment, out of his head). There isn’t though. They’re still playing the waiting game with a contact, waiting to confirm some intel they’ve been hearing whispers of. They’ve been sitting in northern France for a week and a half now, and Steve’s getting restless, which is to say he’s becoming aware of how depressed he is and how much he wants to go home, and he knows he can do fuck-all about it. He wants a distraction. Sam gets it, to a certain degree, but even he’s starting to lose patience. They have a semi-working TV—basic cable only, and Sam doesn’t know French, but he’s started watching anyway. And Steve, well, he can take a hint, so he’s stuck to his bedroom mostly, and tried to draw, and nothing comes out right—Bucky gets drawn as the Winter Soldier, but somehow with Tony’s tear-filled eyes like they were in Siberia—and before he knows it he’s crying, again, and he’s never been much of a crier, or one for homesickness, but here he is, sitting in a room that isn’t his, without his shield, calling himself the fucking Nomad as he cries. It’s stupid and awful and he promised himself he wasn’t going to spend today like that, so he’s been sitting in the living room with Sam trying to be normal, functional, and all he wants is sleep his body doesn’t really need.
The scorn and contempt his six-month-ago self would be giving him if they met; the look of awe his ten-year-old self would shoot up at him, desperate and hopeful. He feels every version of himself up until this point staring at him, at who he apparently is now. It’s not a bad feeling, necessarily, but it’s sure as hell heavy.
“I’m pretty sure,” Tony says, ignoring the water bottle and dropping his head back to look up at her, “that I don’t have any bananas.”
Steve and Rhodey both feel like coming home, but—it’s different. What he feels for Steve is obviously different than what he feels for Rhodey, but not just the same feelings of friendship to a different degree. Just—different feelings, altogether. Rhodey’s his brother, and they’ve fought side-by-side, and he’s unconditional, familial love, the kind he’s only ever really felt from his mom and the human Jarvis and his wife. Knowing Rhodey’s there is knowing he has someone no matter what, like knowing that at least someone will move hell or high water when he goes missing.
The living room’s empty when he gets there, a tablet under one arm and the HUD glasses on, but he’s not sure he should’ve expected anything else. It’s awfully late at this point, but with a whole compound’s worth of people sticking around these days, it’s never uncommon to run into at least someone, no matter the time of day.
Sam and Thor are both hovering around Steve’s crumpled form, carefully not touching him. And he’s breathing—that’s the first thingTony sees. Blood, too. There’s blood dripping down his temple, and on his chest, spreading out from four different points on the front of his uniform.
Steve's breathing evens out as he drops off to sleep, more slowly in here than the times they’ve slept on the couch, or maybe Tony’s just more aware.
Barefoot, he pads down the hall. Steve’s door is cracked, but Tony raps his knuckles against the wood twice as he pushes it open anyway.
One hand still playing in Steve’s hair, Tony smirks and says, “Hey, Fri? Let’s get the ball rolling, yeah?”
It’s probably a defense mechanism, Tony thinks. If they put their kids in human skin, a human will be much more hesitant to kill them. It’s sick, but good strategy.
Tony doesn’t say. Can’t. He’s not sorry, not for this. If this ends up being what Steve leaves him over—if this is what makes him give up and step back from whatever it is they’re feeling out—then so be it. He’s Iron Man. He just
And the real kicker is that Tony desperately wants to be able to help his teammates. He wants them to be okay, to not be carrying around emotional wounds, and he would’ve built something to keep them safe in that way, too, if he knew how.
“Why would they be?” Clint shoots back. Tony blinks. He didn’t loose that much blood at all but he’s in an adrenaline drop and a little slow on the uptake.
“The way I see it,” he says, forcing his tone to lighten, “we’ve officially fought on the same side now more than we’ve fought each other, and I—trust you in the field. I also want to make sure everyone in this room feels safe with each other, in this compound, and on this team. And I think this is at least part of how we do that.”
Howard had said, looking down into the half-dissected guts of his Ford Flathead Roadster. He’d looked, to Tony’s brain then, unhappy. Feelings he now understands as a mix between exhaustion, overwhelmed, and anxious.
“What’d I do this time?” Tony asks, hardly looking up from the hologram he’s inspecting. Steve doesn’t sound mad, so he figures it can’t be too bad.
"I'll go intercept the Quinjet then," he says. “With any luck, they’ll be through with the UN debrief by the time I get there.”
“Certainly not,” Tony says, scandalized. “Technically speaking, anyway. Though I appreciate the poetic sentiment. Actually…Dummy might count, but even that’s a bit of a stretch.”
So Tony types and he wants and he tries desperately not to think too much beyond those simple facts.
Steve kills the engine and the silence rings, broken by some bird Tony hears a lot out here, but he doesn’t have a clue what it is.
The battle continues on like this. Steve, Natasha, and Scott are all making steady if slow progress on the ground; Clint, Tony, and Sam calling out positions and warnings and angles from up high; Clint picking them off with arrows; Tony and Sam circling low to keep the perimeter; Wanda’s got one pinned up against a brick-faced building, and Vision’s at her back, keeping her clear.
“I know I said I would listen,” Steve says, crease between his eyebrows and toothy smile on his face, “but that means you have to talk.”
“At least he wasn’t actively dying?” Pepper says, voice dripping with saccharine sarcasm. Rhodey shrugs theatrically, lifting his hands palm-up over his head.
"Don't be," Steve says on a sigh. They both melt a little farther into the couch after that, and Tony stops worrying about being too heavy on top of Steve.
“I’m not saying you have to—or should—stand near a ledge with her,” Tony says. He shrugs. “Maybe you should talk to her, though.” Bruce is still looking down at his phone, but Tony doesn’t think he’s looking at much of anything on the screen. “Y’know. For the sake of the team.”
“If our baseline for alien invasions is the Chitauri,” Tony says, “then this is a relatively small attack. I’m estimating a couple hundred hostiles based on what I can see from the sky.”
“It’s probably fine,” Tony rationalizes, because it probably is, and he feels somehow even more like a doofus with Steve trying to validate Tony’s unease over what’s likely most definitely nothing.
“I had strings, but now I’m free,” he sing-songs a little hysterically, “there are no strings on me.”
“Yes,” he puts his hands up and makes a frame like he’s a director on set, looking straight at the king, “but, you see. If I want the Avengers to stay together, all on the same continent even, I need Steve.” He drops his hands and smiles helplessly at T’Challa. “And if I want Steve, I need Bucky, and if I unfreeze Bucky without Rogers there, I’ll get thrown through a window.”
Bruce stumbles in next and is sliding onto a barstool before he seems to register the spread expanding out around him. He sigh-huffs and rises again, snagging a plate and putting it upside down over the top of the toaster, pulling the lever down (because this is a thing Bruce does habitually so that his food stays warmer longer). He doesn’t say a word—too early for Bruce to be speaking, another habit of his and, God, how Tony’s missed him—but he does rest a hand squarely on top of Tony’s head for a moment, like some weird prolonged pat.
“Yeah, alright,” Tony says, talking over him just to make him stop that line of thought. “But I’m fine, kid. And you’re fine?”
“I know,” she says back, grinning. “And I’ll hold you to that.” She squeezes his bicep briefly. “Pass on my message to Steve, ’kay?”
The next thing he knows, Vision is kneeling in front of him and his chest is on fire, the flames licking up his neck and down his arms. His breath wheezes in his throat and he can see Wanda beyond Vision’s shoulder, colorless without the makeup she wears during the day like she hasn’t been getting enough sun. Has she always been this pale? Tony can’t remember.
“Maybe you have a right to information regarding your team,” she says, “but as Tony’s friend, I’m telling you to back off. When it becomes necessary, you’ll know.”
“So it’s a way to prove ourselves,” Vision suggests, and gods help him, Tony knows he thinks he’s helping, that he’s offering a way to frame it less as Tony-thinks-we’re-batshit-and-need-psychoanalyzing and more this-is-something-we-have-to-do-for-everyone-else’s-sakes.
“Hi,” Steve says to her. He looks back down at Tony, more awake than before, but only by a bit. “Sleep okay?”
“Define ‘infected,’” Steve says. There’s a beat of silence, and then another. “Scarlet Witch, report.”
Overall, they talk for hours. By the time they start walking back to the ATV, the sun’s coming at them from a sharp angle. Tony’s both drained and pleased, and he feels like the cat that got the canary the whole ride back to the garage. Steve looks like he feels much the same, a smug-happy smile on his face as he cuts the engine and swings his way to his feet.
He picks up a tablet after that, and checks in on some things, takes inventory of others. He’s not going to be able to do much of anything until he makes a to-do list, figures out his priorities. There are a couple backup armors here at the compound, but he’s down one fully functioning suit now, and that never sits right with him. He doesn’t think he’ll have to scrap it completely, but he won’t know until it’s opened up in front of him. And he’s going to have to send out a memo to the team, he thinks, have them run diagnostics and checks on their own equipment so he can start getting that fixed. Most of them are pretty self-sufficient with their own gear, but there’s got to be at least a couple things that need replacing after that battle.
“We’re taking breakfast requests,” he says. Thor hums and regards them again before picking up his book and looking back down.
The longer they stay online, the better they get at coordinating with one another, too. A couple have managed to stay in the game for nearly the entire time, and they’re getting to be a problem.
Steve walks through the living area and is angled like he’s going to bypass the kitchen too, so Tony reaches out and grabs the back of his suit jacket. Steve pauses, so Tony tugs firmly, and Steve turns. Tony lets go and steps back.
“T’n,” Steve calls, and Tony’s heart clenches. His entire body tenses, and the hand on his shoulder tightens its grip too. It’s Clint, he realizes, and takes a deep breath. Wanda’s watching them intently from a couple yards away, and Thor’s talking to Natasha and some nameless agent a few yards beyond that.
“Fair,” Tony says. He might’ve pushed if they’d been international, but the domestic incidents aren’t really the UN’s business as much as it is their own government’s. They really only do the UN debriefs with their liaison to avoid Ross, and a writeup sounds good enough to him.
“We won’t have any more problems?” Steve asks. Thor meets the queen’s eyes briefly before looking back to Steve and shaking his head. Steve could scream, really. All of this, the bloodshed and death and horror, and they’re just going to leave? Not that he wants them to stay, but why even start this crusade in the first place if they’re just going to give up?
He ends up with a routine pretty quickly. That first week is spent emailing Scott, texting Sam, and starting to get FRIDAY set up. It’s not hard but it is time consuming since none of the hardware is installed yet. He’s doing it right this time around too, which means prepping all the rooms and setting up the servers before switching her on. Normally, the first thing he does in a new space is make some room for his AI. This time around, he—well, technically, he’s doing the same thing he always has, just slower. He’s tired of talking, of finding new ways to say what he means, and he knows that has nothing to do with FRIDAY, knows she understands him better than most, so he is working on getting her space in the new Malibu house, but just. Slowly.
He pushes down the feeling of unfairness that tries making its way up his throat. It’s not fair, or right. Bucky didn’t do those things, he didn’t kill Howard and his innocent wife, and it’s a special kind of torture that they could make his body do it and make him remember, when he held no intention or will to do it himself.
Tony’s mouth snaps shut because he remembers a nightmare, he remembers ending up crouched on the ground with Vision’s arms around him, clinging, and he remembers not being able to remember if it was real. Now, hearing Steve’s voice, he thinks it must’ve happened.
Bruce just stares at him for a moment, an amused tilt to his mouth that’s basically a laugh coming from him. Tony flaps a hand in his direction and gets up off the bed.
“Bump it down to thirty, Fri,” he says again, and he’s already scrolling through the rest of the percentages.
“Whaddaya mean you—” Steve starts to say, and Tony interrupts because he can’t let Steve finish that sentence, he can’t, because he’s looking at Tony like Tony’s as dumb as he feels.
People started filing in then, quietly, like they were afraid to spook him, and Tony realized two things with a jolt: 1) this was the most vulnerable he’d been around the Avengers in a while, definitely since they regrouped from the civil war, and 2) he was embarrassed, bordering on humiliated, and it was lurking just under the surface, getting closer now that he was pretty sure he wasn’t going to die in the immediate future. Oh well, he told himself sternly. Shy wasn’t a good look on him.
sounds from the glass dish they’re throwing his back debris into. When he turns forwards again, Bucky’s rolling his eyes. “Not that.”
Tony really honestly doesn’t know what to do with that. For most of his life, the majority of people who hurt him either didn’t give a shit about him or hated him entirely. That’s easy to deal with, whether it be reporters, business rivals, models who want their fifteen minutes of fame, leaders of terrorist organizations. This is different because Steve cares, Steve cares and he messed up anyway, he hurt Tony anyway, and Tony wasn’t ready for it.
The trick with Rhodey is that you don’t even need to get him drunk to cut loose with him, you just need to hand him a glass bottle and he’ll act like he’s a little drunk. It’s a game of association—make Rhodey feel simultaneously safe and wild, and his tongue will loosen up, and they’ll eventually be sitting on top of one another if there aren’t any women present. It’s nice. This is the trick that makes sobriety work for him. Forget all the sparkling apple juice in champagne flutes and having something to do with his hands, if bottles of soda didn’t play mind games with Rhodes, he wouldn’t even bother.
“Hey,” he says, “so I know you’re not an Avenger right now—friendly neighborhood Spider-Man and whatnot, but you still get a seat at the table, here. We’re having a meeting up at the compound on Friday if you have the time after school.”
“Morning, Rogers,” Natasha says, smirking when Steve’s eyes fly open and land on her, taking in the scene.
Rogers?” Tony asks, reaching over him for the tissues. He makes a show of balling it up and taking aim, lining his elbow up and squinting one eye shut, tongue poking out the side of his mouth in concentration.
“SHIELD wasn’t perfect for obvious reasons,” Natasha adds, sounding so much more like herself. “Distinct lack of vacation days, too. But the dental plans were killer and the psychologists were good at what they did.”
“Right,” Tony says, and he sounds fully back in sarcastic mode. “For that to happen I think we need a threat I can’t handle on my own.”
“I know.” Vision lifts one of the fingers resting on Tony’s back and taps it two, three, four times, almost like he’s patting Tony’s back, but not quite. “Is there anything you need?”
thank u @ anyone still sticking with me on this fic! y'all blow my mind. comments always always always appreciated!
“Falcon, make your way up to the Quinjet,” he says. “We’ll wait for you. Vision, Thor, Wanda, Scott. Stay behind with T’Challa to get those things off-world. We’ll see you in a bit.”
“Just hold on,” Tony says. He feels strangely calm. Steve's the one that needs to stay calm, though. It’s got to be hard for him to breathe with all the debris billowing around them, through the space in between them. Tony has filters in his suit for this, all Steve has between him and the rubble is Tony’s armored body, which is hardly airtight.
“You are,” Tony says confidently, and lowers himself to an elbow again, right by Steve’s shoulder. Steve’s eyes follow him, his head rolling with the movement, looking scared. Tony leans in and presses their foreheads together. “You’re okay; I’m okay. Actually, I’m a little more than okay, mayhaps.”
“Now,” Bruce says before Tony can continue them on that track of conversation, “if you’re gonna be here, you might as well be useful. Go grab me the next dish from shelf B-5.”
“I’d actually rather just not puke at all, but thanks.” When he tests the lid on the water bottle, it gives slight resistance. Sealed. He opens it fully and pours some into his mouth, swishing, and turning to spit into the tub behind him. Come to think of it, the banana’s “sealed” too. Not that he doesn’t think Natasha couldn’t tamper with a banana, but she could just as easily tamper with a sealed bottle of water. Either both are safe or he can’t trust either, and he’s thirsty, so that solves that hangup. He takes a sip and Natasha’s foot bumps into his leg.
Steve’s still frowning, though, and his eyes dart around the workshop before settling to the left. He starts walking so determinedly and so quickly that Tony’s system gets another tiny shock of adrenaline. He tracks Steve across the room to a cabinet where he pulls out the first aid kit and starts walking toward the cot.
There’s some more silence after that, or near silence anyway—two bats fluttering around outside the window, the quiet whirring of the cable box, Sam’s breathing, actually calming now instead of being wrangled into submission—and Tony starts wishing he hadn’t tossed the tablet, just for something to do with his hands. He fidgets instead, starts tapping at his sternum, comforted by the solid
to realize the meaning behind the stimulus, that he and Steve both slept crammed onto the sofa all night long, that Steve stayed and is still here. The warmth making a home in Tony’s chest grows roots, attaching him to Steve and the couch, pinning him down with utter contentment, making him leaden so that he feels like he might never move, might never find a good enough reason to get up and walk away from this morning.
And, sure, he could fiddle with the thing forever, but any more edits or additions he makes are going to be ultimately useless until he can get Barnes down here and fitted with the damn thing.
He had a third realization too, that he was still being effectively cradled by Steve, but at that point it was more of a resigned feeling than a jolt. When he shifted again, Steve loosened his grip so Tony could move, and he only twisted around so he was half sitting on Steve and half sitting next to him on the chair and facing forward. He squinted immediately.
“Latverian design, in the robotics and the clothing,” Tony pants, firing a repulsor. “And they keep mentioning Doom. I thought they meant the concept, but it’s the name—”
“Hey, Fri, baby, let’s bring up that coolant system for a sec,” Tony says, and a hologram pops up over the coffee table. “Fantastic. What is it we’re using now?”
“Right,” Natasha says, and she sounds like herself now, if tired. After a moment, when it becomes clear that most people in the room are too shamefaced to speak in the wake of Rhodey, she continues, “It’s about teamwork and accepting responsibility for yourself. Even if most of us could be persuaded to opt for therapy, all it takes is one stubborn asshole not and flying off the handle to ruin the months and
“Right," Steve says. He closes his eyes, slows his breathing. “Let me just—realign my entire world. One sec.”
Steve’s torso-deep in the fridge, probably looking for something specific that’s already been eaten, when he speaks again.
“Tony, you and I are both men of great passions, but we are also both men of great burdens. You could no more abandon your duty than I.”
4. The last thing he wants is an emergency clause to satisfy his sense of duty. If they see street-level crime or a situation where there’s no time to alert the committee and wait for a decision, they should be able to step in and do their jobs. (Tony doesn’t know how to make this one work, but he sends back something that sounds like a broadly worded self-defense statute—
“Yeah, I know, I know,” Peter says. There’s a brief silence then, the heavy kind, and Tony knows he can just wait it out. Peter’s like Tony was at his age, all movement and words and brilliance. The kind of energy that doesn’t mesh with quiet.
It takes him a long moment to respond, but he reasons with himself that Steve is really trying here. He’s really putting himself out there, willing to hear Tony out in ways that might matter. Ways that might help.
“Wilson pointed me this way,” Bucky says, looking slowly from Steve to Bruce in slow, sweeping motions. Threat assessment or checking them for injuries. Knowing the way Bucky is now, it’s probably both. “The way he said it, though, I expected you to be laid out or somethin’.”
“Code recognized,” FRIDAY says. Steve actually does puke a little in his mouth then, and Clint gives a low, impressed whistle.
This is—the opposite. Only a few seconds pass before Sam walks by, leaving a full box of Margherita in his hands with a comment about ‘babysitting payment’ on his way to sit with Clint and Vision.
There’s a pause during which Tony knows his message is being relayed—if Bucky were particularly busy, FRIDAY would have just told him so—and he picks up a thin wrench to flip around his fingers like a drumstick.
“Thanks,” Tony says, and he has no idea what Rhodey’s referring to. “Experimental regenerative viruses’ll do that for you. Sometimes. When they’re not turning you into human fireworks.”
“That's what you get for letting your guard down,” Tony says, hands spread in a what-can-you-do gesture.
“I know you know,” Tony says, exasperated. “You know, I know, Nat knows, apparently Bruce and Pep know. Everyone knows except him. He’s gonna stomp me out without even knowing it.”
Tony’s smile melts into something a little more genuine and he swings on the couch so he can kick his legs up too.
“They’re live-streaming,” Clint says when all that comes over the line is harsh breathing for a few seconds too long.
“I’ve got a dozen and a half at 57th and 7th,” he says over the comm channel. “This seems to be all, but don’t count on it.”
“Thank you, T’Challa,” Steve says, and they’re wheeling Tony down the alley now, so Steve starts making his way toward the building they landed on. “Avengers, list off.”
This one, obviously, is his fault. He practically catapulted himself into Steve’s office, spitting angry and solidly in fight-or-flight mode over, essentially, old hurts. Even though one could argue that between Steve being a fugitive of the law for a number of months and then Tony’s own obsessive avoidance tactics, the hurts never really healed right the first time around.
He stayed more or less like that until a shrill, heart-wrenching scream came from the stupidly realistic surround sound, louder than the entire movie had been thus far, and Tony thought, nonsensically, oh man, this is it, time to die. Everything pushed at him at once, every sound, the lights of the television, the small amount from the window even though it was night, the noise of breathing, the atmospheric pressure of people breathing around him, shifting, the magnetic fields of electronics and humming of lights, all of it pulsed harshly like a sledgehammer to his skull, his bones, his brain. He knew he had to be imagining about half of that shit, too, but he felt, just…everything all at once, so much, too much, everything—
It’s quiet for a few long moments. The crickets’ chirping is audible even all the way from the compound’s roof.
“Whoa,” Tony says. “Cool it, ’kay? We had it under control. School’s important. You can’t just skip class because a foreign dignitary’s pitching a fit.”
“I’m not the one who left,” he says eventually, the first hints of bitterness in his voice (and that, Steve thinks, is the impressive part, that it took so long).
More than that, they’ve gotten into a contest of sorts. Pretty early on they started trading stories from “the good ol’ days,” meaning pre-prison for Scott and pre-Iron Man for Tony, and each man asserts that he got up to the craziest hijinks. They still haven’t resolved that particular issue, but Tony has decided that it would be a grand time to get Scott into a fully stocked workshop. If nothing else, they’d make some pretty fantastic explosions.
It hammers home the reality Steve’s living in more than his waking words or gestures probably ever could. Even confused and afraid and tense and not-entirely-aware, Steve had quieted instantly as he woke and took in Tony’s reassurance.
“I don’t know,” Tony says. And then he’s running his mouth, and he doesn’t know he’s going to say it until he’s saying, “Listen? Let me talk and ignore me? Stay the fuck away from me? Be there?”
“Guess this is a raincheck on that coffee, huh,” Tony says, going for lighthearted and not quite managing.
“Then we won’t keep you,” Steve says, and he looks at Tony out of the corner of his eye. “It sounds like you’ve got some more practicing to do.”
“Yep,” Tony says, and Bruce barely bothers to open his eyes as he takes the first few stumbling steps following. Tony keeps his arm around the man’s shoulders because, Jesus, he’s going to faceplant if Tony lets go.
“He’ll be fine,” Clint says lowly, finally letting go of Tony’s shoulder. “Asshole’s got a harder head than the rest of us put together.”
Tony grins at that, but it makes a chunk of something slide around between his lip and gums, so he has to lean forward and spit into the toilet.
“Rogers called me, actually.” Rhodey makes his way over the the couch and drops down to Tony’s level, balancing on the balls of his feet. “So I’ve been laying with the dogs all day.”
Tony’s gotten so sucked into the conversation before him he’d almost forgotten about leaving Steve in the elevator. Almost, but not quite—so when Steve walks out and Natasha collapses sideways on the couch, feet kicked into the air, Tony just waves Steve over and looks back at Scott for him to continue. Bruce looks at Steve and back at Tony, an air of doneness about him that Tony appreciates greatly. Scott looks at Natasha, at Steve, and back at Tony who’s waiting for him to continue, and narrows his eyes as his jaw snaps shut.
“Tony, please,” Bruce says, and Tony can’t tell if it’s amused, or fond, or what, but it at least doesn’t seem like he’s going to Hulk out in his shiny new lab quite yet.
After another couple hours, people start filtering out. Sam, Scott, Bruce, Vision, Bucky. Eventually it’s Tony and Steve leaning against the kitchen counter talking to Nat and Clint, who are seated on the couch, Nat’s legs sprawled over Clint’s lap, and Wanda and Thor in the corner, having a conversation together.
“I—” Tony snaps his mouth shut. Distrust flares up his spine, makes his shoulders hike up. He goes for a smile, but all Steve does is return it. He’s not sure what he’s supposed to do with
He thinks he might be at the point in healing where he’s past being bitter and angry and ready to snap all the time. Everything seems normal and calm and better for the most part, and then reminders jump out of the water and he’s blinded with it. They’ve shown (some more than others) that they’re willing to stand beside him, that they’re on the same team, that they care. Which makes things simply confusing. Why did they go through all of that if it was pointless and they’re back anyway? Why the assumptions and the knee-jerk anger and the distrust?
“I’m really not sure if I'm the Jesus in this scenario," Bucky says after a stretched, awkward silence. “What with you—restoring the lost limbs of the leper and whatever.”
“Dude,” Rhodey says. “He was in the Army. In the 40s. And technically he’s part of the generation that raised the Baby Boomers.”
He says goodbye to Happy, makes a tentative promise to get down to the city next week sometime, and when he turns back around, Steve and Peter are peering under the hood of the car Tony’d been working on to calm his nerves.
Two kisses, three of them, and Tony can hear with perfect recall the sound Steve’s skull made against the tree, how still he was, how terrible everything had seemed when he was hazy and hurting.
Tony slows himself down, tracing the conversation back. Protection and being in danger, that’s Steve’s point. Not helmets.
“Fantastic,” Tony says, hands splayed before him (because it’s more effective when he uses both his words and his body language, including tone, when telling a kid they’ve done something right). “Way to study.”
“Enough?” Steve says, pure incredulity. “There’s more than enough. Do you really have no concept of how much people normally eat?”
“Gimme a sign here, FRI,” he says eventually, still staring at the mug. There’s a pause where FRIDAY presumably scans the coffee.
In for a penny, Tony thinks. His eyes, impressive though they are now, still haven’t adjusted entirely to the darkness, but he inches his hand forward anyway until his fingertips land on Steve, lower than in his office, right between the gap between the halves of his ribcage. Steve stops breathing momentarily.
True to form, the common floor was a dance of people and light and noise. Tony strode in and sat in a corner of the couch, next to Vision.
“Easy for you to say,” he says under his breath, keeping his head ducked to look blankly at the notes on his tablet. Tony’s curled, tightly coiled, on one of the armchairs in the common area’s living room, and Steve’s standing by the couch. It’s late enough that everyone’s, if not asleep, tucked into corners of the compound, quietly passing the time. “You’re the one they like.”
It takes Steve about ten more minutes to wake, even with the added weight of Tony’s eyes on him. Once he gets going, he wakes up rather quickly, though Tony suspects this is Steve’s version of slow and relaxed, eyes blinking open soon after his breathing loses the unhurried rhythm of sleep. His smile is wide, closed-lipped and goofy when his eyes focus, though Tony thinks that’s maybe the most ridiculous response to waking up to a grown man staring at you intently. Tony smiles back anyway, smaller and more awake but just as fond, because it is rather flattering.
“Okay,” Steve whispers. He takes a deep breath and his hearing normalizes a little. He does it again. “I want someone getting updates from Chicago. Have Vision checking in.” Another breath. When Bruce rolls his sleeve down, he passes Steve’s arm to Bucky and Bucky tugs. He follows.
“Of course it is,” Bruce hisses, leaning forward with his hands braced on the arms of his wheely chair. “It’s Ultron all over again. It’s making your home our base of operations all over again. Sounds an awful lot like control to me.”
Tony knows from the couple of stakeouts they’ve been on together that Steve can be awake and throwing his shield between one breath and the next, so he suspects that the object’s close, but he can’t see it without shifting around. He wonders if it’s under the bed, and then about why he finds that possibility charming.
“Because you’re refusing to listen,” Natasha says, nearly grounds out with such forced calm it reminds Tony of Nick Fury. She’s leaning forward a little in her chair now—a subtle shift on anyone else, but from her it’s broadcasting her thinning patience on the matter. “The US government—not to mention the entirety of the UN—doesn’t have any good faith left for us, for good reason. Getting everyone on this team the mental help they
“Look,” Rhodey says when he’s done with the braces. Steve glances up to see Rhodey staring at him. “The medical team wouldn’t have been able to help him after the venom was introduced. They’re not really helping now except to monitor. The only thing that would’ve happened in Chicago is that you all would have been distracted.”
“Right,” she says, and then starts counting off on her fingers. “Scarlett Witch, you, Vision, uh. Falcon, Daddy.”
Steve laughs, and it’s less bell-like than usual, more sleep-rough. His fingernails scratch lightly at Tony’s scalp. Tony has to pause and seriously consider the possibility that he’s been kidnapped and somehow rigged into an ideal virtual reality by someone looking to dig his most well kept secrets out of his brain. He read a book like that once; it seems almost like the most likely explanation.
“I can’t just not sleep unless you’re there,” Tony says, more venom behind the words than he really means. He’s just so angry—at Zemo, at Natasha, at himself, at Steve. He needs reality to be just one thing again, he can’t stand this.
“This seems more of an Alpha-6 to me,” she tells him. She takes over the suit then, and Tony lets it go without a fight. He slumps and gives into the urge to twitch.
Tony wishes he knew the right thing to do. He wants one of them to show up and tell him what to do. Ultron was a complete failure. If he hadn’t been brought online too soon, maybe it would’ve worked out, but nobody cares about how great Ultron almost was. Vision comes close, he certainly is astounding, but not the shield around the world Tony was going for. Vision’s a person, a being, and that certainly is a miracle, but an entirely different kind. Tony’s getting older, no matter how well he takes care of himself, and he needs a solution, several solutions, he needs to know they’ll be okay. This is only one contingency, a stopgap at best, but it’s all he’s got so far.
And Tony’s floored, because he does get it then. The need to protect—Jesus, that’s their whole job; that’s what they risk their lives for; they all have that instinct. And Tony’s always wanted so desperately to protect the people he loves, to make sure they’re safe.
Clint shrugs as his hand falls to the armrest of his chair, and he’s got one leg kicked up on the edge of the conference table, relaxed as can be.
He’s supposed to have a healing factor now. That’s the main reason Extremis was even part of the AVALON contingency. And he must have one, considering the fact that he’s still alive, and that all of his scars are gone. He’s sure, too, that he’ll find out soon enough. But…
“Thanks for that input, Dr. Banner,” Rhodey says, swiftly and seriously. “You can screw off now, or I’ll show you just how nice these new legs can be.”
“I mean that shit move from yesterday, diving into combat, alone,” Steve says, and he leaves some space between them, stopping and leaning his hip against a workbench.
“It’s engaging,” Tony says. “And quite honestly it’s refreshing to see that some people have even worse communication skills than we do.”
“It’s…okay,” Tony says cautiously, thinking back to finding Bucky last night. “I’m still—it’s strange to be around everyone all at once. But one-on-one I think I’m solid with almost everyone.”
An insistent knocking at the door snaps him back to reality. Tony raises an eyebrow at his reflection.
“You knew about this?” Steve says, and it comes out much angrier than he probably means it, but this whole experience is grating Steve down to his bones. Tony had been in so much pain, just lying in a back alley on the dirty ground, close to choking on his own vomit, alone. Bruce takes a step, a widening of his feet that’s moving neither forwards nor backwards.
“We’ll be discussing bonding night activities, so come with options ready,” Steve says with a straight face. Clint snorts and Sam groans, while Vision looks to be contemplating the topic with something alarmingly close to sincerity. Before he can open his vibranium mouth, Tony jumps back in.
There’s a humming sounds that kicks in then, and Tony cocks his head. His first thought is that it’s Steve’s phone, but the timbre is off and Steve doesn’t move to pick it up. The sound doesn’t seem to be coming from Tony’s own bedroom or bathroom behind him, and so he reaches out with his senses, out and around—down? It’s coming from below them, maybe, probably, and it sounds like—
“Simple, really,” Steve says. “We commit to talking to each other, and listening. And you start hanging out with the team more, at least on bonding nights once we get that going, so you can see—or we can both see—what happens when we’re not alone.”
The armor puts itself back in the display case and powers down, and both Rhodey and Tony watch until the eyes and reactor go dark.
There’s no need to hurry. He’s not on the clock with this project, it’s not designed to keep him or anyone else alive. It’s extraneous but the kind of task Howard would’ve called “good, honest work.” Tony really must be getting old because he enjoys the pace, finds it comforting.
There’s a whole entire world that needs to be explored or at the very least seen, but Tony’s always been good at fixation. He narrows his world down to this one room, to Steve at his back, and zooms in on the mini reality of them, Steve-and-Tony. It feels safe here, and natural to contemplate. During the day he might distract himself or become convinced it’s all doomed, but right here and now there’s no room for confusion. Time’s frozen with them on the same page and Tony will gladly lie awake all night, Steve’s hand in his, if only time will stay frozen and them okay.
“Results of experiments are only given any sort of scientific validity after repeated trials,” he says instead. “Under varying conditions, of course, to make sure the results aren’t stemming from an altogether unrelated variable.”
and another thanks to everyone leaving comments and still following this story! it's all very dear to me
“And, yeah, I’m willing to accept that the kind of person who’s doing that is maybe not in the best place emotionally, which all brings us very neatly back to my original question.”
“What’s going on?” Tony asks again. He plants his feet wider and thinks of the suit down in the workshop. Steve sidesteps him and is suddenly inside.
Logically, Tony’s pretty sure he won’t. But the idea doesn’t sink in with any conviction. Steve’s shown him depth of feeling when they’re alone, isolated from everyone else. He doesn’t know what Steve’s going to do when they butt heads, or when Tony doesn’t agree with him implicitly and automatically. He doesn’t know what’s going to happen in the real world, outside of this strange, terrifyingly intimate bubble they’ve been building around themselves.
Sam joins them after a while, complaining about what an entire asshole Bucky is, and he doesn’t seem to be judging Tony either, even when he has a second beer. He catches Nat looking at him, but she looks away just as quickly so he doesn’t have time to process her expression.
There’s a moment of absolute stillness, leaden with awkward anticipation, so foreign and strange yet safe that Tony has to appreciate it. Here he is, laying in Steve’s bed, having early-night conversations in a dome of privacy and darkness—and he honestly has butterflies in his stomach. It’s a pure, clean feeling, opposite the chaotic way reality split earlier.
“Nobody’s keeping you here,” Tony says before he’s really thought about it. Part of him, a corner somewhere in his brain, can’t help but feel somehow proud of Bruce for speaking up, even through the inconvenience of it. Most of him, though, thinks,
Rhodey nods, but he’s not looking at Steve. It’s more like he’s nodding to himself, over the entire situation. He does look at Steve then, and then at Bucky, fleetingly, before looking back at Steve, eyes narrowed. Steve clenches his jaw.
“Still better than the meetings,” he says. “Those things make me nostalgic for SHIELD, which is a feeling I actively avoid.”
They settle into a silence that’s only mostly awkward, and Tony turns to his food and focuses on pretending that it doesn’t bother him at all. He’s halfway through his second slice when Bucky talks again.
now. Nothing to do but forge ahead, he supposes. Steve’s feet are planted firmly on the ground, though he stays sitting for now. His posture is challenging nonetheless. Tony lets go of the doorframe and stands with his shoulders back, feet exactly shoulder-width apart.
“This doesn’t even matter anymore,” Tony mutters eventually. Then, louder, “This is in the past—Steve, this isn’t going to fix anything now.”
Or worse. But Tony doesn’t say that either. He’s at peace with his anger during that time, and it was well-documented. But the sadness, the sense of abandonment, the tears that weighed him to his bed on those days when he felt like giving up, those are another beast entirely. He thinks everybody probably knows—he knows he’s not a huge mystery—but that doesn’t mean he has to admit to it.
That isn't, strictly speaking, ideal. There are some non-original members of the team—Sam and Rhodey, maybe even Scott—that Tony thinks deserve to get turns as acting chairperson, but this was an easier line to draw, more natural and less exclusionary. Besides, Rhodey’s still a military man, technically, and busy more often than not.
“Hello?” Steve’s voice calls, but Tony can hear someone moving toward the door already, so he doesn’t bother trying to think of a reply. He only has to wait a handful of seconds before Steve opens the door. He looks politely confused, head cocked to the side like a damn golden retriever, but at least he doesn’t look like he was just asleep.
“Thanks,” Tony doesn’t say, though he does slide one of his hands up inside Steve’s shirt to run his fingers over the ridges of his abs, which he thinks is at least similar.
“Rogers…” He’s wary of this, of Steve, helping, pretending nothing’s wrong, but he doesn’t know what the fuck he’s supposed to say, and neither does Steve.
He’s tempted to do a few things at this very moment, including, but not limited to: texting Rhodey an SOS; jumping out his bedroom window and letting FRIDAY snatch him up in a suit, taking him very very far away; sinking through the floor, to the simple bliss of no longer existing.
“Hit it then, babycakes,” Tony says, and tries to pretend he remembers which subprotocol Alpha-6 is. FRIDAY probably knows best, though. He trusts his girl.
And—right there. Steve’s gearing up for his Bucky-was-innocent speech. Tony catches Natasha’s eye and she glances quickly to his mic and back. He’s talking before he’s even registered leaning forward.
“Holy role reversal, Batman,” Bruce mutters, watching Tony’s mug through narrowed eyes as the liquid at the bottom gets closer and closer to spilling onto the bench.
He lets the tech speak long enough to explain the test and give instructions before gesturing toward the intercom button himself. The tech shrugs, so Tony leans forward and starts.
he thinks, a little hysterically. It’s the same code from before the Accords, before Siberia. And Tony hasn’t changed it. But that’s…something to look at later. Not now.
And, okay, maybe Tony doesn’t know, not exactly. Usually he can get a vague idea of what the bots mean, especially DUM-E, but mostly FRIDAY will send the cliffnotes version to his phone later in case the bot actually has information he’d really like to relay.
“What the fuck,” he whispers and hesitantly (suspiciously) reaches for a plate, watching them out of the corner of his eye as they all watch him slowly reach for the sausage.
IMPORTANT NOTE: cw for self-harm at the beginning of this chapter. nothing major, but be aware please and thank you
Steve’s standing there next to Sam and he’s taking in the scene before him, for lack of a better way to put it. And then he’s smiling, he’s beaming, and obviously tying to tamp it down. Sam goes to get them both water bottles out of the fridge. Meanwhile, Steve grabs onto both ends of the towel around his neck and Tony doesn’t know what he’s supposed to do. Before he’s figured it out all the way, Bucky starts to stir, stretching his legs out straight and yawning, opening his eyes. The silence between Steve and Tony refreshes as Bucky looks around, becoming a three-way awkwardness, and Tony looks down at his tablet. And dammit, he’s lost his train of thought entirely.
“The only two that count,” Sam says, but it doesn’t fool anyone. Clint has the best eyes—they don’t call him Hawkeye for no reason—and even with Sam and Tony in the sky, it’s a loss. Sam and Tony are flyers, and Tony’s one of the heaviest hitters here. They call out what they can, but they also fly low to fight their own share of the aliens.
“Just—throw those out, start over,” Clint says, gesturing wildly toward a bowl of something. “You’re not gonna get all the shells out like that and I, personally, am not eating anything you make with those eggs.”
“You’re not!” Tony says, feeling more than a little desperate. “You’re not responsible for my bullshit, Rogers. The only thing you’re responsible for is yourself.” He takes a step forward, and then two backwards, and then he slams his hand palm-down on the countertop. “Fuck’s sake!”
He goes through The Routine, puts on some clean jeans and a couple t-shirts (purposefully leaving the tinted HUD glasses behind, knowing they can come off as defensive just like regular sunglasses), and, before he can talk himself out of it, walks down the hall to Steve’s room. It’s not until after he knocks that he realizes Steve’s probably not just sitting in his room, but the door swings open to reveal Steve in dark jeans and a dark gray shirt with three-quarter sleeves, a style that looks unfairly good on him and one that Tony’s sure Wanda introduced him to. Steve’s sense of style increased by roughly 70% when she joined the team, though she still can’t convince him to accessorize, much to Natasha’s amusement. Tony grins wide, and Steve blinks at him.
“I’m gonna go downstairs now,” Tony says. Steve blinks at him and Tony turns to look at Steve’s hand where it’s somehow still touching him, though it’s slid down to rest against Tony’s bicep.
There’s a woman sitting two tables in front of Tony, pretty young, fried bleached hair, and a large coffee cup and notebook on her table amongst the books—seven of them. There’s another thermos of coffee sticking out of her backpack. She’s writing with four different kinds of pens, switching back and forth rapidly. He swears he can just about smell the bitterness of ground up Ritalin from here, but he thinks that might be his brain filling in the blanks a little bit.
“There’s a video somewhere,” Steve says, and laughs, even if it sounds a little breathless. “That was Stark’s present, a montage video of their mad dash to find presents for me. He even got security footage from some of the stores they went to, sweating their balls off in the middle of July in Manhattan.”
“Well,” Sam says, and looks off to the side. More considering than chastised, but whatever. “Now that you mention it, I mean, no. Guess I assumed that was something the ‘senior members’ took care of.”
thank you TREMENDOUSLY to anyone who's still reading (or to anyone who's just found this fic for the first time). i believe we're nearing the end here, and i'm so very bad at endings, but i've been writing this for too long to simply abandon it, and i couldn't let myself do that to y'all. so, even if it's taking a while, thank you so so much for bearing with me, and i hope you all enjoyed this chapter.
“I’m a goddess,” she tells them. Tony smiles. “Bow down to the mighty powers of the diplomat extraordinaire.”
And then it’s gone, in a sweep of red, and that must’ve been Wanda, but it’s Sam who’s standing above them now, reaching down.
Vision and Wanda have moved on to evacuation, methodically making the rounds through the surrounding buildings. Natasha’s rejoined the guys on the ground, and she’s  being tight-lipped about the injured woman. Nobody asks a second time.
Tony had absolutely no idea how long they sat there like that. His perception of time was tentative on the best of days, and he was twisted in knots tonight. Maybe he nodded off for a couple minutes. One moment his head was radiating pain, and the next it'd ebbed considerably. He shifted, just a stretch of muscles, and he felt raw, but not like his body and brain were screaming.
The realization hits him eventually. First, it’s the sound: the ping of a tablet sending a message gets his attention, but it’s a short, staccato noise, and it’s gone quickly enough that Tony’s attention hasn’t yet faded, so he hears the incessant beep-beep-beeping underneath it all. It takes him a few seconds too long to place it as medical equipment, but what else could it be?
“Okay, you’re still alive, or okay, people can come back now?” Steve sounded like he was smiling again.
He pauses as the weight of that hangs in the small amount of air still between them, and Steve grip tightens almost imperceptibly on his head. Tony’s suddenly uncomfortably aware of how fragile human skulls are, and how incredibly strong Steve is. The patch of Steve’s shirt he’s talking into is vaguely damp with his breaths, but he doesn’t much care.
“How could I have gotten you out?” Tony says, raising his voice to match hers and cursing himself as he does it. It’s not that he doesn’t think he has a right to be angry—he well and truly believes he’s entitled to his share of bitterness here—but more just that he wants to live, and yelling at Wanda is not a good way to ensure his own continued safety. But
Steve’s other hand comes up to Tony’s throat, his thumb barely brushing Tony’s jaw, and the message is a clear
There’s a second, two, where nobody says anything. Wanda opens her mouth like she’s going to argue, but Tony’s still wrapped up nice and tight in alien tentacles, thank you very much, and he does not have time for this.
Part of Tony wants to laugh, point out that he wasn’t asking. The rest of him is too busy sighing in relief.
Steve gets close enough to Thor and the Hulk that his comm starts picking up what they’re saying and transmitting it to the rest.
It’s around 5 AM the next morning when Steve gets a video message (and he’s honestly surprised that it’s a feature on this phone). It’s DUM-E wearing a dunce hat that’s been painted with stripes to look like a birthday hat, and he’s holding a sparkler and spinning in circles. The caption reads “the little shit misses you, come home soon.”
finals are over, i drove for about four days to get to my parents' house, went to visit family in NM for a week, got back to my parents' house around 1am yesterday, and here i am again. here's to hoping the next chapter doesn't take me an entire goddamn month
“At first I really just felt…cheated. We were finally going to try and talk things out, so of course the universe would drag us over the coals when we’re finally close to getting on the same page.”
“Most of my teeth are fake,” Clint agrees with a quick grin to show them off. “And most people can’t even tell.”
“Restrictions lifted,” FRIDAY says. “Would you like to see a log of attempted communications during the restricted period?”
“There are lists of therapists to choose from in your files,” Tony says into the somber room. He feels like he’s reading out someone’s last will and testament, and the ridiculousness of it is the only thing keeping his voice steady. That, and probably Extremis somehow.
“Okay,” Natasha said. “We can just be quiet. Talk a little?” Tony hummed at her. He’d been having a good time before things got excessive. Maybe she’d noticed.
“Three nights,” Tony supplies. “Or four, counting tonight, which we should because it’s over halfway done and
The sight of Steve catches Tony’s attention from the corner of his eye. Still, very still, and staring unblinking at the floor. He doesn’t exactly look tired, but Tony suspects anyway. When he nudges Steve’s foot with his own, the man’s focus flickers to Tony immediately.
Come on, Stark, you can do better than that. “Things are—better, I’m coming to find, when we work together instead of against each other all the time. But it’s. Not more important, per se, but, I. Also enjoy it when we’re friends outside of what that may or may not mean to the overall security and safety of the world and the human race.”
The universe rewards him. When he gets to the kitchen, there’s already coffee in the pot. Tony notices the other people in the room, but ignores them to have a stare down with the coffee pot.
The look Steve gives him makes him want to take them back, stuff the words back down his throat where they’ve lived for years now.
Round Table discussion is what they’re calling the setup of this meeting, and it is. Everyone’s sitting down at least, even Tony and Steve, who are stationed at opposite heads of the table.
“You were welcomed into the compound and onto the team, no questions asked,” he says. “Your goal for years prior to that was revenge on Tony, and nothing really happened to change that. At best, you proved you weren’t willing to let the world burn to get your payback, and yet.”
Tony can feel the tech’s eyes on him and knows they’ll pitch a fit if he tries to explain how the CT radiation really isn’t a problem for him, he really could just chill in here while they do the scan. All they need of Steve is his head, anyway, the rest of his body doesn’t even need to go through the scanner.
Tony does something he tries not to do these days: he assumes. And he’s assuming that nobody got an eye taken out by shrapnel, or Clint would’ve mentioned it.
“Would you like to discuss this privately?” Bruce asks. Pepper’s shoulders rise and fall hard in a deep, shuddery breath. When she speaks, though, her voice is considerably more composed.
“What do I need?” Tony asks, and he picks up the pace to a normal cadence. Surefire, quippy. “I’m not sure who you think I am, Captain, but I’ve already got more than enough—”
More of the infected human-alien hybrids start showing up after that. So much for protecting Wanda, Tony thinks.
He calms down and works himself up at the same time. The breathing and stillness staves off the reactionary panic to feelings and honesty and transparency, but the time to think settles the weight of their changing dynamic down on top of him. He makes it about twenty minutes—a miraculous feat, really—before carefully, slowly extracting himself from Steve’s bed. He grabs his phone and tiptoes to the ensuite, moving as soundlessly as he can, closing himself in but leaving the light off. It’s not like he strictly needs it to see. (It’s not strictly like he can’t see, even in the near pitch blackness anyway.)
Three hours later he and Sam are watching French TV, but it’s muted and they’re filling in the dialogue with their own ridiculous version. It’s something Bucky used to do while waiting for a shot when he was too far away to hear, and the memory makes something twist in Steve’s gut. He squashes it, reminds himself that Bucky’s safe with T’Challa, frozen and probably waiting for Steve and Tony to get their shit together or for the world to start ending again.
“Just a little longer, right?” he says to them. He’s fighting a losing battle, and not against the Brood. No matter how hard he tries, he’s losing consciousness. Probably more than consciousness. Steve looks like he wants to cry. Wanda’s stepped away from them and is holding more Brood off while they have their moment.
There’s almost an entire ten seconds of silence as Steve takes tiny sips and Clint watches the both of them.
Belatedly, he realizes he’s been staring at Steve for minutes now, blinking slowly, and Steve’s been returning his gaze. The edge has bled out of the moment, leaving calm regard. Expectation.
“Yep,” Rhodey says. “The aliens went back from whence they came, Earth lives to see another day, and everyone has officially regained consciousness.”
“Ruptured somethin’,” Sam says, waving a hand vaguely, but his eyes are sliding shut. “He should be fine.”
“Why should we?” And that’s Wanda, sitting at the kitchen island. Tony moves his gaze to her but keeps his body squared towards Steve. “If they’re just going to let us come back and help when there’s real trouble, why should we stay? Why do we need to deal with the Accords at all?”
“Well, we’ve got his attention now, so he’s either gonna help or make the entire exercise impossible, so he might as well be useful.”
“Hey there, honey bear,” Tony says when the elevator slides open. He flashes a quick grin when Rhodey just looks him up and down critically.
Vision smirks because he really is Tony’s son, deep down (very deep down), and Wanda turns her nose up dramatically.
It’s slow going, but eventually the speed of conversation everyone else is having—pulling him into—slows him down a bit, reassures him.
He can’t shake the thought. The longer he lies here, the more it festers and takes root, until all he can seem to do is conjure up worst case scenario after worst case scenario, each somehow scarier than the last. Scenarios where he kills everyone in the compound, where he takes away Earth’s mightiest heroes, all of them, leaving the planet at the mercy of whatever homicidal maniac strolls along next. At the mercy of himself.
Debrief goes well aside from the mention of Bucky. Steve participates just as much as he did in SHIELD debriefs, everyone is thorough in their recounts, and Mrs. Young is exceptionally diplomatic, asking the nitty gritty questions without sounding condescending and directing the conversation expertly.
So he knows he can’t fuck off to Malibu forever like he wants, can’t just disappear from the world stage no matter how tired he is. At this point, the Avengers are his consequence. A dozen books, countless podcasts, and half the population of the US have uttered the words “since Tony Stark put on that metal suit…” Like it or not, he was a major catalyst for the entire shitstorm of the Avengers Initiative. Not to mention, he funded the Avengers fully after the fall of SHIELD. He held charity fundraisers and employed an entire team of PR gods to ensure people kept their faith in world’s mightiest heroes.
Bruce doesn’t exactly shrink under her gaze, but his shoulders do hunch. He twirls his glasses around by the end for a moment, and then looks up to meet Pepper’s eyes, and then behind her to briefly look at Steve. His eyebrows rise and fall in a gesture that reads to Steve as ‘fuck it.’
“Humble abode,” Bucky echoes with an amused huff. His focus isn’t even on Tony, but the ’shop around them, eyes flitting from bench to bench, pausing on the Iron Man armor in its case before moving on to the rest. Tony realizes all at once that this is Bucky’s first time down here, ever. He’s never seen this part of Tony before. He lets the silence stretch on a few more seconds than he normally would as Bucky takes it in.
“He’s—” Tony says. His heart feels twisted. He tries, for a brief moment, to conjure the hurt from Siberia, the sting from Steve lying to him for years, the feeling of being a negligible variable to Steve, not worth the effort, the sentence that could have brought him peace if Steve had just bothered. The momentary certainty that Steve was going to decapitate him with a weapon forged by Howard’s hands.
“That’s one way to put it,” Tony says. He leans his hip against the island counter and sizes Steve up. He looks…really fucking uncomfortable, actually. His posture is stiff and he’s looking straight into Tony’s eyes like he’s bracing himself.
“Yeah, well,” Tony says, and he’s tense now, too, even though neither of them seem to be on the verge of yelling anymore. Tenser for it, probably. “I don’t actually want to murder any of my friends or coworkers.”
“I think I’ll live, though I might have to crash on the floor.” He tries to laugh, to make that sound more like a joke, but he can’t tell how close he gets to the mark. “That honestly doesn’t even sound like such a hardship at the moment.”
There are so many of them now, Tony can’t help but wonder at as he looks around. They’re in one of the more casual conference rooms—the one with carpet and the plush wheely chairs and a coffee maker on the counter by the wall.
Tony’s jarred out of his mind by Clint, who’s suddenly very very there and taking up his field of vision all at once. Tony starts badly but he recovers quickly. Clint has the decency to look sheepish.
“Colonel Rhodes,” Steve says. He clears his throat and starts again, “It’s good to see you up and about again, though I wish the circumstances were better.”
“We’re all due to debrief with a UN representative in the morning,” Tony says, eyes still locked with T’Challa’s surprisingly understanding ones. “You may have all been pardoned, but the Accords are still in place, and you will follow them. We can talk amendments tomorrow afternoon when debrief is over, or you can crawl back to Wakanda. I don’t give a shit.”
“What he means to say is that he’s building you a new arm,” Sam says. “And what you meant to say, I’m sure, was
Peter’s eyes are wide, and Vision has stopped pretending to breathe, still as a statue as he watches.
Tony isn’t going to say he’s a better person when he and Steve are on the same side because he’s pretty confident in his own moral compass, but—
“It’ll probably save the entire world oodles of crap,” Tony says. “But—yeah. Part of eligibility for active membership should be respect for—or at least a tolerance of, I’m not that picky—all teammates. I don’t know exactly how we’re going to judge that, and doctor-patient confidentiality is still a thing, but we’ll hash something out and see how it works.”
Next is his team, all of them weighted equally. He debated, at first. Wanda’s the youngest (not counting Peter, who’s technically not a teammate), Scott and Clint both have children, Steve is the undying symbol of hope and unity (and he’s
“Mr. Stark?” she asks, oddly hesitant. Tony can’t remember her sounding hesitant before, not even in the thick of the Ultron debacle. He clears his throat and winces.
“Maybe,” Tony told him. Steve gave up and sat in the chair right next to Tony’s couch. The plate of food stayed where it was, and Tony’s headache notched up. The movie started up, then, and Tony learned that Wanda picked this time. He relaxed a tiny bit, the half-formed fear of action movie explosions falling away. People chatted lowly through the previews, and the movie itself had a muted color scheme and soft-spoken characters, but that was about all he could tell. He fazed out of reality for a little while, carried on an overpowering wave of sensation and sensory input that wouldn't let him breathe properly.
It’s not until the third beer that Tony realizes: he’s not even buzzed. He doesn’t feel anything, no warmth in his stomach, no heat on his face, no careful tingling in his fingertips. Nothing.
“Mm-hm,” Tony mumbles, so Steve gets a tupperware container full of leftover Hawaiian pizza and three bottles of purple Gatorade, and brings them back to where Tony’s sitting exactly as Steve left him.
“Tony,” Steve says again, jaw clenched and shoulders square like he’s ready for a fight, and Tony tells himself it’s not a physical fight, calm down a little maybe, “what’s going on?”
“I was…” Tony can actually see the moment Clint realizes how ridiculous this whole thing is, and shakes himself a little. “I need a jet, I need to go home to my family,” he says resolutely, all-in. Tony still respects him. He thinks the others might be watching from where they’re all sitting around in the living room and kitchen, but he doesn’t look.
He’s broken out of his reverie when a plate of waffles is set at one elbow and a platter of fresh fruit at the other. He twists in his chair, but the kitchen’s still a flurry of activity. There’s no telling who it was that served or made the food, and that…bothers him, more than it rationally should.
“You deserve to be happy,” Bruce says, casually, like he’s talking about the weather, pretending to focus back on his little glass slide even though he doesn’t poke it, and something in Tony crumbles.
“We have time,” Tony says with as much nonchalance as he can conjure, a friendly reminder to the both of them.
They chat for a while longer, about the American incarceration system, frisbee golf, using superheroing as an extracurricular activity. They’re not up for a very long time, though they somehow move through topics in a sincere, rapidfire kind of way lent to the unfiltered thoughts people have in the middle of the night. Soon enough, Sam makes himself some hot chocolate and heads back to his room, telling Tony to get some rest.
Steve’s room feels more like a universe. He can’t fathom the idea of space beyond the walls here, the grounds of the compound, the vastness of the upstate sky, the terrifying reality of space-space beyond that. This, Steve at his back and the blanket over him, the slight hum of the controlled climate keeping the building warm. There’s so much here, an entire landscape. He could stay here all night, wide awake as he is, and not run out of things to experience.
Bucky doesn’t say anything, just stands very, very still. Natasha sighs. He thinks Sam might’ve fallen asleep. Steve steps forwards, aware that his voice is raised, angry, even though he doesn’t want to start a fight right now, not with Rhodey of all people.
“Is this about the fridge again? I’ll have food delivered by morning, I promise. Just, nobody attack the delivery person in the middle of the night.”
And then there’s a plate in front of him, syrup and butter at his elbow. Tony pokes at the french toast with his fork, flips it over, but it smells good at the very least. It might not be cooked very evenly, but it all seems cooked enough. He scoops up his plate and mug and makes a strategic retreat to the table when Cassie starts telling her dad why Sam gets to be gold and why Scott himself should be pink. He sits with his back to the kitchen after going back for the syrup and butter, facing Clint.
Tony runs his mouth the entire time, alternating between explaining the arm’s features and scolding DUM-E. Bucky stays entirely, eerily still and totally quiet. In reality, the adjustments and fitting only take a few minutes at most, and then Tony watches as the plates slide and click into place, almost flawlessly except for a section in the back, behind Bucky’s armpit where the metal plates are small and fold into one another to mimic the range of motion of a normal human arm. Tony breathes around his panic, waiting out every instinct his brain can throw at him, even as he watches Bucky frown and twist, trying to see what the problem is.
“I know, Steve,” she says, squeezes his arm. “Believe me. I do. You need help, though, and it’s Extremis. It’ll take time to…run its course.”
Tony lets Rhodey press him into the pillow, then, even though what he really wants is some breathing room, some space. They’re kind of awfully close. Pepper’s got the right idea, though, except that hurts in a different way. Honestly, she can’t even be within touching distance of his bed?
Steve shuts up, then, and comes closer. Tony turns back to his hologram, though he’s definitely lost concentration. Steve’s behind him, a little to the side, and puts a hand on the junction between Tony’s shoulder and neck, thumb swiping slowly. It feels at odds with the speed at which Tony’s existing. He almost wants to duck out of the contact, but doesn’t want to give Steve the wrong idea, so he takes a deep breath instead, focuses on the graphics in front of them, twisting them, trying to think of weak points, stabilizing factors, the safest way to let them be the biggest idiots about personal safety. A few minutes go by, and Steve watches the light as Tony manipulates it.
Breathe, he orders himself, and does. Eyes closed, he does. He can hear Wanda strumming a guitar down the hall—the new one, the electric, and it’s unplugged, just the quiet twang of unamplified steel, but she’s getting good. Someone’s snoring farther up the hall; it’s Scott, Tony realizes, which makes sense. His sleeping schedule’s gotten all sorts of screwy lately, something about his daughter’s nightmares and late-night FaceTime sessions. Tony should really invite the kid and her mom out for a weekend sometime soon.
The lights come up and Steve’s there, in the workshop, about four meters away, and it’s still too close. Tony isn’t afraid of the man, but he hates the distance between them now. He closes his eyes.
“Yeah.” She picks up her fork and starts in on her salad, pointing at him with the spinach. “He’s on thin ice though, and you should pass on the message.”
Tony wakes early and lies in bed for far longer than he should. He doesn’t feel rested at all. By the time the sun is up, he’s peeling himself out of bed and to his bathroom. If he wants to pretend he’s an adult with any authority today, he’s going to have to look the part. Brush teeth, meds, shower, re-bandage, shave, and makeup for the bruises. The routine hasn’t changed since Afghanistan when he added the injury care and concealer for the ever-present nicks and dings, but it’s been around in some iteration since he took over SI. Tony can forget to sleep, to eat, safe drinking limits, but he doesn’t forget The Routine, ever. Tired as he is, though, he almost chooses to skip over it.
dies on Tony’s tongue before he says it, because he doesn’t want to deal with that right away in the morning (whether he’s actually slept yet or not), and he doesn’t think either Steve or Bruce do either. Vision might but, again, there’s a reason he’s Tony’s favorite.
Tony nods, and she leaves. Steve fell asleep the second he was stationary, and the doctor who settled them said that it was fine, not a danger at all, so Tony’s going to let him. This is certainly better than the hazy pain he was in while awake. So he settles into a plastic chair, texts the rest of the team to let them know which hospital they’re at, and watches to make sure Steve’s breathing evenly, wondering what the hell he would do if the breaths stopped.
“I’m sorry,” Tony whispers, and it feels wrong, like battery acid in the back of his throat, like some combination of
“I do, though.” Steve’s hands are so gentle, so careful. Tony can’t decide if he wants to bury his face in Steve’s hair or choke the life out of him, so he does neither. Steve’s voice is gentle, too, sad. “I’m not going to hurt you.”
“God forbid,” Rhodey says. His smile drops slightly, expression turning thoughtful as he considers Tony.
as in the people Steve has considers his; Steve collects followers and devotees everywhere he goes, but he trusts only a few people.) He remembers Peggy being around the first ten or so years of his life, how strong and sweet and patient she had been. He grew up seeing the reels and hearing the accounts of Barnes, too—how he was efficient, easy, and protective. Steve even managed to inspire some kind of longstanding loyalty in Howard who, for all his flaws in the fatherhood department, was still a good person who dedicated his life to protecting people and making discoveries. Sam is genuine and wickedly smart and sharply sarcastic and takes things at face value. Tony likes him, even though he didn’t know him well before the whole mess with the Accords. He thinks he might be grateful for that, actually. One less betrayal. All he sees when he looks at Sam is a good man who had some serious reservations about handing over his professional autonomy and who’s a good friend, if a little misguided.
Steve makes another distressed sound, a hum, low in his throat but quieter than the other noises. Resigned and tired. They’re not holding hands anymore, but their hands are still touching, Tony’s pinky almost hooked around Steve’s thumb. He chances a slow swipe where they’re already touching, hoping it’ll be interpreted subconsciously as comfort instead of something to panic over.
“I wasn’t the only one, you know. It takes two to fight,” he says quietly. The words are bullshit. Tony’s pretty sure even Steve knows how irrelevant a thing it is to point out at this stage in the game based on his voice; he sounds absolutely dejected, like he’s resigned himself to another screaming match or even another physical fight. Tony looks him square in the eyes when he answers.
The armor peels away and starts flitting around, gathering bits of circuitry from the grass. His heart’s hammering when he turns back to Steve, whose condition hasn’t changed in the slightest. Thor meets his eye from where he’s kneeling by Steve’s head, murmuring what sound like reassurances. Tony reaches out and puts a gentle hand on Steve’s ankle, using so little pressure Steve wouldn’t be able to feel it through the Kevlar even if he were awake.
“Night, guys,” Tony says to the living room. Natasha smiles like she’s in on the biggest joke in history and Clint pulls his beer bottle away from his mouth so he can offer a silent
“No,” Natasha says evenly. “Given the choice, I don’t think half of us would go in for it, and I think that’s part of the problem.”
“I had a helicopter!” He gestures excessively, desperately. “The five of us on a chopper? We never would’ve outrun their aircraft!”
“Boss?” FRIDAY says, and she’s an AI, Tony knows he can’t hear uncertainty in her voice because that’s not the personality he programmed her with, but he thinks she is uncertain; she wasn’t around before Tony was a constant wreck, doesn’t know his usual ways of dealing with bullshit like this. The norm for her is hardly the wider sense of normality Tony knows from life before everything went to hell in a hand basket. “Would you like me to call—”
Steve Rogers is not meant to be hurt. It’s wrong on every level. And this isn’t even about him not being able to see beyond Captain America. Sure, Steve’s human, he gets confused and frustrated and Tony’s seen him sleepy and unguarded, and all of those are preferable to this. Steve indignant and spitting out root beer like the un-American heathen he really is? Of course. Steve, regretful but tight-jawed and ready for a fight, looking Tony in the eyes, admitting to betrayal? Even that, though terrible, is full of life, fire. The stillness and smallness of a hospital bed, the absolute lack of privacy they really get from the curtain—this is wrong.
“I’m always busy,” he throws back, more as a sad imitation of their old verbal sparring than any kind of truth. Steve sighs and gives Tony a once over that makes his skin prickle uncomfortably.
Colors are different now. Enhanced, like everything else. The bluejay is four different shades of blue, and none of them solid. He can see the gradients, the fades and the flaws. It’s less simple, maybe, but more beautiful.
Tony gets it, okay, he gets that this is maybe a sore subject. As someone who made it onto the team by the skin of his teeth—Iron Man, yes; Tony Stark, not recommended—he can sympathize with the flash of fear some people in the room must be feeling. Wanda, for one. Bruce too, probably, with how little self-worth the man carries around.
But even he knows that’s ridiculous. What he really wants was for them to have been ready for this conversation back then. He also knows neither of them were. Tony hadn’t gotten used to Steve being around again yet, and he sure as hell hadn’t trusted him. For his part, Steve didn’t yet understand what Tony was going through, or even quite have a handle on the whole respecting-Tony’s-boundaries thing. It would’ve been an unmitigated disaster, and Tony knows it, but he still can’t help wishing they’d done this sooner anyway. It feels like he’s wasted a lot of time being angry and defensive when he could’ve had this instead.
“That usually depends on what the promise is,” Steve says, but he looks more amused than suspicious. His eyes flick a couple times to different parts of Tony’s body, and Tony can’t quite clearly remember where all of his injuries were—after a while it stops being individual points of pain and blurs together—but he thinks Steve might be cataloguing all the places Tony was hurt. Tony grins, easy peasy, and puts his hands in his pockets.
No, he thinks, rather petulantly. He really doesn’t want to deal with that, not right now. It’s more like falling asleep this time than being pulled under, but he lets it wash over him anyway.
Team Bonding Nights are official. Not mandatory, but highly encouraged. Steve reasons it’s important for everyone to feel like they’ve spent time together outside of combat and high stress situations and, given recent events, Tony doesn’t exactly disagree anymore.
“I’m gonna go catch some shuteye,” Tony says. He can see Natasha’s hair over the back of the couch. “That much serious talk and genuine emotion ruins me for casual banter anyway.”
Not Tony, lying mere feet from a broken beer bottle, gasping like a fish out of water, tear tracks running down his face from every angle, trembling and twisting, gagging in pain.
“I’ll be making amends till the day I die. Actually, if everything works out, I’ll be actively making amends for about twenty years after that too. But I don’t have the time to be kissing ass for the decisions I stand behind.”
“I fell asleep,” Tony explains, but that doesn’t wipe the look from Steve’s face. “It’s not deep,” he tries next, because it’s really not. He’s not sitting down here bleeding out, it doesn’t even need stitches.
“Give me a sign,” Tony says, pleads, hands out to look nonthreatening. “Just gimme a reason not to kill you, that’s all I need.”
It sounds like he’s in pain, a whimper-grunt through gritted teeth, and Tony’s sure he’s never heard something so sad from Steve before. There’s a moment of blind panic where Tony’s sleep-addled brain is convinced that his presence in Steve’s bed is somehow causing physical harm to the man. It takes the jolt of adrenaline springing through his blood and waking him up before the simple reality of the situation hits him: Steve’s having a nightmare.
And, God, she’s as beautiful as always. He saw her right when he woke up, of course, and before she left the compound, but he’d still been reeling a little bit, a little overwhelmed and unable to focus. The noise—the sound-noise, the visual-noise, the smell-noise, the brain-noise—it all falls away when he looks at her now. His magnifying glass, his fixed point, his anchor.
Tony touches down next to Steve for a while; they fight as flawlessly as they ever have despite the haunted look on Steve’s face and the way Tony can’t stop shaking inside the armor, only overlapping adrenaline rushes keeping him upright. They don’t talk beyond strategy, but Tony thinks he can read some of his own conflicting feelings in Steve’s body language; the relief at being a united front again, the horror at having to kill things that used to be people, the trust to have each other’s backs.
“I don’t think I’m sleeping anytime soon, and I’m tired of staring at the wall,” Tony says. Steve takes a visibly deep breath. “Go turn on a Bond movie and I’ll make the popcorn.”
“I stopped talking,” Tony says all in a rush. Steve scoffs again, but with less of an edge this time.
“Man, is this all?” he asks again. Tony narrows his eyes and Sam continues, “Is this all that’s got you so tied in knots for the meeting? It’s all
“A hundred and seventeen countries, Banner. And they were right to be uncomfortable with the level of power we had. They were right to demand change, and they were right to be pissed off. You’re probably right to be pissed off too.”
2. He’s outlined what he thinks constitutes “unlawful detention” (aka the RAFT) and calls for protection of their Fourth Amendment under the US Constitution. The letter indicates that, yes, they understand that the Accords are international law and not subjected to the constitutionality of the United States, but they agree nonetheless that it’s a viable goal if only because of the fiasco of the RAFT and the sympathy of the general population. (Tony agrees, it’s best to strike while the iron’s hot for this one.)
“Ant-Man,” Scott says. “I’m good to stay. Minor injuries, but nothing that needs immediate attention.”
“You look like someone’s dying, Tones,” he says, and Tony can’t quite remember the last time Clint called him by his name, let alone
“Well then,” Tony muses. “Relieved, huh?” He waves toward the armchair—and, consequently, the tablet—like Vana White. “By all means, then, feel free to lead the charge if you’re so—hey, no!” Tony reaches in Sam’s direction half-heartedly as he gets up and retrieves the tablet. The meeting’s contents aren’t a secret, exactly—Steve knows the whole thing inside-out by now, and Clint and Natasha have been helping with therapist selection. And, anyways, trying to be clandestine with all the spies and thieves and government entities in the house is a fool’s errand, he’s not an idiot. It just feels a whole lot like vulnerability, that list, this meeting—despite the number of hours he’s put into it, thinking about what he wants out of it still makes him think of the sun warming his ears, and Steve’s eyes perched up in an apple tree, and familiar, unnamed bird calls. He doesn’t want other people in that memory, doesn’t want Steve seeing it in a new light, maybe. Tony doesn’t want anything to undo the validation he got there.
“SHIELD’s the worst,” Rhodey agrees. “It’s not that I’m glad they’re gone because it was nice when they dealt with the bureaucratic bullshit, but also good riddance.”
“I can’t do this,” Steve admits. He drops his hand, but doesn’t move away, and Tony misses it terribly, but stays still. “Obviously,” he huffs on a silent laugh, and Tony’s heart pounds in his chest. “You protect us, endlessly. From the people we’re trying to help, from needing to find other places to live, from Ross, from things like
But when he holds that hurt up against Steve—Steve as he’s been lately, the Steve who knows his carelessness has consequences and tries—it feels incongruous. He can sense Steve’s frustration at the past, his drive to be better, his willingness to listen.
“Never stopped you before,” Clint says. Tony hums and takes a seat kitty-corner to Clint, lets the silence settle. Clint’s wearing jeans. Tony looks down and, yeah, he’s also got work boots on. Clint sees him looking and half-smiles.
“That’s the most bullshit promise I’ve ever heard, even from you,” Tony says quietly, not laughing, not making fun, just desperate for reassurance.
“Are you okay?” Steve asks. Tony snorts and Steve says, “I’m serious.” His fingers aren’t holding Tony in place; Steve’s palm is still open, lingering lightly against Tony’s shoulder and it makes Tony focus in because Steve
“No,” Tony says, “I need you to listen to what I say and then to think about it, and not just react right away.”
“Please,” Tony scoffs. “After the first couple days of unconsciousness and touch-and-go-ness I was fine.
“I’m here,” Tony says at the same time. It doesn’t make anything worse, the touch and the words, so he does it a couple more times before Steve flexes around him—different, though, he thinks. Not so much terror-fueled agitation as testing the muscles. A sharper inhale, and then—
It’s good and long overdue, the maintenance on the bots. And in truth they are pretty self-sustaining these days; they know when to charge themselves and can change each other’s parts out if it becomes necessary, and if there’s anything else that needs to be done, FRIDAY can walk them through how to do it, but doing it himself always reassures Tony. This is one of the most consistent things in his life, originating from his MIT days, before DUM-E could feasibly do any of this himself—back before board meetings even, when Howard and Maria were still alive. The only human being to be so consistent in his life is Rhodey, though with the whole military career thing going on, they’ve mostly had a distant kind of consistency, meeting up briefly and catching up perpetually. (Which, all things considered, has been for the best; no person could be around Tony all those years without wanting to kill him, especially in those years immediately leading up to Iron Man—see Obie as exhibit A.)
If Tony was more inclined to crying he would be in tears. They’ve been fighting already for a couple of hours, and are quickly growing exhausted. They’ve almost all taken hits. Most of them are small, minor things, but it’s adding up. Scott’s shoulder was almost dislocated when he got caught mid-shrink by a tentacle. Sam rammed into one of the aliens from behind as it was closing in on Natasha, and he landed hard enough to sprain his ankle; it’s fine as long as he stays in the air, but if he has to land again he’s going to be in trouble. One of the newcomers had a scythe, of all things, and it sliced Steve right under the collarbone. Went through his uniform like warm butter, and Tony would be impressed if he wasn’t so pissed. It’s done bleeding now, he thinks, but only after the blood soaked through Steve’s uniform top, all the way down to his navel. Tony himself got caught by a tentacle around his knee when he flew too low. It didn’t last long, but just long enough to compromise the joint and warp the metal. It doesn’t even hurt if he keeps his leg straight.
Tony moves to step forwards but Steve steps back so he can perch on the edge of one of the workbenches, shoulders drooped in a way that Tony can’t tell if it’s dejected or relaxed. Undeterred, Tony keeps moving forward and leans back against the bench next to him, leaving about a foot of dead air between them.
Tony breathes deeply despite the flare of pain it causes, and he makes himself pause in the middle of the fight. He pivots around and sees his entire team. Rhodey’s the only one of them not here, but Tony’s secure in his knowledge that Jim’s safe on the east coast. FRIDAY records all footage from battles—it comes in handy in debriefs—and he’s never been happier to have the record. They’re all home, all fighting on the same side, watching each other’s backs. The stealth team is about to go underground, but in this moment, they’re together in the way he imagined back during the Battle of New York. He lets out the breath, shaky, and lets his eyes slip closed.
Tony even makes it the rest of the way to bed, and then, somewhat mechanically, to sleep. When he wakes up in the morning, he still can’t stand the thought of staying, so he starts packing a couple bags.
“We shouldn’t have to rely on missions popping up to get used to working together again,” Steve says, barreling on like it’s a speech he’s rehearsed. “We should know beforehand what’s—”
“That was…very longwinded,” Tony says, grin growing. “If I’d known I was gonna get a speech I would’ve pulled up a chair and made some popcorn. Did you practice that in front of the mirror?”
“…Malibu?” Tony erupts into laugher on the other side of the connection, and Steve grimaces. “I don’t know! I never really thought about it.”
“Okay,” Sam says slowly. “And, what, you think that if I float the idea he’ll be any more receptive to it? Please.”
“No!” Tony yells. He feels just as manic as Steve looked a minute ago, but now Steve just seems kind of worried. Tony makes himself take a deep breath that doesn’t help at all, but he’s not screaming when he opens his mouth this time. “Look, it’s already in place, mostly. I’m making Barnes a new arm, T’Challa and I have been talking about different therapy techniques he can try. Just—call His Royal Kittiness and give the go ahead.”
“You must be tired if you didn’t notice,” Tony continues, and wrinkles his nose for dramatic effect. He presses the pads of his fingers into Steve, just enough to really feel. Steve’s smile abruptly turns sweet.
Steve’s eyes are so blue, even in the different, dim, unnatural lighting of his office. Not a hint of green.
“Get in line,” Tony says, voice a little harder than he means for it to be. “If you think I was getting any kind of joy or fulfillment out of the setup then—then I don’t know what to tell you. We thought you were gone, and Ross is the Secretary of State. We can’t not communicate with him, and it’s not like the Accords were his brain baby, not by a—”
It’s bad, probably. He can feel air on his back, which means part of his uniform has been shredded away. It hurts when he hunches his shoulders forward too far.
“Feds are on their way,” Bruce says over the comm, and Tony vaguely registers Clint and Wanda flying down to the ground on a field of red energy.
There’s a series of agreements from the entire team, and then they all quiet down and focus on getting there, Tony in the suit, Scott on an ant (and yes, he actually makes good time doing that, go figure, but that doesn’t mean Tony’s going to stop teasing him about it), the rest in a Quinjet. Tony switches over to a private comm channel and pings Steve.
“Anyways,” Steve says. “This eagle was Zeus’s—minion, I guess.” He lowers his arm back to the ground, and his knuckles rest against Tony’s thigh. Carefully,
The first thing he does is send out that email to the other Avengers, but while he’s waiting for replies he digs out the design for the hardware that’ll let him program and reprogram the nanites. He spends most of the morning fabricating what looks like a slightly smaller hemodialysis machine for blood transfusions, and in between work on that he lays out for various scans and takes blood samples for FRIDAY to analyze.
Tony’s head rolls towards Clint and his eyes open fully just long enough to look up at Clint and break Steve’s heart.
“‘Kay,” Steve says on the exhale. He doesn’t look happy in the slightest. In fact, his eyes scrunch in what seems to be pain, but his breathing evens out to a deliberate pattern and he stays still on the bench.
“Not necessarily,” Steve agrees. “But I don’t think acknowledging what happened is going to set us back any. You—there’s no excuse for what we let happen. What I, as the leader of this team, let happen. And I’m sorry, Tony. I think I need to spell out what went wrong just so—we can both know that I’m at least capable of understanding why it was so messed up.” The tree quakes as Steve moves. When Tony looks up, Steve’s right there, half leaning on the apple tree’s trunk, half wrapped around it. “So I can prove I won’t let it happen again.”
It wasn’t that he disliked the other Avengers. Far from it. In fact, he’d never been so close to people in his life. It was just…people were tiring and loud and always all over the place, all the time. He didn’t get to go home at the end of the day anymore and take off his masks because there was always someone around. The lab’s always been a safe place, and after the rogues came back from Wakanda, none of them were allowed in for a good two months until something sparked wrong in a materials test and Tony got knocked into a wall and passed out. Natasha had had to break in, which had taken about five minutes, while Tony had bled from his head onto the floor. After that incident, Tony had given emergency overrides back to Nat and Steve.
“I think I should be offended,” Scott says easily as he reaches for a fork, not sounding offended at all.
of his gauntlet meeting his helmet. Steve’s calf looks a little worse for wear, but he’s standing on it resolutely, taking deep, slow breaths, like he’s daring someone to challenge him on it.
“Neither is the—Gi-Ant Man,” Tony says, waving his hand at the horrendous wordplay. “You both get absolutely knackered after being all big and mighty—which, actually, do you get fatigued after shrinking down, too?”
“Who doesn’t like root beer?” Tony asks when he catches his breath, and he’s wiping his eyes on his shirtsleeve when he says it. “It tastes like vanilla!”
Tony’s still purposefully not looking at Steve but there’s a distinct pause before he replies, and Tony knows he’s reigning in his automatic response.
“That was—the sentiment I got from the others,” he says. “But it’s—uh, kind of you to say outright.”
Steve glances down and, sure enough, there are metal braces strapped around Rhodey’s legs. They don’t look particularly comfortable, but they’re all the sleek lines and hidden circuitry that reek of a Stark design.
“Steve,” Tony says, cutting him off. Then, to Clint, “If someone had come to the compound, joined the team, with the same attitude towards Wanda as she had towards me, would it have been a point of discussion?”
“I’ve been trying to get your attention,” Tony says, playing along. He bites his tongue, rather hard, considering. Fuck it, he decides. If Steve doesn’t already think he’s completely insane, he might as well go for it.
She trails off, it’s obviously Tony’s turn to say something, so he opens his mouth, and the only thing he can think of spills out.
“Damn, Cobain,” Tony says, “I was half-hoping His Kittiness would fill in the blanks, but that would be—yeah. I don’t know if ‘too easy’ is the phrase I’m looking for, but it would be too easy.”
“Oh, you go for angel-women,” Rhodey allows, “but the men? Do I need to remind you about Tiberius Stone? He exists, he was a thing.”
Standing in front of the elevator, Tony shakes himself out, each leg and his arms, ends it with a head roll, and goes to his room. When he gets there, he stands in the middle, not sure what to do with himself. As much as he knows it’s not a reliable way to gather data, he focuses on how he feels. He doesn’t think he’s in any way fundamentally different from how he was just days ago, but then again, would he really be able to tell? He does feel different, but maybe only superficially?
“Only if you’re already making some,” Bucky says, and Tony nods, taking a route to the kitchen that lets him keep Bucky in his periphery almost the whole time.
“So where exactly does ’Tasha keep her phone when she’s wearing those dresses?” Tony says. “She always seems to have it, even when there’s no room for underwear in there.”
“Natasha’s right,” Bruce says, looking small and miserable. “Unless Tony’s changed it more than we already had.” He grimaces. “There should be more safeties in place than when Killian was using it, at least.”
The whole couple thing is still new, and Steve’s trying his damnedest to respect Tony’s private space. Tony’d been so hesitant when they first decided to try out this relationship. There’d been an entire speech.
There’s a bit of resignation, then. Probably nobody puts any of the blame on Rhodey’s shoulders; he did, after all, pay for the whole ordeal more permanently than anyone. There aren’t many people to be considered faultless in the fiasco—even Bruce and Thor carry the burden of not having so much as witnessed the whole thing. Certain people, though, hold much less culpability than others: Peter, who’s legally a child; Bucky, under mind control and doing his best to stay under the radar; and, to a certain extent, Rhodey, whose views and loyalties have always kept him firmly in a chain of command. None of whom have raised complaints about the supposed necessity of therapy to stay on the team.
It’s ridiculous to be thinking about Ultron right now. It’s probably even more ridiculous to be quoting Pinocchio, but the thought fills up his head and spills out. A huge something hits him over the back so hard it punches a gag out of Tony. No thanks, he thinks. He hates vomiting in the suit.
“Uh,” Tony says, and it’s a higher pitch than he strictly means for it to be. “Is that what we would call it?”
Sam’s phone buzzes in his pocket, but Steve doesn’t seem to have his on him, so he leans over Sam’s shoulder as the pictures are pulled up. Sam laughs.
Uncertainty is complicated. In mechanical, practical problems, he can poke and prod at them, adjust them until it’s all worked out. (At least most of the time. Again: Ultron.) People, however, experience poking and prodding, and don’t reset with every new attempt. These people-populated scenarios are far more fraught. He hates having to face this kind of unpredictability he hates, the kind he doesn’t want to face at all.
Steve paces, because he can’t get into a physical fight with Pepper, and he can’t leave to go to the gym, not now, and because if he doesn’t move he thinks he might fall asleep, even standing. He’s cold and everything itches at this point in the healing process, and he feels like everything is two inches to the left. It’s a feeling he’s been getting since he woke up from the ice, or maybe since Bucky fell, he doesn’t know which. But it echoes inside of him in moments like this:
“Tony!” Steve calls after him. Tony stops, turns so he can see Steve out of one eye. Steve, for his part, is leaning against the doorframe, casual as can be, arms crossed over his chest. “I won’t go to sleep for another couple hours or so. If you wanna—hang out.”
A little while later Tony gets an idea for a new comm interface from an insult hurled onscreen and starts to multitasks. He flips the HUD glasses down from where they’re resting on top of his head and uses the visual tracking to make notes while still watching middle-aged women throw drinks on each other.
Tony thinks of Natasha showing up and pulling bananas out of thin air, of her believing or disbelieving him at his word. He could use that, some of her crisis management, he thinks, and then he remembers the ridiculous, “Of course—anything,” over the phone, like a promise because he just doesn’t know when to stop, and Tony’s mouth is open before he even completely decides, but when he speaks, it’s to say Steve’s name.
“I’m not sorry,” Tony says. He can see, vividly, where this conversation could go: down the how-could-you-keep-this-from-me road that leads straight to Ultron yet again. God, he’s so tired of this conversation. “I did what I thought was best for the—”
His skin is still buzzing faintly, constantly, and it doesn’t stop under the spray of water like he’d been hoping. There are just layers to the buzz now, a tingle under the static feeling of water, a million nerves calling for attention, tapping at him. It sets his teeth on edge.
“Ohmygod," Peter's saying. “I’m so sorry, Mr. Stark. I didn’t even know about the attack until I was between classes, I swear I would’ve come if I’d known—”
“There’s gotta be a portal,” Tony says, the realization hitting him so suddenly he feels a little dizzy. (Well, realization and blood loss.) “That’s how they got hundreds of aliens into the fucking middle of Chicago without anyone noticing. There’s a portal.”
