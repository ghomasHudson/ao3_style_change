“I heard,” Jarvis nodded, “I will look for one immediately. Master Tony, do you think you should get in contact with your school about your extended absence?”
Steve started to nod and Tony continued, “more than touch them, I’m afraid.” Steve blinked up at him, his lips shaping the word ‘
Tony didn’t think he looked nearly enough like Howard to fool anyone, let alone a super-soldier with perfect eyesight. He wondered just how angry the Captain would be once he realized the deception.
The clinic was empty and silent save for Tony walking the halls. He turned on the TV in the waiting room as he waited for six o'clock to arrive.
Jarvis shifted in his seat, “Well,” He took a deep breath, “Exercise is a good start. Physical health can often make quite an impact on one’s mental health. Professional help would not be amiss. After my wife was… gravely injured, I was deeply affected. Master Stark- the agency he is a part of, Shield - they employ a good many doctors. I’m sure they have one who could talk with you, especially considering your circumstances.”
Tony figured it had been sitting around, waiting for its occupant far longer than Howard would ever admit.
“Mmhm.” Rhodey knocked his knee against Tony’s and two immediately dissolved into another shoving match.
“Steve would like to find a boxing gym.” Tony told him, watching as the man folded up his newspaper and set it down.
Tony audibly groaned. He couldn't just sit around fantasizing about his patient. Well, a patient. Either way, it was wrong.
Sharon imagined Natasha, with her effortlessly curled red hair splayed across the pillow and her long, ballet-dancers legs wrapped around Steve's waist as he rutted into her.
He’d been saying something but still in a fog of sleep and then startled into consciousness, Tony hadn’t understood anything.
Behind him, Tony heard another medical assistant talking to a patient, “Just this way Mrs. Mendez, that’s fine.” He looked back to see her leading an older woman on a walker.
Steve nodded and Tony lifted his palms till just his fingertips were touching the man’s chest. He moved his fingers over the pinkened flesh to Steve’s areolas and wondered if he could make the man come by just playing with his nipples.
"I’m not insulting you, Tony, I’m calling you a liar. Anyway, Ty's out of town for the weekend and I’m bored and horny. Want to come over and try to break our record for number of times you can knot me in a night?"
Steve laughed, “As far as I’m aware, I’m Steve Rogers. I crashed an airplane in 1945 and woke up last week and Tony was there dressed as his own father.”
“I don't think I've ever seen one of those in action.” Rhodey said with a laugh, “Scared the mess outta me.”
She turned her attention back to Sharon's mother, "Howard's a fool, he doesn't know what a treasure he has in his hands. Reminds me of Steve," she said wistfully, "A diamond in the rough. Tony just needs someone to see the value in him."
- so good. So tight- Tony, love the way you feel. Being inside you. Love being inside you- love you-"
. Tony was his doctor. He needed to remember that. Tony busied himself with preparing the exam room. He logged onto the computer and input all the relevant information for Steve’s visit. Then, as a last-minute thought, he shut off the monitor.
Her reputation would be in shambles. Putting her personal life on display as an agent would be career suicide.
Tony sat back in his chair, “Well… I'm telling you there's nothing wrong with seeking help now. There are some mental health facilities around but nothing like that.”
No one agreed which way was best. Obie thought they should take as much time as possible before telling him but Howard disagreed. Once Steve started asking questions and Tony, posing as Howard, began dodging them – Steve would only grow more and more suspicious.
Steve Rogers breathed out, "yeah." And took Tony's offered hand. Tony managed to grip for just a moment before Steve pulled his hand back, audibly swallowing.
He was amazingly easy to talk to. He didn't just hear Tony talk, but he listened and asked questions when he didn't understand a reference or when he wanted to know more.
Tony raised both hands and shifted them in the air, palms up, as if he were weighing both, “Little from column a, little from column b. You’re not gonna flip out if a guy says you’ve got a nice ass, are you?”
“Thank you.” Steve murmured, “Your offer sounds great, Howard. If I decide to accept, I’d be more than happy to have Tony help me out but only if he’s willing.”
," she said the last word in a mocking tone. "You think you've changed just 'cause your patients are poor and ugly, but you're still the same rat bastard who fucked all those Maxim models behind my back, Tony Stark, you haven't changed a bit and you never will."
“Wrong?” Howard Stark laughed brightly and Tony yanked the receiver away as if it had slapped him across the face.
Steve shook his head, too, “Confusing. Regardless, I liked him. Batman was depressing and Superman was a little too perfect.”
Steve gave another low whistle at the sight of the Stark’s home, chuckling with embarrassment when he realized what he’d done.
“Yeah, Dad. This is… great. Amazing. I’ll put clothes on. Throw some stuff in a bag. Yeah… uh- just… I’ll be waiting for the taxi. Tell him to honk once so he doesn’t wake the dorm… uhm-“
Steve kept his eyes averted, looking away from Tony in humiliation. His chest heaved and the movement drew Tony’s eyes to Steve’s pretty pink nipples, still hard and absolutely begging for attention. Tony cleared his throat and breathed in, getting a lungful of Steve’s scent.
You can't seriously expect me to believe that." Sharon laughed humorlessly, "It must kill you that so many people want Steve and I to get back together but no one even
it would feel amazing to free his cock and bury himself in the humiliated omega’s tight hole. To finally give Steve what his body was so clearly demanding.
Steve smiled back then, teeth shining in the light of the movie and for the first time since he met him, Tony thought it might be the most real smile he’d seen on Steve’s face.
6:10 and nothing. No Steve Rogers, no calls. Silence but for the anchor on the TV reporting an accident on the freeway that was causing long delays for drivers headed home and the rumble of thunder in the skies above.
“All set then?” Tony moved to the sink to wash up. “Now then, according to your chart you just had your semi-annual exam a few weeks ago but we’re gonna go ahead and make sure nothing’s changed, alright?”
The two men exited the office and Steve graciously waited while Tony locked the door behind him. They walked together, following Nat and Bucky who were far out of earshot.
“No- no, no” Tony held his hand to his chest, clutched at his pounding heart, “No, god, don't apologize. I'm- I'm so sorry.”
“Tony-“ Howard called before Tony could hang up, “I’ll see you soon. I can’t believe you’re finally going to meet him.” Howard gave a triumphant laugh, “Everything’s going to be alright, Tony. Captain America… he… you don’t know how much this means to me.”
Steve exhaled sharply and closed his eyes for a moment, “Okay- uhm… do you… think you stand a chance with me? That’s pretty presumptuous.”
He’d been there for 5 days now, sleeping on a couch close to the bed. He took breaks once a day to shower and shave. He took his meals by the Captain’s side and read books and newspapers from the 40s. When he needed a break from those, he listened to a radio that somehow only played music from the 40s and 50s.
6:25 rolled around and Tony shut off the TV in the waiting room. Unbelievable. Steve Rogers hadn't shown up and worse, he didn't even have the decency to call.
Tony watched Steve’s eyes flick to the computer, a look of unease on his perfect features, “Um,” his voice caught. His expression shifted into one of compliance.
Bucky laughed then, “No, nah - IED got me during a routine patrol. Lemme tell you, though, that fucking sucked too.”
Steve shook his head, looking pole-axed, “Not exactly.” Steve’s voice slightly cracked, “It just felt weird.”
After dinner, which included another round of Howard deflecting questions about one Agent Carter, they took Steve to their New York penthouse. Howard disappeared into his study, explaining he had more calls to make.
Steve looked up at him, startled out of his ruminating, “Oh- jeez, Tony, I’m sorry. I shouldn’t talk about this. No one wants to hear-”
Steve let out a shuddering breath and Tony was pleased to see that his blush went past his throat and colored his chest and no doubt further down where the sheet teasingly covered.
“Well, it looks like I was worried for nothing. Everything looks good, Steve, so we can move onto the next part of the examination.”
Tony spent his car-ride home imagining meeting Steve at a coffee shop. Asking him to dinner. Seeing his cheeks go pink, his perfect pink lips parted to speak.
“Thanks, J. Oh, Steve. I can't tell you how excited I am to be the one to introduce you to junk food.”
Steve Rogers in all his gorgeous blond glory and absolutely soaking wet. At the sight of him, all thoughts and concerns of ethics swiftly drained out of Tony. Steve Rogers’ sodden white button-down shirt was nearly translucent and Tony could clearly see a pair of flawless, pink nipples.
“He releases quite a bit of scent and slick during his exams." Dr. Edwards confided in him. "He gets so embarrassed about it but it’s nothing I haven’t seen before. I have no issue when a patient is like that but his scent seems to stick around and another patient complained about it. I’ll just have to have the receptionist be more cautious in the future about his appointment times. Perhaps later in the day so he’ll be the last.”
“Yes–you too, Dr. Edwards.” Tony gathered his things and checked around the clinic to make sure no one else was lagging behind. As the newest doctor to have joined the practice, he was entrusted with closing up shop at the end of the day and locking everything. He shut off the lights and locked the door, contemplating the chances of meeting Steve Rogers outside of the clinic as he walked to his car.
“That’s correct. I was an aide under a General when Master Stark was able to help me in a difficult situation.”
He sighed, "You have to know there was never any kind of 'competition' between us, Sharon." Tony punctuated the word with air quotes.
Laughter, breathless and delighted. "You're so voracious today, Cap. Am I not putting out enough for you?"
“You two remind me of me and my best friend.” Steve’s smile flagged a little, “Wish you could’ve met him. Buck-”
Steve glanced at Tony’s stung expression before piping up, “Howard, if Tony doesn’t want to- I mean, I’m sure I can figure out a lot of things on my own.”|
She wondered that as she texted him several days after her discovery, asking if he was free and available to talk.
Howard frowned, looking anywhere but Steve’s eyes, “… I suppose that’s up to her. She’s been notified that you’ve been found. She… she hasn’t sent word back yet.”
Steve Rogers was returning and Tony had just agreed to see him after office hours when everyone else would be gone.
Steve looked down at his hands, "No one would look twice at Tony and I spending so much time together if they thought I had a beautiful girlfriend on my arm. It helped too that you're so… career oriented. That made it easier for us."
He looked like the perfect all-American: healthy, blond, wide-shoulders. Straight as a whistle, fit as a fiddle. Long dark lashes that fluttered against his cheeks as he slept, perhaps dreaming. Pretty lips. Big hands.
Tony could imagine it. Steve Rogers on his table–legs parted, secure in the stirrups. He could practically smell his excessive slick leaking out of his hole, pooling on the table and dripping off onto the floor.
Tony ignored the mumbled complaints and grabbed the phone, nearly yanking it free from the wall-mount, “Dad? Dad, what’s wrong?”
He moved to the end of the exam table and began pulling the stirrups up from their hidden position. As he began adjusting them into place he heard Steve suck in a shuddering gasp.
Tony climbed out of his car, furious at how quickly his ex had been able to rile him up. He was different than the man he was months ago– a cheating, lying, drinking dipshit. Being around Rumiko and Ty was like sitting next to radioactive waste– sooner or later their poison would infect you and everything else nearby. He had cut off most communication with them and felt better for it. Still, as Tony stepped into the elevator headed to his floor, he couldn't help but hear Rumiko's words on repeat:
But then, Sharon realized, she could hear the bed-springs creaking. Could it have been the porn? The noise was loud.
Tony could feel the warmth of him as Mr. Rogers moved behind him. Tony lifted his chin and breathed in. There was the slightest scent in the air–
He stepped away from the exam table and subtly adjusted his own erection; a reminder of how careful he needed to be.
"Who gives a shit? He's not here to do the job, fuck him. Besides he's not dumb enough to believe I'm gonna sit around for
“No, thankfully. One of my patients, a very nice young gentleman, but he always has a reaction to his physical exams. Gets a bit excited.”
attention. Everyone showered him with attention. He was in magazines and newspapers after winning awards at his young age. His escapades featured on the news, 'Wiz Kid Tony Stark was spotted, drunk, outside of a Boston bar last night. The Bar is currently under investigation as to whether or not they served alcohol to the underage prodigy-"
From the corner of his eye, he could see Steve’s mouth drop open. He mouthed wordlessly and his whole body tensed.
“Neither are most of the people who go to psychiatrists. Though, I suppose in my case, it depends on who you ask.” Tony smirked, “
“There’s nothing to be sorry for, Steve. Really. Everyone has different reactions and one response isn’t more valid than another.”
Tony smiled tremulously, “That's rare to hear.” he swallowed against a sudden lump in his throat, “Listen, I hope I'm not being annoying- you sure you don’t want to rest instead…?”
Tony swallowed hard. Despite the bad blood between them, Rumiko’s offer was tempting thanks to all his fantasizing about Steve Rogers. It would feel amazing to get his knot deep in someone right now. But he and Rumiko hadn't been together in months–not since he turned down her father's offer to set him up in a private clinic with wealthy and celebrity patients, and Ru dumped him. Within days he heard she was with Tiberius Stone–his on-again-off-again friend and once upon a deeply misguided time, his fuck-buddy.
Jarvis knocked then and entered, bringing along a rolling cart piled high with all kinds of edibles.
Her Aunt Peggy had been reading the article to Sharon's mother and exclaiming about his successes. "He is going to do great things, I know it. He's going to change the world."
“Well, exercise certainly isn’t my number one choice of things to do but hey, I always try things once. Do you have to keep fit or something?”
"There's the Rumiko I know. It's been a real treat hearing from you. Do me a favor and lose my number, hm?" He hung up as she continued her hissing, spitting vitriol. Tony stared at his phone, half expecting it to ring again. He considered the repercussions of blocking Rumiko, yet again. He'd done it before and even changed his own number but she'd always found him and coaxed him back into being quote-unquote
"You–for heaven's–Dean, I know you're high as a fucking kite right now. What drugs did you take?" Tony was angry.
“Okay, sounds good,” the man replied. “You still have about twenty minutes before the kids leave, but you might want to get a move on. You don’t want to tear any of your stitches.”
"Never stuck around in one place long enough to last a season, so let's not push our luck." The boy spat in return.
Dean opened his eyes then, meeting Steve’s with his own. Even after the panic attack and the sex talk, it was the most vulnerable Steve had ever seen the boy. The look of pure amazement and disbelief on Dean’s face just then was one Steve would never forget.
“But seriously, kid.” Tony straightened up. “Have you been safe with every person you were ever with?”
Sam put renewed interest in the trophy as he shrugged again, quiet for a moment. "I mean, we haven't seen him in like, two years. I–" He took a breath. "I'm sad, obviously, but, I guess, I sort of knew he wasn't coming back."
Not only did Dean stop fidgeting, he smiled more, snarked less and was overall just a more pleasant fourteen year old.
"Because it felt really good. And if it feels really good, it can't be bad, right?" He asked his foster parents.
Dropping himself onto the couch heavily, he sat with his knee continually bouncing in residual anger. Or was it anxiety now?
Sorry for the brief hiatus, last week was jam-packed!! Warning for a short chapter ahead, it's more of a build-up to the final chapter than anything.
When two uniformed police officers appeared at the door of the Stark residence, the occupants were–understandably–worried. When those officers then insisted on having individual interviews, all hell broke loose.
"If you're sure," Steve started, pulling his finger out before pushing two back in. Tony swung his head back and groaned, letting the sensation fill him up, thrusting down slightly.
Stepping off the man's back, Natasha walked around and watched his eyes rolled up into his head and he slumped the final distance to the floor, wheezing and gasping until the body finally stopped twitching.
The man sighed, reached into his pocket, and threw something towards Dean. Reflex alone had him catching the object before it could hit him in the face.
"So you're okay with them staying for a long time," Tony summarized, smiling at the nod their eldest gave. "Nat? I know you've been having a tough time."
"It's been longer than he said it would be, I'll give you that. But he always comes back." The boy admitted quietly. "I swear it's for work, he usually leaves us with enough money and he's not gone for longer than a week at a time." Dean had his eyes closed. Fighting off the knee jerk reaction to run. This is wrong. Never trust the law, they're ignorant. But something about the man and the situation just made sense to reveal the half-truth.
Another huge thank you to my beta for all her help and I can't wait to read all of your reactions to this chapter!!!
"What?" The boy shrugged. "You said I couldn't go barging in and asking about it. I sat here all nice and polite before I asked."
The fact was, that was how Dean got psychiatrists off his back. Hit on them until they got uncomfortable. It had nothing to do with respect. Not that he'd tell Steve and Tony that.
Dean didn't know how to respond. The room lay silent until Clint reached for the picture Dean had dropped of Sam in the bath.
"She says to just play it by ear now that you're back, and that hopefully, everything will go back to normal."
Thor buried his little brother in a crushing hug, cutting off Loki's words. "Ég elska þig Loki. Svo mikið. Ég kenni þér ekki um hegðun þína og aðferðir til að takast á við, þú varst barn sem var að ganga í gegnum mikið. Þú ert nú fullorðinn maður sem vinnur í gegnum áfallið þitt og ég er svo stoltur af þér. Ég er alltaf stoltur af þér." {
“The way you’re just pushing your wellbeing aside. Sam sees that, Dean, and he looks up to you. If you go about not telling us when you’re injured or in pain, he’s not going to, either,” Steve explained.
The parents mouthed to each other in confusion and followed their youngest as the boy tackled the man in a hug. Dean, however, was less than enthused to see the man Sam called ‘uncle’, dragging his feet and looking at the ground as they approached the two.
"That sucks," the woman knelt down to look Clint in the eye. "Can I help you find a new home? I promise that you'll be safe and warm and fed if you come with me." The officer looked at Natasha next. "You'll be safe. You can trust me."
The reprieve only lasted so long though, and Loki was once again causing everyone's frustrations to rise once more.
"Oh no, that is not a good idea," Tony said, hearing Dean groan as the man started to shift the boy onto his side. "We are not having you choke if you puke. Not a good experience, I can tell you. I'm gonna be right back, Dean, okay? If you need me, just yell."
The teen knew he was lucky that Tony donated a ton of money to the school, or he probably would've been suspended after the stunt he pulled yesterday. He only hoped that would save him from another punishment after he skipped class today.
The Captain’s order, while intended for Tony, affected the boy, as well. Through gritted teeth, Dean bit back, “I didn’t bring them into the house! You asked for them at school, and I gave them to you.”
"You know what else is mine?" the genius continued, then snaked his hand down to grasp the captain's full erection. "This. This is mine. I don't care who else has touched it or how many times you play with it, but who does it belong to?"
From their first morning with the family, Sam and Dean fit into this chaos seamlessly. Sam bombarded Bruce with questions about whichever textbook the college student had chosen to read that day, and Dean made himself useful, flipping pancakes onto the communal plate to ensure the stack never ran out.
The parents glanced at each other silently, then Tony rested his elbows on the table, leaning towards Sam. "And? What do you think about that?"
"You're telling me you don't have a single gun in this house? Nothing to protect yourself with?" Dean's voice getting louder. "You were in the army, you know how to use them and you're telling me you don't have a single gun in this house."
“Heya Sam. You get any taller and you’re gonna give your old father a run for his money,” Bobby stated, messing the young boys’ hair.
Done with the defensiveness, Dean pulled the laptop away from Loki, slamming it shut in the process.
“Dean, tell us the truth.” Steve’s voice was firmer, less coddling. “We need to know. You’re much too hot right now, and we need to know what you took and how many this time.”
“A comfortable suit. Tony and I are going to take you to get one sometime this week,” Steve answered.
Sam looked at his brother for a moment and winked. "You're not the only one that can fool a doctor, Dean. Dr. Mills was just the first one to see through me."
With another smirk, the man replied: "Well, since you asked so nicely," then proceeded to tug the front of his pants and underwear until the seams gave way, leaving the man completely naked with nothing but red lines to show where the materials had given way. Immediately, Steve's dick bounced up and Tony licked his lips at the sight.
Tony watched his husband help push the hospital bed of his best friend off the plane, giving the man's hand a squeeze in farewell as they loaded him into another transport vehicle. Steve stood, staring longingly at the truck, but beamed a radiant smile when he saw his husband waiting a mere hundred yards away.
The boxes of John's things had been stored in one of the many guest bedrooms until the brothers could decide what to do with them. This didn't stop the boys from thinking about the sentimental objects, though. Both laying in bed after bringing everything home, Sam and Dean were quiet. They knew the other was awake, but they lamented in the silence and just revealed in the dark about everything they'd learned.
The only sound was Dean's rough breathing. He was bent over with his head almost at his knees as he tried to catch his breath. Steve kept rubbing the teen's back and whispering words of reassurance. Tony, for the first time, was calm. He watched Dean struggle to breathe and his anger disappeared as quickly as it came.
It turned out that walking the streets covered in blood and grime and wearing next to no clothes with a five-year-old in tow makes for a lot of stares. Natasha ignored the looks as she pulled Clint across another street. Truth be told, she had no idea where she was going, she just needed to get out of the house that was her own personal hell for the past two years. She didn't see the places or people that they passed, everything moved together in a timeless blur of motion that came with the words creaming in her head:
Tony nodded vigorously. “Do not be afraid to tell us when you’re hurt, Dean. Self-medicating is dangerous and can cause even more problems, if it doesn’t kill you straight out.”
“Alright,” Tony began. “First of all, Nat was right to apologize. She did something wrong and needed to own up to it. Second, I could be mistaken, but I hardly ever am, I think you feel the need to make some apologies of your own.”
Dean’s stomach finally settled, and, with the hands’ help, he flopped back onto the bed. Exhausted, Dean cracked his eyes open to see Tony drawing the blankets up to his chest.
“That especially extends to myself,” the man added as an afterthought. “Now, lay down, close your eyes, and go to sleep. When you’re feeling better, we’ll talk about what just happened.”
"Nope. Tonight we will have mind-blowing sex, just like always and then tomorrow morning you're going to kiss me within an inch of my life and say 'see you later'," the man insisted. "That way you have to come back safe and sound because we never said goodbye, so you can't die."
Dean sighed and went to run his hand over his face but stopped when his side wound twinged. Hissing in pain, the teen relented, “Fine, Sammy. You win. It was werewolves.”
The balding man removed his glasses and ran a hand down his face. "Abuse. All of them. Only one requested the boys move because they found occult symbols painted under their rugs. Dean said it was for protection, but the couple wanted to exorcise him in return, so we both agreed it best to remove them from the home."
Squeezing Sam’s shoulders in apology, the man let go and clasped the sick boy’s hand with both of his own, reassuring the anxious teen of his presence. Dean sighed in his sleep, and he immediately eased back into an easy slumber as all tension drained from his body. Steve’s hand, it seemed, was the anchor keeping Dean’s subconscious tethered to reality when his nightmares threatened to overtaken him.
"How can we help him if he's scared of us!" The engineer threw his hands up in frustration. Steve walked behind the man and wrapped his arms around his middle.
Dean and Loki had a… disagreement, let’s say, today. I had to call Thor home early from football practice to stay with Clint and Sam while I picked them up from school. When I saw them, my fucking heart stopped. They were both covered in blood. But don’t worry! The only casualty was a bruised nose and a VERY strained relationship snapping….
"Their names are Steve and Tony. Steve is an ex-military Captain and Tony is an engineer. They have two adopted sons already with their eyes on a third." Mr. Coulson explained.
was the reason you had to leave, instead of telling him how they hurt you.” Steve reached for Dean’s hand as he spoke, expecting the flinch he received in response, but was happily surprised when the teen quickly recovered, his eyes flying open as he grabbed the soldier’s hand before it was out of reach. Steve beamed at the action, though a worried frown briefly shadowed his face at the heat still coming off the boy.
Tony didn’t even look ruffled at Dean’s comment; he just let out his own tired sigh. “Okay, I’ll go. I’m gonna clean up the mess, then I’ll leave you to sleep for a while.” It was then Dean noticed that he hadn’t been puking into a bucket earlier, but straight onto the hardwood floor–and Tony’s shoes.
When they were both 'acceptably dressed', Tony reached to pull the door open, when Steve stopped him and pulled the other man into a tight hug.
Steve smiled and obliged. Pushing in slowly, the man let his husband get used to the full feeling, stopping at every tense and gasp until he was fully seated inside. He gave the other man a minute, holding himself back from the wonderful feeling until getting the nod to continue.
“What?” Dean froze as he realized his mistake. The teen was having trouble keeping his thoughts straight; his head hurt, and his fever wasn’t helping. In the confusion, he’d slipped up.
The doctor taught her some sign language to communicate, but she refused to learn more than the basic, adamant that Clint was the only one she would 'talk' to.
“It’s a risk you are going to have to take. And with luck and patience, hopefully they will understand why you told someone,” Thor answered. Clint was still fidgeting with a dish towel, rocking from side to side behind the two, awkwardly glancing about the kitchen.
Steve started crying in earnest now, doubling over in his chair. “I can’t lose them, Tony! I can’t!”
"Surprisingly smooth?" Tony finished his husband's sentence. The two had just watched Loki leave their office after the teen apologized for his past actions, and promised to do better in the future. "Yeah, I was thinking the same thing."
For those that guessed it, the dialogue from the previous chapter was from Season 2 Episode 16: The Houses of the Holy! It's a wonderful turning point to the brothers and I couldn't resist putting it in!
A pause. "I read about your stints in rehab, Mr. Stark. I trust I don't have to worry about them boys being at the other end of an empty bottle." The words were heavy with implication.
"Why did he say something about the others and not that one?" Tony was now listening intently to the former CPS worker.
"Oh no. With words like that there was definitely a reason." Tony looked pointedly at him. "Out with it."
Tony not so gently grasped Steve's chin, then leaned over and bit the man's lips lightly. "Every noise that comes out of these lips? They belong to me. Isn't that right?"
The question made the atmosphere in the room go tense. Steve gripped the armrests of the chair so tightly his knuckles were turning white before he took a deep breath and forced himself to relax.
Mr Wilson sank himself in one of the armchairs and gestured for Sam and Dean to take a seat as well.
"Papa?" Thor called out when Steve shut Bruce's door. The man was standing in the middle of the hallway, shuffling from side to side.
The engineer yelped as he felt his husband squeeze his crotch and bite lightly on his ear, before straightening up and heading for the door.
“Well, then there’s no reason for him not to tell us!” the man responded, agitated at the lack of progress they were making.
"Yeah, sure!" Sam replied, opening another one of the boxes. "Dean!" he gasped, pulling out an object. "My soccer trophy!"
"Daddy got really mad and locked us in here," the boy explained. "But you weren't waking up and I got scared."
"I didn't want to believe it. My big brother getting hurt to protect me? Why would I want to accept that?" Sam scoffed, the darkness making him brave in the face of everything in their past. "I also knew that if it were true, you'd be too selfless to fight back. You put up a good front, but you're a teddy bear at heart, Dean. I knew you would only fight back if I was in danger, so I tempted them," Sam explained under his breath. Dean had to strain to hear the confession.
The colour followed Natasha, no matter how many times she cut her hair with rusted kitchen shears or washed her hands, she couldn't stop seeing that colour. Every time she closed her eyes she saw the man, dead, surrounded by blood, or the faceless men that made the blood come out of her instead, and with it, the feeling of overwhelming fear and helplessness.
“Alright.” He nodded. “But I am going to need the truth about what happened because I know the fight at school story is BS.”
Cleaning herself with the rusted sink water, Natasha fought not to wince, steeling herself against the pain.
Dean shook his head. "No. The more I make them uncomfortable, the less they focus on me." He admitted. "Plus, it's pretty funny too."
"Let me make sure I have this right." Steve started. "At first it was funny, then you couldn't stop and then you were in too deep. Is that correct?"
is the basis for every other good relationship in his life, so if he doesn't know why you react to certain things, or why you do things a certain way, how do you expect him to have healthy relationships in the future?"
Tony takes a moment to think, then sighs. "It's a nice thought, but I think we should talk to them individually first. Maybe if we get Loki to stop aggravating Dean on purpose we can eventually make them talk in a civil way. Plus, I really want to focus on Dean relinquishing his caregiver role on Sam and Clint."
, he thought, before mustering his courage and knocking on the door. Earlier, when Loki, Dean, and Natasha were planning future schemes, the raven-haired teen had realized that he was actually smiling and laughing freely.
"Yeah," Bobby said after a moment. "John wasn't the best father figure when Mary died. He put Dean in charge of Sam, not just 'looking out for him', but the boy basically raised his little brother on his own. Dean deserves a chance to just… be a kid."
"No. You saved my life, it doesn't matter what happened in between," Bucky gave his friend a stern look. "And stop blaming yourself. I know how your brain works, and I don't blame you, so you shouldn't either."
"Bye, Papa!" The kids called out, waving enthusiastically behind Tony as the man reached to disconnect the call.
“Sorry, sorry, my bad,” the man apologized, then sighed deeply. “Fine. You obviously don’t trust us enough to tell us. Is there any adult you would tell?”
"I don't know why you're getting so angry! Yeah, I want to know you're secrets, Dean, I'm your brother, we shouldn't
Dean rolled his eyes before answering. "Awesome. Saved a kitten, walked an old lady across the street and got nominated for a nobel prize." He snarked.
"I think we both know that Dean isn't one to look for help when he feels he can handle a situation," Steve interjected. "Although, why didn't you attempt to take them in when their father disappeared? Did you know CPS had them?"
"Oh, oh honey are you sure?" Tony began wiping the streaks of tears on Steve's cheeks. "We don't have to do anything tonight, it's okay."
Pausing her hand, Natasha had to fight down the shiver the question brought. "I told I'd tell you when you're older."
“I got a call saying your father’s body was found. I’m here to pay my respects,” Bobby answered, cautiously.
"Why? Your ball and chain outside?" Bucky asked, not so subtly trying to see through the small crack in the door.
"You— you've been what? Psychoanalyzing me?" Dean's voice rose just a little, beginning to panic. If he couldn't hide things from Sam anymore, how could he protect him?
Dean threw his head back and laughed at the innocence of the question. "No, Sammy, she's not a monster. We just had a disagreement, and as always, your big bro came out on top!"
Steve held up a hand and shushed his son’s chaotic rambling. “Yeah, he is pretty warm. I’m not too happy about that, either, but it’s nothing to worry about, Sam. I promise, the fever isn’t high enough for him to be in trouble.” Carefully, the man released Dean’s hand and grasped the younger boy’s shoulders.
Dean took a deep breath to gather himself and not straight up punch the other teen in the throat. “Look, do you want to get rid of the ghost of your abusive ex step-dad or not?” he spat.
Loki sighed and began pacing the edges of the room, almost refusing to look at his brother. "Ekkert er að en þetta kemur mér ekki auðveldlega fyrir sjónir. Fyrirgefðu vanhæfni mína." {
, the onlookers concluded, and either one might’ve been correct, though they’d have been horrified to learn what the other was envisioning. Dean was opening and closing his hand, in search of the safety of Steve’s warmth, and was becoming increasingly agitated as his grip remained painfully empty.
Dean sighed and put the paper back on the coffee table where its frame waited to be filled. “Nothing’s wrong, I just—I keep wondering about what my dad would say about all of this,” he sighed, running a hand through his once styled hair, making the ends stick up haphazardly.
Tony, of course, was unconcerned for things as silly as cost, so here they were, sitting in their own private plane on their way to say goodbye to their father for good. The rest of the Stark siblings had offered to come to support them, but Dean adamantly declined, stating that they wouldn’t even know who they were mourning.
Steve took a step closer. "Bucky, it's me, it's Steve," he called out softly, just loud enough to be heard over the noise.
“Tony and I have taken care of all the kids when they’ve been sick, not to mention all the times we’ve gotten sick ourselves. We know how to help. You can trust us, Sam. Dean is in good hands, so please just relax. Getting worked up isn’t going to help anyone, including Dean.”
“I–I’m so sorry, sir! S–sorry about the mess! So sorry! I’ll clean it up! I will, sir–I promise! You shouldn’t have to clean up after me! It was my fault!” Dean was desperately trying to sit up further, intent on appeasing the man, cheeks burning red with embarrassment on a face gone white with terror.
“We’ve been here before, Dean.” The man sighed before fully entering the room and taking a seat next to the teen’s bed. “Why didn’t you call me, Dean?” he implored, his eyes begging for an answer. “You know I would’ve been there in a flash! I’ve already got the police interviewing Sam and the rest of the kids to get their testimonies. All I need is some pictures of your injuries, and we have another court case.”
"Okay, so that means that he's attached to a thing," Dean continued, not missing a beat. "Did you bring anything of his with you? Anything really important to him?"
Thor placed a comforting hand on the boy’s back. “Samuel confided in us that someone he knew was hurt. I knew it had to be Dean, but to what extent is our foster brother injured?”
"Good, good, more, god more," the genius panted, pulling Steve somehow closer and pushing himself further down on the finger.
“You want Sam to have a good and normal Christmas. You want to give him a good gift and see the happiness in his eyes as he opens it. You want him to forget about the death of your father and have a happy memory.”
Dean's face went blank, then dark as he processed the words. "Are they planning anything? Should I cut their dicks off?"
The engineer took a moment to compose himself. "Bud. Steve and I have been fighting to bring you here for four years. Does that sound like we're pretending to care?"
Sam, somewhat more satisfied with the situation, rested his head once again on Steve’s chest. He smiled when he felt the man return his arms to wrap around his son and start swaying slightly, comforting the boy.
Dean stilled as he heard the stairs creak behind him. He watched as the men sat on the couch beside the armchair he chose to perch in. Tony glanced at Deans hands, the boys nails digging into the fabric of his sleep pants and into his leg.
Despite the annoying soundtrack, the general atmosphere of the household was one of joy; everyone was exchanging smiles as they made preparations and wrapped last-minute gifts.
"May I come in?" Steve asked, hovering outside Loki's room. The teen nodded, sitting on his bed and allowing the man enough room to sit beside him.
!" Bobby didn't sound tired anymore; he sounded desperate. "If I could go back and make sure you never found out about any of this, I would do it, no question!"
Steve chuckled and shook his head. “When I told him ‘I love you’ for the first time, he said ‘ditto’ and bought me an island.” The man knew he was rambling–a desperate attempt to reduce the overwhelming tension in the room–but he couldn’t bear the broken look on his son’s face.
"Hey bud! Whatcha workin on?" Steve sat beside Sam in the library, noticing the books piled around him.
"Woah, woah, woah," Tony sputtered immediately. "Do you think Steve and I don't love you? Because, buddy, you couldn't be further from the truth."
"Thor was ready to fight everything, Bruce was scared of his own shadow, Clint was terrified of doing anything around us in case it was wrong and Nat would sleep against their door to make sure it couldn't open. Not to mention she never said a single word to us for the first six months." The soldier rested his chin on Tony's head as he spoke. "And technically we still haven't met Loki, but his and Thor's father really did a number on him."
The other boy sat there, clutching the jewellery tightly. “There has to be another way. A way where we don’t have to burn it.”
Steve smiled and nipped at Tony's lip before licking it, asking for entry. Groaning at the taste, Steve licked at the inside of his husband's mouth, wanting to memorize every detail of the love of his life. Sinking further into the kiss, he felt Tony sigh, giving all control to the blond and simply basking in the arms of his husband. Moving down, Steve began sucking at Tony's neck, not caring enough to hide the marks.
The raven-haired teen furrowed his brows in thought. “That’s why he never hurt me when I was home. It was always when I was alone in the hallways at school, or sometimes in the car.”
"You know I'd listen a lot better if you would unbutton your blouse there sweetheart. Or should I say sweet melons?"
"Who knows, we're not in his head, Sammy," the teen responded. "Now go to sleep before I smother you for keeping me up."
I'm so sorry for the (5?) month break, but life was insanely busy. But fear not! I have not nor am I ever planning of abandoning this series!!
Tony pulled Steve down to kiss him again deeply. "Good. Now, about that mind-blowing sex," he whispered, tracing a hand up the soldier's shirt, outlining the man's muscles.
"Don't play coy with me," Loki narrowed his eyes. "I saw Clint knock the vase over, but you took the blame. Why?"
“You don’t want this one? You can pick any car you want. Take a look around the garage, hell take a look around the internet, tell me which car and I’ll buy it for you,” the man interrupted, reminding Dean that his foster dad wasn’t just wealthy, but fucking rich.
"So Sam, I hear you like to read. What's your favourite book so far?" Bruce asked, filling his plate.
Ironically, the siblings' case file was the colour that tormented Natasha every second. Mr. Coulson sighed as he looked through the folder for what seemed like the thousandth time.
Retreating from his memories, the teen came to the startling realization that, between his father and Steve, he knew which one he’d rather serve under–and it wasn’t the one barking orders.
Tony never wavered as he responded, "oh it is. Feels fucking amazing. But you wouldn't know that would you? You're too young to experience consensual, passionate, rigorous, athletic, sweaty sex with someone your age. Tell me Dean. Ever got with a girl or a boy in your school?"
about you and Steve. You've got him twisted around your finger and you can't even crow it from the rooftop like I know you want to."
“Tony said they were trying to make me comfortable and convince me we were still in the 40s.” Steve explained.
Maintaining his unaffected but kindly doctor’s tone, Tony told Steve about infamous patients he’d heard of or had in the past. One man belonged to a colleague and he would mewl whenever the doctor would insert or remove the speculum.
"Don't tell me you're worried about betraying Tiberius. We both know right now he's probably knot-deep in some limp-wristed twink who’s barely sprouting hair on his balls. Come
“We can discuss trivialities later! Do you want to meet Captain America or not? Don’t bother lying to me, Criss Cross Applesauce, I’ve seen your comic collection.”
They broke things off, of course. She told him she never wanted to work with him again and Steve had calmly agreed. "I'll make sure we're not placed on the same assignments."
It was totally possible Mr. Rogers' symptoms were indicative of a more serious issue and Tony needed to focus on that–not getting his knot off. Determined to do his duty, Tony consulted Dr. Edwards and continued looking through his journals in between patients.
“Yes, thank you. I’m fine.” Steve’s face burned red, his hands still hanging in the air as he tried to figure out what his next move should be. Just then the air conditioner kicked on as if to mock him and Steve physically flinched.
They were both stubborn as mules. They were both generous to a fault and always willing to do the right thing – even if it seemed like a bad idea at the time.
Howard cleared his throat and Tony’s mouth snapped shut. Steve blinked at the reaction before recalling the manners his mother taught him. He extended his hand towards Tony, “Well, it’s great to see that Howard’s become a father. You, uh- you look like him.”
Tony tugged more, the pads of his fingers pressed into the warm soft skin of Steve’s areolas. He pushed in gently and plucked at the flesh. Tug, tug,
It was evening, the building nearly empty besides the cleaning staff and the occasional agent who didn't know when to quit. It was just the two of them as they rode down.
Tony laughed in a short huff, “Can’t be bad, Jarvis wouldn't have been smiling. He’s probably just nervous.”
“Sorry, let me get out of your way, gentlemen.” Tony moved closer to the counter and Carson and Steve Rogers squeezed by him so they wouldn’t bother the older woman.
There was a bit of sunlight streaming through the half-open window and outside, a bird whistled. Bird whistles were good. Normal. Normal sounds to hear in a normal room that wasn’t a downed airplane, buried in ice and snow.
– was comfortable when he awoke. It was only a matter of time now. He had to believe, until they could ease him into the 1990s, that he was still in 1945, give or take a few years.
“Steve…” Tony said finally, turning to meet Steve’s eyes, “It’s been a long time. Please… trust me when I say that you should eat first – get your strength up and then I will answer every question you have.”
Tony sighed. Steve Rogers needed a doctor right now, not a horny alpha who couldn't even do his job.
“Well, I think it's good that you're helping him navigate the future - just the thing you were made for.”
. Tony imagined that one day Steve would be bred and his beautiful tits would be full of milk for his pup.
“Oh… yeah, I guess so. I don’t think they’d really care that much, I’ve already got all my credits to graduate, I’m just waiting out the semester.”
them together. She'd only heard them and even a shitty PR agent could spin the story that someone had impersonated their voices to fool her.
“What the hell?” He glanced around for a moment. Steve’s room was built into an old building that Howard had bought in Brooklyn. It was cavernous on Steve’s floor to reduce any noise but the other floors were residences.
20 minutes later Tony fell asleep to the combined sounds of the movie and Steve’s deep even breathing.
Steve blinked against the light and the hazy effect that everything seemed to have. “Yes… seems that way.”
“I’m assuming you’re both in the car. Did you call Captain America hot in front of him? Is he confused about that? Does he think you’re saying he’s overly warm?”
Tony froze at the sound of the voice coming from the waiting room, the vortex of his frustrated and dark thoughts suddenly stopping.
Tony wondered what Steve liked to do. What kind of activities Steve might enjoy that Tony could happen to meet him at. Like, a movie theater or a bookstore. Steve Rogers looked like he enjoyed quieter activities. A gym, Tony snapped his fingers, Steve Rogers definitely worked out.
“Impossible.” He said after a moment, eyes flitting to take in all of Tony’s appearance before focusing on his face, “You’ve gotta be seventeen, tops.”
"He's my best friend." Steve wore a gentle smile, his eyes drifting away, "We don't always agree with each other but there's no one I trust more."
Could Steve have been in traffic? Wouldn't he have called to cancel or explain his tardiness? Tony ground his teeth.
A beautiful babe with Tony’s dark hair and Steve’s wide blue eyes. They’d make gorgeous children together and after each pup was born, Steve would ask Tony for help milking his luscious tits so they wouldn’t be so full. And if Tony took a taste for himself - well, he knows Steve wouldn’t mind.
“You’re not gonna send me to the loony bin, are you?” Steve asked lightly but Tony could see the very real worry in his eyes.
Steve graced him with a warm smile and Tony thought he could see why Howard was so obsessed with this man.
It was even easier to avoid him when she threw herself even deeper into her work, taking any assignment that appeared.
Tony shrugged, “Yeah… maybe I should check on Jarvis.” He stood up, pushing his chair back with an ungainly squeal against the floor.
Tony walked into the prepared exam room, turning to face the handsome omega. He directed Steve to undress, gesturing at the table and happened to catch sight of the dark screen of the computer. Protocol dictated that the attending physician offer to leave the room when a patient undressed so as to afford them a modicum of privacy but Tony wasn’t going to miss his opportunity to watch this perfect specimen undress.
“I’m gonna have to find a nurse or something.” Tony said, “No one’s out there. Can’t get good help these days.” He chuckled but the sound of was flat and humorless.
Tony stole a quick glance towards his father, gauging his reaction, before returning to Steve and grasping his hand, “I’ve heard. Anthony Stark but I prefer Tony.”
Steve finally succeeded at getting his pants and boxer-briefs down and kicked them off into a soggy lump. As he reached for the sodden garments, he seemed to freeze for a moment. Now that his ass was free of its denim prison, Tony could easily smell Steve’s arousal. Tony lifted his chin and parted his lips to scent the air and nearly let out a groan. There it was. Exactly as he remembered. Like honeysuckle on a warm summer breeze and an underlying note of apple pie. Tony could practically hear the firecrackers overhead or maybe distant thunder and rain rolling in. Steve shot back up, clumsily threw his clothes at a nearby chair, and awkwardly shuffled to the table, his thighs squeezed together. He gingerly sat on the exam table as he kept his head down and then grabbed the sheet to cover what looked like an impressive erection.
Howard led the two men to one end of the space where several windows looked out onto New York City’s Times Square.
"I'd appreciate it, Anthony. It's imperative I leave early today. I will send you his file. I'm not too greatly concerned - he seems to be in the best of health however, he is showing symptoms that are quite out of the norm." Dr. Edwards patted Tony's back as he passed him on his way back to his office.
Sorry it's taking me a while. I'm fighting writers block but hopefully the next chapter won't come so slowly. Hope y'all enjoy, tell me what you think!
"Absolutely, at the last place I worked, I had to be the receptionist, the medical assistant, and at the end of the day, the cleaner." Tony chuckled, thinking of when he worked for Doctors Without Borders.
Symptoms of an on-coming heat, Tony reasoned. He logged onto his computer and found Steve Rogers' file.
“Oh, definitely.” Rhodey agreed, “Takes some getting used to but it comes from a place of love. Or whatever his android heart manufactures.”
“We should finish up, lads. Mr. Stark requires Steven at the penthouse.” he said as he approached the table with an oddly cautious smile on his face.
Below him, Steve panted and squirmed on the exam table. Tony fought to keep the grin off his face, doubting that Steve was even hearing a word he was saying. “There was even another patient who used to urinate during an exam. I mean, once can be excused but twice and then three times in a row?” Tony chuckled softly.
Tony imagined Steve Rogers' pretty pink blush coloring his face, his neck, and his chest. His nipples going hard at being exposed to the cool air of the exam room. Tony wondered what his tits looked like. His plaid shirt last time hadn't done much to hide his generous chest. Even beneath the boring pattern, his tits looked bountiful, begging for hands to squeeze them, a mouth to suck them.
"I know, I know, it sounds odd but biology can be very powerful and occasionally, the body wants something without any input from the brain." He watched Steve taking in the information, slowly coming to a realization.
The sweet little nubs were probably hard as pebbles. With how swollen his areolas were getting from Tony’s massage, it would be such a delight to bend down and draw the man’s nipple into his mouth and suck
Was his relationship with Tony really worth that much to him? That anyone who stood in their way would be dealt with so callously?
She was always working. Always stopping by for a few hours before she was off on yet another mission.
Truth be told, the realization hurt Tony. Profoundly. But it didn’t stop him from looking towards Captain America as a role model, growing up – someone to be admired and maybe even imitated - to a degree.
Tony moved towards the door and Steve swung his legs over the side of the bed, “Wait- please, Howard- I’m not hungry- is- how long have I been-?”
Though, Tony could be lazy about a great many things. Selfish. Tony’s relationship - or lack thereof – with his father would also help sculpt him into a man much like alcoholic, pleasure-seeking Howard.
Tony began by showing a digital version of the basic model of an arm prosthetic. He took several measurements of Bucky’s remaining arm and hand and input the data so that the digital version changed to look like a replica.
A knock sounded at the door and the two men looked towards the door. Nat poked her head in, “Look who I found wandering around outside.”
“I don’t think anyone can remain unchanged when faced with the horrors of war. But especially one as large and as horrific as the one we fought in.”
Steve, himself, was frozen and the team initially thought he must’ve been dead. After all, who could possibly survive such an ordeal?
“Yes, Dr. Stark.” Steve whispered as Tony moved closer to him, refusing to break eye-contact. Tony rewarded him with a gentle curve of his lips and lifted his hands to touch Steve’s neck. Tony marveled at the strength beneath the skin and drew his hands down. Beneath him, Steve shuddered, and Tony withdrew his hands.
At six the local news began playing and Tony began pacing. Overhead, the storm that had been threatening all day finally broke and the rain was coming down in sheets, drumming on the windows of the clinic.
“Steve, listen, I’ll explain everything to you but first, you’ve gotta eat. You haven’t eaten… the serum can only do so much. We put you on IV to feed you - did we have that in the 40s? Shit, no- the 60s… you know what? Forget the explanations. Let me grab some food for you.”
Steve inhaled deeply and pushed himself up, catching sight of a dark-haired figure hunched over a desk.
“As I’ve already said, it’s not at all uncommon for patients to exhibit signs of arousal during an exam. No one likes to talk about it but it happens far more frequently than you’d think. I personally know one couple that got together after the omega went into heat on the table and I’ve heard several other stories similar to it. Alright,” Tony said, “I’m not seeing any signs of discharge so far.”
Later, Tony found when he’d finished with Mr. French, his next appointment was already waiting in another exam room. He hurried over and before he knew it, the day was gone and the beautiful omega, Steve Rogers, with it.
“Have we? Did we meet before…? Before the- Bucky’s appointment-” Steve frowned, the dream coming back in clearer flashes, “At a gala… a hotel?”
“No, I’m not- really sure. Dad is on the board for some other companies. I think one of them is like… security or law enforcement? They've mentioned it a couple of times but mostly keep quiet around me. Shield.”
“You're right, I never will. Can we skip the guessing game and just go to the part where you tell me and I act aloof but am secretly impressed?”
Rhodey gestured to Tony, looking to Steve, “Have you ever met anyone who can stay awake as long as he does? Either he’s part robot or he’s got major brain damage by now.”
When they reached the penthouse, Jarvis led the young men into the sitting room where Howard sat facing a woman with dark hair, sprinkled with elegant-looking grays.
Howard merely nodded before leading the two young men out of the room and into the empty space beyond, “Steve,” He started, his voice echoing, “The world has changed so much in just 46 years. It’s unbelievable the leaps we’ve taken in technology and science. I realize that to you, yesterday was 1945 and you were a soldier in a great war. That war’s been long over and the vast majority of people would be hard-pressed to remember anything beyond a few key dates of significant battles.”
"And what if I want to hurt you both?" Sharon snarled, "Tell the world that you're a cheating scumbag and that you're fucking Tony Stark."
He was perfect. Okay, he probably wasn’t. Tony knew that - as a medical doctor he definitely knew that but this man seemed to glow with healthy beauty. He bobbed his head at the receptionist.
Tony barked a laugh, and Rhodey snorted, “I have no idea. A wrestler? I'm sure there are plenty who wear the American flag on their little shorts.”
Steve garbled out an excuse about being unable to call and Tony waved it away, too distracted by Steve's dripping wet clothes clinging to every inch of him and his proudly pointing nipples.
“It really doesn’t bother me.” Tony assured him, “Let’s move on to the next part, okay? Are you ready?”
“Oh, okay, then I’ll just tell Stevie don’t bother coming over.” Bucky pulled his phone from his back pocket.
“Dr. Stark, the test results for Ms. Brown have updated in her file.” Tony turned his attention to his medical assistant.
Tony asked if Howard had built it in record time after the man had been found or if he had it built years ago – anticipating his success. His father ignored his question and continued talking about just how necessary it was that Captain America feel comfortable when he awoke.
Before long it was 5:30 and the cleaning crew was finishing up. Keisha waited until they left and took her leave behind them, wishing Tony a good night.
made the mistake, Tony. Not me!" She snapped, losing the cloying voice, "you should've just taken the job Daddy offered but
“No. I don’t mind,” he muttered and turned his face away from Tony. Tony reached out and drew one finger against Steve’s areola, not even touching the firm bud of his nipple, and was delighted to witness Steve arching off the table with a broken gasp.
“Forty-six years…” Steve breathed out, putting his head in his hands, “You’re lying. You’ve got to be lying. …
“Remind me to bring a change of clothes next time he comes in.” Dr. Edwards was packing up for the day and was chuckling about something with his assistant.
One of the medical assistants, Carson, bustled past him and pushed open the door leading to the waiting room.
Howard smiled warmly at Steve, moving to wrap an arm around the man’s shoulders, “Maybe taking some classes or settling down-“
Steve coolly met her gaze, "I suppose that's up to you, Sharon. Tony and I aren't just fucking. We're in love but it still isn't a good time for us to come out. If you're willing to keep dating me, I'm amicable to that. It's up to you, though."
Cooking with Rhodey, it transpired, was not all that different from building with Rhodey. He was laser-focused but calm, meeting Tony’s occasional mistakes and frequent complaints with his usual cocktail of teasing and no-nonsense correction. At Steve’s prompting he started assigning the rest of the team jobs, too, which turned the kitchen into a site of loud, chaotic energy as tools and ingredients moved about the space and recipes, both real and imagined (at least, Tony hoped Clint’s suggestion of a gummy-worm based filling for their burritos was not a serious one), were shared. Caramelizing onions, Tony’s primary job, turned out to be a frustrating exercise in waiting around, though Rhodey also gave him custody of one of the sharper knives and allowed him to cut up bell peppers and tomatoes. Tony was munching on a stolen piece of the former when Bruce made a thoughtful noise.
“Natasha, you may begin warming him up. Bucky and Tony, both of you are to remember your safewords, and to use them if it becomes necessary.”
“Fuck fuck fuck Steve, sir, please. ‘m ready. I want—” Steve silenced him with a kiss, all his remaining energy going into forcing himself not to wonder if he was quieting Clint because he truly wasn’t in the mood to hear begging, or because he was wishing it was someone else’s voice altogether.
“Okay. I know you’re not up for answering a lot of my questions this morning. And that’s fine, but can I tell you some of what I’m seeing and observing, and then we can decide together what sounds like it’ll be the best way to proceed?”
“I…love you too?” Tony’s loving Steve was not, in fact, remotely in question, but seeing as the man had gone and broken his brain, again, he would just have to live with any eccentricities that followed.
So that had been that. When he neared the Tower, JARVIS made contact, directing Peter to enter via what had once been the Iron Man landing pad on the roof. The second he stepped inside the penthouse, the whole space went dark as thick black panes covered the wall of windows that normally offered unmatched views of the city.
Other Notes: The chapter features (altered) references to some of the storylines in Spiderman: Far From Home. It also references some moments that are more fully fleshed-out in Chapter 11 of the Ask Strange replies.
“My last omelette took three hours to make, Rhodey, and it was still barely edible. You seriously do
The night that followed was a hazy mess of sleep, nightmares, and at least one moderate panic attack. (This Rhodey and Pepper were obviously far less familiar with the latter than Tony’s own versions, and there had been a harried conversation between the two of them about doctors or medication before JARVIS, wonderful JARVIS, had given them a few suggestions to try before resorting to more extreme methods.) But the first time Tony would have said he was truly awake and fully conscious came the next morning, when he heard the sound of raised voices from outside the bedroom door.
And because of how Dominant psychology and biochemistry works, particularly for Trues, you’re correct that their need to correct or punish is driven more by their submissive’s needs than their own particular kinks. Captain Rogers, for instance, enforced strict punishments for some violations with the previous version of Tony Stark less because he might be inclined to do so on his own and primarily because Stark himself would not feel safe or reassured that their rules mattered and were secure if given a token punishment for a major offense.
“Want to come sit with me? The other Tony made the interface simple enough that I could make changes to the obstacle course on the fly, but I’m sure you’d be able to make it a lot more challenging for them. If you’re interested.” And hell, anything was better than just staring at Barnes and wondering about trigger words and forgiveness and ignorance.
When Tony stepped into his office at Stark Industries, his chair was already occupied by a harassed-looking Pepper. There was a massive paper cup of coffee in her left hand, and with her right she was impatiently pulling the knot she’d twisted her hair into apart. (Headache, probably. The other Pepper had always let her hair down the second she’d started to feel one creeping up.) She gave him a quick evaluative stare and sighed.
“You ain’t broken,” Bucky protested, but he finally dropped dragging his heels and started actually keeping pace with Tony, so he counted it as a win. Enough to actually consider answering when there were follow-up questions. “What’d you mean in the kitchen, anyway, about not being fixed?”
Bruce learns more about the depth of Tony's submission, and Steve is reminded that caring for his teammates means more than one thing, even if they're soon to be at war.
The next minute or so was chaos. One of the Iron Legion armours produced Steve’s shield, and tossed it to him with a mechanical thumbs-up. (Not one of the Iron Legion, then. Another member of the team, most likely Natasha or Clint, had already made their way up here as well. Good.) Steve did his best to switch up his usual moves, aiming for a mix of the martial arts moves Natasha had taught him and the more generic style favoured by many of the SHIELD agents. Taskmaster met him blow-for-blow, his desperation occasionally a near match for Steve’s strength and versatility.
“Really? Hasn’t much felt like it lately. Feels like I’m the only one still..still.” He couldn’t choke the words out, could barely breathe. Bucky’s hand covered his, calloused and warm, and Steve gripped it back with all his strength, the way he never would dare hold anyone but another enhanced person.
, I won’t do to get both of you back.” She kissed him then, hard and with enough Dominance threaded through it that his own instincts rose in challenge. But by then she was halfway out of the ring, turning to peer at him over her shoulder just long enough to add, “your flight leaves in four hours.”
“I feel that way about seeing Director Rogers some days too, Ms. Potts,” Dylan confided in a conspiratorial whispers. “He’s a very kind man, but still he’s…well, Captain America.”
That was, at least, until the door opened, and a figure in a black, white, and pink costume soared through the air in front of them. Peter assumed they had been thrown, maybe by Giant Fist Girl from the video. At the speed they were going, a collision with the wall would be a painful one, and he was already moving to fire off his web shooter. He actually thought he
Ah, yes. The matter has come up. You're correct that it's likely most useful for me to show you in this instance.
Phil was still shuddering through the aftershocks of an intense climax when he felt a hand on his leg that could not belong to either of his current partners, not even with Natasha’s hyper flexibility taken into account. He looked down to find Tony in a cross-legged pose at his feet. Both Steve and Bruce were keeping careful, attentive eyes on him, but as neither seemed inclined to interfere, Phil reached down and ran his fingers through Tony’s hair; his curls were even more dishevelled than usual, and it was surprisingly difficult even in the immediate aftermath of orgasm to keep his grip light, not turn it into something demanding or inviting.
“Generally speaking, the softer, heavier tails will cause more of a thudding sensation, while those which are hard or narrow provoke more of a sting. Many Dominants will work with both during the course of a scene, because it can be hard to keep enough control over a heavy flogger for longer periods. However, that isn’t a concern of mine, and as I’m quite certain you’ll prefer this style to the other, we’ll start with the heavy flogger and keep with it as long as you need it.”
“I know this must be frightening, and that’s without even bringing in all the complexities of being in a different universe. But whoever this guy is to you, you’re going to regret not being there for him Tony. Caring for people is practically coded into your DNA.”
Morning found Thor still in rope, though the set-up was much simpler this time: just a chest harness and a cock ring. But Thor had already been lingering enough in subspace that the small push was really all he’d needed to go back under entirely. Steve hadn’t entirely planned on that one, he’d intended the harness as a kind of transitional system to move them towards aftercare. But for the first time in ages, he didn’t find himself in any particular rush to end the scene, so Steve surveyed his submissive with an almost lazy pleasure.
“Shh. You’re fine. Just enjoy it, Tones.” The next offering brought one of the market blueberries Steve had given Tony on his first morning in the Tower. Then came sips of a smoothie that Tony loved but rarely made, because it was universally despised by the rest of the team. (Seriously, what was so weird about the little kick of garlic? It gave the thing an awesome punch.) After that was hunks of candied salmon that had once been Tony’s go-to drunk snack.The experience wasn’t just indulgent, although it was certainly that; Rhodey was telling a story, a whole lifetime worth of memories, nourishing Tony with love and attention just as surely as he was through the food itself. By the end of the meal, Tony was grateful for the blindfold, which soaked up a number of tears he couldn’t quite hold back.
It was a nothing moment in the grand scheme of things. But the quiet serenity of seeing Bruce in safe and content to pursue whatever knowledge he wanted in the space Tony had built for him, for both of them, made him slightly less inclined to stop plotting elaborate escapes. (Sort of.)
Pepper seemed to recognize the signs just as well as Tony, and made to step in front of him. But Natasha spoke first.
“Finishing up a fight with some killer-owls. They should be back soon, but I can check in if it you want?” The thought of trying to watch a fight, let alone participate in one (which Steve would feel compelled to do if he actually witnessed the team fighting without him) was enough to make Steve feel queasy. If he could just get back to his own floor to sleep…the dep would be worse when he woke, sure, but at least then the team would be there. “Hey, can you grab me a blanket? Turns out winter in New York is just as freezing in this universe as it is in mine.”
“Shibari is best with natural fibres—they have more grip, and they hold tension better. If it hasn’t been pretreated then you also need to condition that kind of material to make it soft enough, and to prevent it from drying out. You don’t have to do that with the Asgardian stuff, it mostly seems to take care of itself somehow, but it’s good to keep in kind for other kinds of materials.” Tony nodded, alternating between staring at Bucky with rapt attention and toying with the rope he’d been handed. Thor shuddered, gaze fixed on Tony’s absurdly capable hands.
Tony had worn his camera-ready smile for so long in the other universe that it came easily now. He even managed a playful little wink at Bruce as he stood and smoothed the lines of his clothes, ignoring the continued ache from his groin with as much dignity as he could manage.
Then he proceeded to stare at the screen, awaiting a response like a lovesick teenager with their first crush. Thankfully, at least, Clint didn’t keep him waiting long.
Talking to a demi-god by text was decidedly odd, but even the jarring dissonance between the form and Thor’s diction didn’t mar his clear enthusiasm. No matter how many times he encountered Thor, Rhodey thought he might never get used to the way that someone who had lived for so long could remain so wholeheartedly enthusiastic about everything he did. (His Momma, he thought, would love Thor the most. After Tony, of course. Tony was everyone’s favourite.)
“I just, I couldn’t. And now they’re all going to hate me and this’ll just be another thing I screwed up.” May snorted, gesturing to the kitchen counter onto which the leftovers she’d brought with her had barely fit.
“As you’re well aware, Agent Avelino, Director Rogers undertook that action to prevent a catastrophic loss of human life. He also then participated in the cleanup, both of SHIELD and of the river, which he took time out of an extremely busy schedule to help dredge for wreckage. Can you claim to have ever, in the entire course of your time here with SHIELD, helped to fix something you single-handedly broke?”
Steve had never thought of any of it this way, which was precisely what was so valuable about Tony. He’d always been willing to ask the questions no one else would even think of, and his ability to do so seemed only to be strengthened by the fact that he had lived most of his life outside the dynamics that were so naturalized in this universe. He took absolutely nothing for granted.
Bucky calls up a holographic shooting range and gun. It would look a little goofy to watch him, crouched down in sniper pose with an imaginary gun on his shoulder, if his accuracy weren’t so damn terrifying. He is closer to the man who ripped the steering wheel out of Sam’s car than he has been in a long while.
standards thank you very much), but he knew the type. Guys like Taskmaster made their living based largely on how sure a buyer felt that they were purchasing loyalty, not just a completed mission. The second he started blabbing his career would be finished.
“Yeah, look. I did some gross and overreaching kind of stuff over the last few…well, weeks, to be honest, and I’m going to issue a blanket apology for all of it now.”
, “to get you there.” Far from hating the bench now, Tony knew with absolute certainty its forced structure was the only thing stopping him from collapsing in a heap. The cuffs and straps didn’t feel like restraints anymore, they were holding Tony steady, helping him stay good for his Dominants. “Buck, you want to take this home?”
“Eew, no. I don’t want to be up on a stage Steve Jobsing it. Let’s do it in R&D. Pretty much everything that separates the labs into discrete spaces comes down—doors, any walls that aren’t load bearing—we’d be able to squeeze everyone in there without even breaking fire codes. And the work-stations have great talk-to-text functionality for anyone who can’t hear us from where they are.”
“Not at all. I just don’t make a habit of taking notes during my closing session with a patient. I like to just listen, and take a more reflective set of notes once our time together has concluded.” Hazy as Steve’s brain was with post-engagement and holiday cheer, it took several long seconds for this to compute.
A couple content warnings for this one: MCU Tony drinks to excess in the latter part of this chapter. This won't be something that happens a lot in this verse (I imagine Civil War and the Snap as having pretty much detoxed MCU Tony from his more severe alcoholic tendencies), but if it's a sensitive area that you want to try to avoid, let me know and we'll sort out a redacted version.
“S’nice.” He wanted to say more than that. He should thank Bruce, at least, or ask questions about aftercare to put this back on the level of the theoretical. (He couldn’t. There was nothing remotely abstract about the feeling of being pressed against Bruce, being told he was good, talking about science and music and math and physics with no sense of urgency, like Bruce could happily stay there forever.)
“Submissive high. Sometimes when the endorphins from the pain of a punishment combine with the emotional release of being forgiven, a sub can experience intense feelings of euphoria. It seems particularly intense with you, which I’m guessing comes from a combination of how much crap you’ve been carrying around with you, and the fact that subtonin is still pretty new to your system.” The distant sound of liquid squirting from a bottle proceeded his hands on Tony’s ass by seconds; whatever oil or cream he was putting on smelled like aloe, and it dulled some of the harshest edges of the hurt just slightly. Tony didn’t know if he felt more betrayed by that, or by the implication that this was all just temporary, some kind of lie his brain was telling him.
And there's some excellent questions awaiting the Doctor, so keep an eye out for those over the next couple of days, too!
There was rather more in that confession than Tony had really intended to say out loud, but it seemed to do the trick. Phil stood and stripped his jeans, socks and underwear off with characteristic efficiency, folding them and leaving them on the side of the bed. Tony watched with no little disinterest. The other man’s thighs were just as phenomenal as the jeans had suggested they were, thick and bunching with muscle as he moved. His cock was long, enough so that Tony could already imagine choking a little as he slid it down his throat. Phil watched Tony watch him with something resembling indulgence, like Tony couldn’t possibly be expected to think of anything except getting Phil’s cock in his mouth at the earliest damn opportunity, and he shuddered with want and a hint of pleasant humiliation at the thought.
“Then we’ll divert some of the literal billions allotted to the Avengers to buy up some space heaters? Come on, Peter. I thought you wanting to sneak out tonight meant you were trying to actually live a little. If this is just going to be more of the same old thing…”
“You can’t go with them.” Before Tony even had a chance to agree, Coulson put his hands up in a pacifying gesture. “I know that we can’t really stop you. And please know that this has nothing to do with not trusting you, or with thinking less of you because you’re not…the other Tony. But if Iron Man just shows up in the skies again without any kind of warning, people are going to panic. Some of them might actually try to harm the team, thinking you’re some kind of imposter or—”
“What about the other side of things?” Bruce asked. “It was one thing not to explore much about Dominance when we were just talking about putting on a show, but if it’s going to be more than that then we shouldn’t make assumptions.”
Best Tony could figure, they were even now, he and Cap. Rogers had talked him through his drunken, self-pitying rampage, and Tony had hopefully stumbled through managing Dom-dep without causing any permanent damage. They were square. (So why the hell couldn’t he sleep?)
It pissed Tony right the hell off. After everything this version of the team had been through together, all they had managed to survive and defeat that had damn near destroyed Tony’s universe, and some loser who couldn’t even use the word photographic correctly had brought them to this?
“Did Clint seem like he had a particularly easy time with the punishment I set him?” Tony recalled the way Clint had looked perilously close to tears when he had finally been convinced to exit the penthouse vents, and shook his head vigorously. Phil chuckled, but then went quiet for long enough that Tony started to wonder if he had missed a cue somewhere and had managed to turn things awkward. “Honestly, outside of our work-related dynamics it has been a while since I got to spend much time in a Dominant headspace. The past couple years, I’ve been the closest thing the team had to a full-time submissive. Well, Bucky maybe, but that’s…complicated. All I mean is there hasn’t always been a lot of time for me to spend on the other side of things.” The thought of one of his Dominants not getting what he needed made Tony frown in discontent and press himself closer to Phil. (He wished he could have arrived in this universe sooner. It was a child’s wish, one oddly suited to the taste of sugar and artificial flavouring that lingered on his tongue and to the cartoon soundtrack in the background. Tony wouldn’t have willingly doomed his own universe, nor given up a second with his Pep, or Rhodey or Pet—anyone. And he was sure they felt the same about their own Tony, even about the time they’d needed to grieve his loss. But for just a few seconds, he let himself wish it anyway.)
“Alright. That’s enough, both of you,” Phil barked, digging up the very last of Agent Coulson he had the energy to project. He was gratified when Steve sat up in his seat. “No one here failed that man. JARVIS, Stane had access to your systems that Tony gave him because he trusted Stane like a parent. That is not your fault. That is not anyone’s fault except Stane’s for being a manipulative psychopath. And Steve, I know it’s been difficult to find out how many things the other Tony kept from us. It’s alright to sometimes feel angry or betrayed sometimes; I certainly do.” Steve’s bloodshot eyes finally found Phil’s at that, filled with a kind of wary disbelief. “It’s true. But in this particular case, I suspect miscommunication was the issue moreso than deliberate obfuscation. Tony knew I was aware of these events, and likely assumed I had shared them with the rest of you in detail. Perhaps I should have, in hindsight. But it never really seemed like the right time to pile past hurts on top of the more immediate ones. I am truly sorry if that was an error.”
“Well, in my estimation, you're owed both a punishment and a reward. You might not have known all the causes, but you knew enough to realize you weren’t feeling right. And you should have spoken to one of us about that Tony, that’s what your Dominants are here for. That’s a huge part of the reason these check-ins exist at all; it’s not just your physical well-being I’m concerned with. However, you were also so very good and dedicated to hold yourself back for this long, waiting for us to allow you pleasure. Now, it’s still important to me for sex not to become a part of our check-ins. So if you choose option one, I’ll decide on and implement a punishment for you, and then you can seek out a sexual reward from anyone else on the team, a temporary lift on the no-sex rule to recognize how hard you’ve been working for us.”
He could almost feel May’s relief as she surveyed the space. Really, he couldn’t blame her. The weeks since Peter’s identity had been revealed to the world had been a nightmare for everyone. It had taken reporters mere hours to find their apartment and begin camping out, and while the expensive joint legal team that Stark Industries and the Avengers had sicked on the press had quickly reduced the number of “Spider-Man’s a Murderer!” accounts. Unfortunately, there was no returning things to the perilous equilibrium Peter had almost managed to find in those few weeks between returning from Europe and his outing at the posthumous hand of Mysterio. The most he could now hope for was to minimize the collateral damage. Without Peter to worry about, May would be able to give up their apartment and move in with Happy. His building was better secured, and once the press realized Peter wasn’t with them, they would undoubtedly find the reward of trying to track her an entirely worthless effort.
“You come if you need to, sweetheart. We have all night. We’ll start back at the beginning when you’re ready, see if you can make it until you’re ready for my cock next time.” The idea of starting back at the tiny smooth dildo made Tony want to sob in desperation, and he slowed the movement of the one in his ass, trying his best to avoid his prostate and stimulate himself as little as possible. Steve growled and aborted a swing of the crop that would have landed on Tony’s hip. “Don’t you dare. You work that toy, Tony, you be good for me. If you need to come then you come, and you let me worry about what happens next.”
“Pleasepleaseplease.” They were the first coherent words he’d spoken for close to an hour, yet Tony’s voice sounded as raw as if he’d spent the entire time screaming. Natasha’s breasts bounced as her pace began to speed up ever so slightly.
It was only his years of training that stopped Steve from visibly wincing. Dynamic interactions in Wakanda functioned differently, especially in the military. While in North America it was strictly illegal for orientation-based communication to become intentionally involved in professional interactions (an attempt to eliminate any potential for workplace abuses), in Wakanda it was perfectly natural for military leadership to use Dominance in their interactions with their subordinates. They found that it encouraged loyalty, troop cohesion, and performance. And this did not mean leadership positions were limited to those classified as Dominants, or lower-level positions to those classified as submissives. Over the years Wakanda had developed methods for cross-training; the biological classification of their troops was never erased, but their practices influenced and enhanced the social aspects of orientation enough that Wakandan soldiers could serve in whatever capacity was required of their position without risking their health. (Trans-oriented activists were thrilled by the program, and eagerly awaited the day when Wakanda would release more information about its specifics.)
Tony considered this for a long time, weighing his desire for honesty against his urge to stay close to Steve, and to not contradict his Dominant. The fact that the former won out was, he supposed, a good indicator that he might be closer to baseline than he’d realized.
“When?” Rhodey asked, and everyone who forgot Rhodey was a literal rocket scientist and the farthest thing in the world from stupid deserved a kick in the face, because he was apparently already caught up. “Afghanistan?”
Keep this course outline with your class notes. You will need to refer to it frequently for important information on reading, assignments, exams, grading practices, and class policy.
Wanda Maximoff was a fatality of what is popularly referred to as the Scarlet War. Her brother, however, survived the conflict and successfully evaded capture at its conclusion.
Tony whined at the description, at the notion that the team really just exchanged notes about all the ways they knew to take him apart, and then he whined louder as he pressed the dildo into himself. It was cold, which he’d expected, but he hadn’t really understood just how completely unyielding the material would feel compared to the toys he’d used in the past. With the glass unable to bend or reposition itself, it was all on Tony to get the angles just right. No matter how he tried, though, this one wasn’t quite long enough to reach his prostate. After several unsuccessful attempts, he made a frustrated growl and attempted to reach for the next size up. Steve shook his head and slid the case out of his reach.
“He can’t handle praise or compliments if he’s not already deep in headspace. He deflects, usually, or finds a reason to leave the room. The more sincere it is, the more uncomfortable he gets. I’ve been trying to work on it, but it seems even worse with me than with the rest of you.”
“He’s aware, yes, if somewhat in denial,” Steve sighed. “Tony’s not quite as viciously opposed to bloodwork now that he's told us about the whole soul stone thing, but it still makes him extremely uncomfortable. But he also recognizes that his feelings on the topic might be clouding his judgement. So he's given me permission to speak with you. We would both value your input. And regardless,” he added spontaneously, “I think you should move fully into the Tower until this is all over. The board has already demonstrated that they're not above threatening anyone’s life, and it’s easiest for us to protect you here.”
“This is your first real time subbing, or at least the first time you’re going into it knowing that’s what you’re aiming for. I can be…demanding, and difficult as a Dom. I like to press a lot of different buttons at once, keep a sub a little off-balance. I’m in it for some of the mental dynamics as much as the physical ones. And believe me I want to play that way with you, but I don’t want to overwhelm you right off the bat. You’re better off with someone like Bruce or Phil for your first time.”
The bench was even more comfortable than it looked, and he settled onto it with none of the anxiety he’d felt when he’d been strapped down to the other one. After buckling him in, Bruce ran a slow finger down the length of Tony’s spine, a teasing echo of how he started the checkins that had to be intentional. Bucky settled into a chair next to the bench; the proximity was even more welcome for how unexpected it was to have the other man so near.
that Sam is just trying to be kind. Comforting. Most of the time Peter appreciated that about him, the fact that he hadn’t learned to compartmentalize his feelings to nearly the same extent as most of the team. Right now, however, kindness was just about the last thing Peter could bear. They’d all been treating him with kid gloves since the booze incident—hell, maybe before that, maybe since Tony had not-died.
“Maybe I was once,” Steve agreed. “But that was also always a bit of an oversimplification. I certainly had a shield, and I told myself everything I did was in defense of the people and the places I loved. That’s still true, but anyone who knew me back then will tell you I’ve also always been an aggressive little shit. I hope I’ve never bullied, or made conflicts when there could have been peace, but I like being right down there in the action. I’m naturally pretty impatient, so I like the immediacy of those kinds of results, seeing big change happen quickly. You, though…you told me that you built Ultron because you wanted a suit of armour around the world. Nearly everything you’ve ever done since Afghanistan has come from a desire to protect. To be honest I think you’re maybe more of a shield than I’ve ever been.”
Masdee, however, was not cross-trained. She was a born cat-9 Dominant who was unused to needing to prevent her extremely powerful Dominance from being woven into her praise. And even if Talia knew from briefing packets that this might be the case, it was an entirely different thing to encounter it in person. Steve was sure the only reason she wasn’t already screaming at the General was the control and stability that her recent weekend session had given her.
He arrived at Principal Morita’s office quicker than he would have liked, though it was probably for the best that Peter was punctual, given that the entire reason for their frequent meetings was to ensure Peter ‘stayed on track’ after the train wreck of the past year or so. At least Morita wasn’t so bad. He never spoke down to Peter, and his office lacked any of the cheesy inspirational posters that covered the guidance counselor’s walls.
, in that greedy, selfish, personal way that the program had tried to train out of her. She’d taken in it in a fit of temper, but she’d kept it as a totem, a reminder to herself that no matter what else she’d done, Natasha was still human enough to want something this much.
“Tony.” His name. All Steve whispered was his fucking name, but no one had ever said Tony’s name quite like that, as if those four letters contained all the truth there could be in the world. He slid to his knees again, heedless of everything he knew about how to get there gracefully, with poise and control. Steve’s fingers tangled in his hair, pulling Tony’s head to rest against Steve’s thigh. The muscles that Tony’s cheek pressed against shook with fine tremors, and he spared a few seconds to feel grateful, so fucking grateful, that it wasn’t just him, that Steve could feel it too.
“I mean yeah, but you hesitated more than with any other questions, including the ones that involved doing pretty complex math in your head. I could lend you some Jean Rhys if you want, she’s great.”
“Why?” Phil demanded to know. It would have been a rather disheartening inquiry except for the way it was abruptly edged tight with hunger. Having that kind of effect on these people would never, ever get old.
so much. He had never been known so completely by anyone before, and it was wonderful but it was also embarrassing and frustrating and overwhelming to have them so gleefully tearing his defenses away. It wasn’t fair that he felt this way, he knew it wasn’t; he'd signed up for this, after all, and every single thing they’d said or done fell well within the limits of the boundaries they’d established. Even still, they reminded him frequently of the safeword, which meant Tony could bring any of this to a stop at any moment.
Comments, kudos and questions for myself or the Doctor (#AskStrange) are always deeply appreciated. You are wonderful readers and I feel privileged to get the chance to share writing and chat about it with you!
There were not a lot of mean but non-derogatory words that rhymed with Morita. Now sure, someone else in Peter’s current position might have been worried about other things: trying to find something to say to his awkward and suspicious peers in decathlon, maybe, or even just figuring out whether the bizarre bowl of mismatched snacks in the centre of the table was some attempt at a new-agey trail mix or some kind of hazing ritual. But Peter, for whom social anxiety had long since given way to a kind of social defeatism, was mostly concerned with trying to complete the free-verse series of complaints against his principal he’d begun composing on the too-short walk from his last class of the day to the library.
His hips jerked almost violently in response, finger nearly sliding out entirely out of his hole. (Maybe just a coincidence, though?)
That wrenching sob that had cut clear across the battlefield rang out again, and Steve swayed from his crumped position as he was shoved hard enough to send him sprawling. Peter stood above him, mask off, eyes red and furious.
“I mean, I do get shot at a lot less when I’m out of all of your proximity. But I also have a pretty kick-ass concealer,” Sam fired back, lifting a bottle of beer Clint had pretty clearly intended for himself out of his hands and taking a long sip from it.
Loki shrugged in response. "It is not as if you chose the timing. Your friend has been found, you go to him. Completely understandable."
Tony closed his eyes and took a bracing breath when he read the words. "You're not broken, Natasha. You're a survivor," he explained, squeezing her hand. "Yeah, you have some trouble talking, and maybe you'll talk again, and maybe you won't. That doesn't mean you're broken, it means you're healing. And even if you do talk again, we don't expect you to be okay all the time, everyone has setbacks and it's a normal part of recovery."
"Take your time, sweetie, you take all the time you need to process everything, I'll be right here."
"Report to your cabin. You're dismissed," Steve commanded, watching the man sweat. "If I hear of you leaving your cabin before you are expressly ordered to, you will find yourself scrubbing every single toilet in this base with your toothbrush, do you understand?"
The man sighed and, setting it aside for later simply nodded and said thank you. "And that leaves you, Dean!" Steve called to where the teen was gathering things from the fridge.
When the world came back into focus, Natasha found herself crouched on the ground with both Steve and Tony sitting a respectful distance away.
“Dude,” Dean sighed. “I know that this is important to you. I couldn’t imagine if I had to do this to my dad’s leather jacket, but you can’t mean that you’d be okay with getting hurt for the rest of your life! This man already hurt you when he was alive, don’t give him the satisfaction of doing it in death as well!”
“I, for one, would not ask me how I got over my parents' death,” Tony piped up. “Way too illegal and way too dangerous.”
The man grinned, gesturing for the kids to follow him. "I have...friends. They'll pay a pretty penny to play wit' ya."
“Sam,” Dean caught the boy’s arms, keeping him from leaving the room. “You know I’ll never let anything happen to you, yeah?”
The teen paused, before admitting the truth. “I was trying to get information about our father. Sam misses him, and I was hoping Bobby knew where he was.”
Christmas Eve came with the excited voices of Clint and Sam singing every Christmas song they knew, making Natasha and Dean share matching looks of wanting to smother their respective siblings.
"That's a great idea Thor, maybe you could play a practice round with him some time." Steve smiled at his eldest while still looking at Dean. "So Nat, how was your English test today?"
Fighting gravity, Bucky slowly opened his eyes bit by bit, waiting until the room cleared up enough to actually see. It was a bland room, a simple generic painting across from the bed with the curtains drawn and the lights off.
