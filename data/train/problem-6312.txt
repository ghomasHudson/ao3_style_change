As he stared at the man in front of him now, Steve could feel the risk of that same memory crash into him again. Any second now he would blink and the face would be someone else's.
Tony shifted closer, just an inch, and Steve risked it. He could die tomorrow, he reasoned. He was already a culprit for more things than this. He would be remembered for bigger crimes than this one second of mercy.
“They’ll need a lot of time,” Steve wiped a thumb across his lips, gathering the sauce before licking it, “And a good deal of coordination.”
The feeling of disorientation was strong but he kept his eyes peeled open as the portal dragged him in, bright light engulfing the entire jet.
“Wasn’t my cooking, but you’re welcome,” she laughed and caught Morgan in one arm when the girl curled up to her, “I’m more in charge of the produce around here.”
“Yes,” Tony said and kept grinning, making Steve squint at him before poking at him with his toes.
One step of faith and a little bit of luck.
The door clicked open and he blinked away from the book he was skimming, looking up to see Tony pushing past the entrance with half-closed eyes.
The brush of lips against his made Steve blink, eyelashes brushing his cheeks, as he saw the irises of Tony’s eyes closer than he had ever gotten. Tony started to move back when Steve leaned forward and tried it again, this new experiment that felt better than he had imagined to be.
Steve removed his boots by the door and shut the door behind him, the lock reading his palm as it clicked without a sound. The sounds were coming from the kitchen and Steve hoped they weren’t making pizza again.
She nodded, the dry look calming down into a small quirk of lips. She walked towards him and patted him on the arm, squeezing lightly, before stepping around him.
"Yes," Steve answered and Tony nodded, letting him turn back around, letting the kitchen fill up with comfortable silence. He wasn't sure if there were books on this, this moment where nothing was significant and nothing changed but everything mattered more than the last. Where there was no before and after but there was
“Are we at the third point or the fourth?” he asked and Tony was smiling too, a shade too vulnerable to be anything other than true.
The focus is on the background and he can see the side profile of a woman in the front, probably close to the photographer. There’s a conversation between the woman and someone who was out of the frame, red t-shirt twisted in the movement. But the embossed words in the back, clean and simple in white over metal grey, they draw attention of the viewer and Steve traces his eyes over them.
“I’m shocked,” Natasha said smoothly and Steve got to his feet, taking a few steps towards the kitchen to try and make sense of the chaos beneath his skin.
Steve managed to shoot a weak glare but bit back the groan of pain as his entire body hurt. He didn’t need Tony to remind him of why he was in the state he was but it made sense why the man sounded exasperated. It had been just a week since his serum had been compromised thanks to the virus released by a new mad scientist who called herself Nightshade. Steve had been pulled from active duty immediately and been almost confined to a house arrest while Tony and Hank had worked furiously to figure out how to reverse the effect.
"You two need medical too," Sam told them when he came through and his eyes lingered on Steve's stance for a second before his face brightened with a knowing grin, "Or maybe you could deal with that later. Together. I'm gonna check on Reed."
"I never thought I'd say this but, I wish I wasn't younger," Tony grit his teeth as he missed the connection of the nano-virus and had to feel out the walls for the failsafe, "My kingdom for a flashlight."
“Hey, Steve? Steve!”
They spent the first anniversary of their lives as Doctor Potts and Captain Stevens battling rogue weaponized armours that weren’t of Tony’s creation.
“I just want peace,” Steve saw Tony move towards the rear of the car and took a step forward, moving till he was nearer, closer to catch the words that still seemed like a dream, “I gotta tell you my priorities though, Steve. Get back what we lost? I hope so, absolutely.”
“There’s too much to do,” Pepper inhaled shakily and pushed hair out of her face, “I need to arrange for Tony’s – there’s clean-up out there and a whole new world.”
. There might be nothing to this theory really and he might not know –
"That's the thing," Tony said as he leaned against the door frame, eyeing the older man carefully, "If you're from the future then you should know this and I'm not sure what that says about you."
Steve tried smiling but it felt like his face would crack, skin bleeding out anguish over the ease with which this woman, his friend, was wearing a new grief like a long expected friend.
They’d have more of these and then maybe he’d pull a line out.
"You said there was a threat coming?" Strange asked as he dismissed the orange flashes of light from his hands, watching Potts as the man kneaded his neck.
," he commented and Steve raised a brow at the next look, a reflected amusement in his eyes when he remembered the last time he had brought Tony food from the new joint he had discovered. Tony had enjoyed riling him up before finishing every last scrap of the meal.
"You think he's okay?" he heard from behind, a low murmur pitched for his ears only and felt the heat of Steve standing close. His fingers flew over the keys but his shoulders lowered an inch at the brush of gloved knuckles over them as his husband held the back of the chair with one hand.
Thor was standing against the coffee machine, and his eyes tracked Steve first.
"In plain sight," he realized, nodding in the direction of SHIELD agents entering the oddly situated building and waited as Tony slyly scanned for heat signatures. Tony stuffed his hands in his pockets and shot Steve a quick glance in confirmation of their target.
“Let me do it,” Thor begged, trying to reach it over both Steve and Tony, who had come up to stop him in sync, “Please. Let me do one good thing.”
"I love you," he whispered, a confession in the dark and Steve wondered why Tony couldn't hear his breath freezing in ice-touched lungs. "I love you, I'm sorry," the words were freeing and Steve would look Tony in the eye tomorrow again as a liar, safe from the consequences of this moment but he had to say it again, "I can't - I love you, Tony,
"Nobody died," Tony assured quickly, shaking his head at the suspicious look on Potts' face, "Really, nobody's dead but – well, the team split up. Doesn't this happen in your past?"
with the dotted outline of
“Why the long face?” Tony asked and Steve shook his head as the door clicked open, “Let me guess, he turned into a baby.”
Tony held on, patient in his silence as Steve reached out, an arm curling. His palm fit under the handle and the leather felt like a stitch to a part of him he hadn’t realized he had torn. The weight settled against his chest as he adjusted his hold and Tony looked away when Steve blinked down, choking down the turmoil threatening to spill over.
"Have you ever had someone crowd you up against a wall, kiss you senseless, apologize immediately after and then run away saying that they need to throw up?"
“He should have a control base,” Potts pushed at Tony before extracting himself from Steve’s hold, “Can you crack the security?”
The guilt would never be truly buried. The present could never be truly ignored either.
“We’re getting a wedding cake when this is over, right?” Clint asked and shot Tony a thumbs-up when he got the confirmation.
“Did you think about staying?” Bucky asked after a pause, gesturing with a hand at the door, “When you were in the past, in the mission. Did you think about staying? Living again a different way?”
They had talked about it six months ago, the idea of looking for the Steve Rogers of this timeline. Howard had been dropping hints for months, right after they had introduced themselves to him, but Steve had been hesitant. Finally six months after moving to New York, he had agreed and Tony had given Howard the coordinates that Steve had been found at in their timeline.
"I don't see any other Tony Stark I just kissed around here," Steve pointed out with a hint of amusement, his eyes still watchful as they tracked Tony's gaze, "Did I get something wrong?"
"Did Natasha force you into it?" he asked and leaned back against the kitchen island, feeling himself calm down with every minute that Steve clearly grew nervous. He could
“Hail Hydra,” he whispered in Sitwell’s ear and there was some part of him, some hardwired untouched idealism that curdled at the taste of the words on his tongue, but it was a small price to pay if they got through. It was a small price to pay if they got to save the real day.
He started towards the jumbo bags but paused while passing the speed balls. He could change up a bit.
“Yeah, in prison,” Tony looked down at his wrist and Steve shot him a look before copying the gesture, entering the time coordinates, “One last trip, ready?”
"You don't have your suit –"
“You burn water,” Tony said with the force of the Sahara in his voice, before turning the phone back to himself and peering at it, “And of course this needs an explanation. Everyone except me saw you like this.”
"Comms on," he confirmed and watched Potts pull himself up to his feet, "I'm not going to tell your husband that you were a dumbass if you don't tell mine what I'm about to do."
“Christine Everhart had a lot of opinions on your last words being the ones from your big press conference,” Steve scuffed his shoe against the ground with a faint smile before looking up at Tony, “Hope had some colourful words when she kept trying to get Scott to comment on things.”
“We still have options, Steve,” the cup tilted as it came to rest on the jute coaster, tea skimming the edges of ceramic before settling in and Steve could sense
A lie.
"She's a goddamn genius, of course, she is," Potts didn't bother sitting but leaned over the console to pull up a flow of data and froze pages that changed colour to a highlighted pale gold as he ran through them, "A bear nation. That's what you transcribed from her message, right? And everyone's thinking in terms of an alien species, which I get because we've seen stranger, but think again. What does it sound if you put her into context?"
Tony had gone silent as he spoke and Steve could see his jaw work, eyes diverted away.
He waited till Rhodey lifted Tony in his arms and the others gave way for the fallen to be carried home.
They floated his arc reactor on the lake and Steve stood beside the family Tony had left behind, watching his heart flow away from them.
It had finally happened. It wasn’t a joke anymore.
Natasha had squeezed his hand, her ring hitting his own, but she had stayed back with her uncle. Tony had been very specific of when Steve could return.
“Marry me,” Steve blurted and saw Tony’s brows rise, “I had it all planned and I was going to do this right but nothing went as planned so, I’m just asking. Do you?”
, he wanted to accuse.
“Hi honey,” Tony spoke up before Steve could respond, “I need you to crack some code here. Any help about where Kang’s Cube?”
“And here I thought you knew I looked good in everything, Jan,” Tony’s voice had a bit of rush, like he was running and Steve caught sight of him moving to the control room. He braced himself and threw the bot that charged at him, running as soon as his hands were free.
"Is everyone safe?" Steve asked as he made his way to stand beside Tony's seat, one hand on the chair, "We'll need medical attention, get the medbay ready. Doctor Potts is hurt."
. Nobody knew why, it didn’t make sense because Thanos being crazy could not just be it. One mad man could not have been the only reason an entire world was dead.
“But keep what I’ve found? I have to,” he continued and Steve nodded, tilting his head when Tony held out a hand, “And maybe try not dying, that would be good too.”
They held the handshake beyond what would be ignored and Tony had to pull away first but Steve curled his hand closed to hold the warmth for a second more. Years ago Tony had put his torn out heart in Steve’s hand and there was nothing left. Today it felt like trust, the same warmth but nothing similar.
Tony didn't reply and Steve savoured the silence for a minute. He didn't know what solace a reply would give and sometimes unsaid things were better relief.
“They jammed our signal,” Tony cursed as he peered at his comm, looking over at Potts with a frustrated frown, “I didn’t know you had Extremis too.”
“If I want?” Tony repeated and turned his seat around, making Steve take a step back to avoid hitting his knee, “Wait, that’s your battle-face. Why do you have your battle-face on? If I want what?”
On Natasha’s second birthday, she asked for a picnic and Tony was an absolute sucker for the idea. Howard was ready to come along but couldn’t make it on the day and that was where the mood began going downhill.
Peggy walked in and shut the gate behind her before she noted her uninvited guests, looking between them for a minute before sighing.
“Is it okay? My back is killing me,” an incredibly older version of Scott cracked his back and Steve hovered around Bruce, backing off when he was asked to.
Tony seemed to have come to the same conclusion too and Steve looked away from her when he stepped in between them, pretending to be interested in the numbers counting their floors. It did the trick though and Steve breathed easy for a second.
“Seems a little selfish,” Steve smiled awkwardly but Bernie didn’t return the smile and simply shook her head.
Steve exhaled and nodded. Now that they had hope in their hands, they had to pull themselves up again. Do it right.
“Use the other basin,” he heard from behind him and it was Tony, Steve could see him in the reflection, standing at the entrance of the bathroom. Steve blinked at the mirror and then looked down at his hand. There was a beat of silence and then there was another hand over his, tanned and warm, fingers closing just above Steve’s wrist.
"It's a headache," Tony clicked his tongue, glancing down to see Steve smooth out his rucked up t-shirt, "It goes away slowly."
He'd later label that familiarity as fear.
“Really? Because my explanation was that I was waiting for you to come up with the plan,” Tony said and rolled his eyes at Steve’s expression, “What? I proposed. I thought you should have some input in this thing too so, I was gonna let you plan the wedding.”
“Why?” Tony edged forward, ridges of his outline softening, the words coming out quieter than the question warranted, “He made it for you.”
“It’s not like that”
The water was boiling slower than the soot travelling up the sides of the vessel and Steve couldn’t bother. It was a rarity, to not care.
It went fine till Tony let the first bomb drop.
“No! No, yes,” Steve cleared his throat and watched Tony’s eyes look worried when his voice cracked a little, “I did mean yes. But then.”
He let that sink in and spoke, letting the core of the past five years come through in his words. Protect each other. Survive. Don’t give up.
They had won but Steve couldn’t measure what they had lost.
“If you don’t want me to throw up on your shoes, don’t ask me questions that’ll provoke it,” Nat replied through her teeth, smiling at Bruce when he looked back from a distance, “Come on, good vibes only.”
"Some things never change," Potts informed but Tony could hear the fatigue in his voice, knew that the man was going to lose consciousness in a few minutes at best.
“Sam, put your head back inside!”
“He was the head of Rhodey’s department,” Tony crawled in further, leaning over to the back seat and dragged out the suit bag with a cleaning label, “We didn’t really get along but I was a frequent visitor at his office.”
“Fine, that’s fine, but pick a place. Any place here,” he waved a hand out, looking between the two men, selling a pitch more real than he had anytime before, “Don’t be strangers.”
Steve had held stronger shields but this one seemed most precious. His hands finally rose from their conflicted giddiness and came around to rest on Tony's back, one cupping his waist while the other relaxed on the nape of the bowed neck.
, Tony?!”
“I – yeah,” Steve pulled himself together and looked over his shoulder, “There’s a diner I went to this morning. We could get something before we leave.”
They were at the end of the month when Steve came home in the evening and Tony was already there, sitting on the living room couch staring at the coffee table. There was an air of shock about him and Steve looked at the surroundings for a second, trying to see anything out of ordinary, before slowly making his way to the stunned man.
The view of the lake was stunning when Steve opened his eyes in a time that had been his only home once upon a time. He had landed beside the bench, a few good feet away from the spot he had left from, and Steve turned to see his old friends looking as young as he had last seen them.
The mauve keypad was right where they had last seen it, a little cracked from the force they had used to escape, but he could work with that. The sequencing had changed, a constant shift of locks that rearranged with every passing minute, and the old comfort of codebreaking set in as he got down to it.
“I’m tired of being engaged,” Steve informed his fiancé, “Well,
"Mom's pregnant," Tony said suddenly and Steve blinked in surprise at the topic of conversation before nodding.
was renamed as the Natasha Romanoff Foundation by Pepper. It rained towards the end and Steve stood in the front row, letting his uniform soak under the downpour as the honours didn’t stop.
"I will," Steve said instead and Tony swallowed back any further questions, looking up when he felt his partner's presence near his chair. He didn't remove his glasses and Steve didn't attempt it either.
Thor had sent.
Amid the flecks of white, there was a golden star falling, suspended in dying gravity and achingly beautiful to Steve's weary eyes. It was burning, reaching down for him to catch, like he could hold it in his palms and extinguish its flames. Like he could stop it from dying out.
“You honestly think this only affects you?” he asked, throwing a hand out behind him, “You think this whole madness will matter only to you?”
Tony stared at Steve for a second before he squinted.
Tony hummed and swiped the finalized code to the right, bringing up the last stream to the forefront.
“Nobody else died,” Steve commented, the pieces falling into place with slow dread in his mind, “Your choice came true but nobody else became the price.”
“Okay, okay, you’ve got the space,” Steve moved away and stared between Bruce and their test subject, “You can do this, Bruce.”
When Tony first created a new boundary, one far more closer than they had known before, they were at Gabe’s barbeque and Steve was handling the one dish he had always prided on being good at.
Steve shook his head but she mirrored it, more insistent and aware.
It wasn’t a good sign when they landed in the parking lot of a government base and Steve dragged Tony down behind the nearest car when he heard movement.
He didn't know what Potts was made of but the damned man made it to the bridge with a second to spare, feet dragging and his undersuit soaking through the blood from his abdomen. One of the suits turned towards him and Tony fired the weapons system, taking it out before it could do anything.
“Morgan,” the answer was prompt and Steve nodded, not speaking as she swallowed twice before continuing, “I need my daughter.”
"She's smarter then," Steve quipped and let his lips quirk into a smile as they approached the elevator, "You ready?"
Five minutes later they were walking into the outer compound of one of the most strongly guarded security facilities of the 70's and Steve was really glad that his pants were roomier this time. The sweltering heat was doing no favours to those in the sunny grounds and it helped them be more inconspicuous than they would normally have looked. Steve kept close to Tony and resisted the urge to lower his cap as they passed SHIELD personnel, scanning the area for any familiar faces to avoid.
It wasn’t too long till words fell on the wrong side of a conversation
“We’ll call in SHIELD,” Steve looked at Rhodey who nodded, “We won’t leave Tony alone, but SHIELD will be easy to handle.”
Steve looked ahead at the holotable in front of them and let the thought settle in his head. His hand slipped into his suit pocket and he pulled out a ring, offering it to Pepper.
"How much did
In the shadows playing between the galaxy’s oversight Steve turned, just a little and just enough to meet Tony’s smile. If he came closer, Tony would see the flecks of green in blue warmth. From where he lay, he saw his reflection and Steve returned his smile with an easier break of his own.
He could smell the lime of the freshener that Sam always chose,
The first thing Peggy had done once they had finished explaining was to walk out of the room saying that she needed four hours of rest. Tony had turned to Steve the minute she had left and mouthed a cheerful looking ‘We’re fucked’.
“I’m not sure,” Tony staved off Steve’s frown with a look, “Really. The only thing I know is that I woke up in my dad’s lab in front of the Tesseract and had to get out once I realized that I wasn’t supposed to be there.”
“I’ll have you know that I don’t consider this a date,” Tony declared, flicking a switch to pull up the tracking screen, “You still owe me something special, Captain Rogers, don’t think I’ve forgotten your promise.”
Rhodey moved and Peter was stumbling towards him, past him to fall to his knees in front of the man who had been waiting for the kid for five years.
Steve looked around to search for Tony, wanting to share this victory him and his eyes landed on Rhodey crouching over –
The agent in the elevator didn’t seem to notice much of them at first but Steve could feel her gaze linger on him, just a beat at first and then again. Any minute now she would recognize him and they would be done for.
“That was a good catch,” Hank commented and winced when Jan shot daggers at him.
Scott stared back at them in his normal form and Steve heard Bruce declare time travel a success, shooting him a dry stare before leaving the room. He needed a minute.
Nat’s message opened and it was a photo too. Steve stared at it for a second before he felt the first tendril of warmth crawl in, lips curling as he zoomed in.
"It was a routine move," Rhodey was tired, bone-deep fatigue with a throbbing ache blooming between his eyes, "We'd practised it before and everything went according to plan."
When Tony didn't respond, hand steady and poised for attack, the man wearing an older reflection of him nodded to himself.
"You finally got a shower I see," Tony replied and she grinned further, raising her brows as she caught sight of Potts' raised hand, "Yes, he's not a shapeshifter and Steve's as paranoid as you, congratulations."
"Tell you what," he said as he met Steve's eyes with an unholy grin that always led to either unmitigated chaos or sheer genius, never in between, "I think we found one."
“How the hell do any of us move on, Tony?”
It was just a matter of luck in the end and Steve left with one last stolen kiss as the mid-noon sun dried the skies.
No matter whom she hesitated with, there was always certainty for Clint. No matter whom she lost, she always had Clint.
"Good luck on your project, uh, Doctor," he wished out loud and held Tony's gaze with a knowing look as the doors closed. Sometimes he forgot the mischief that came with working alongside the man and Steve felt himself biting back a grin involuntarily.
"Hi," she eyed Steve before taking in Tony's appearance, a tension leaking out of her face as she smiled lightly, "Nice vacation?"
"A – oh," Steve caught sight of the astral projection data and Tony looked over to see the realization dawn on his face, "Aberration. She said ‘aberration'."
"No," Steve's voice was low but sharp enough to cut through Tony's frustration, making him pause to take a closer look.
“But you were dead,” Steve insisted, remembering the cold garage clearly, “I saw your body.”
“I’m going to need a strong cup of tea for this.”
“I did that once before,” Steve reminded him and looked ahead at the street they were entering, bright against his eye, “I think I can handle this.”
“You are,” Sam confirmed with a wide grin as he held out his hand for the spare helmet, dark hair sticking to his forehead, “But it’s okay. Bernie gave me her chocolate five miles ago.”
"So, where would a quasi-fascistic high security organization keep extremely confidential and dangerous alien projects?" Tony asked as he peered through the windows they walked past before coming to a halt at the end of the corridor. Steve caught sight of the familiar barracks that Tony was gazing at now and exhaled lightly, knowing the answer.
“I found people in the present,” Steve shrugged, inhaling deep, “Realized it a bit late sometimes but they were family too.”
“Before we moved to New York,” Tony spoke and Steve leaned back, noting the iron grip on the notepad, “Before you went guns blazing and exposed Zola, I met the man regularly. In the lab at New Jersey.”
Tony’s eyes closed when Steve pressed one last kiss and opened slowly as he leaned back, a wickedly happy glint in his eyes.
Time had never really been his loyal friend and honesty hadn't been his strongest suit when it came to certain matters that would lay buried more pressing issues. Steve was used to that and almost six years of practice made it easier to accept it.
They were winning.
," Steve reminded with the undercurrent of a laugh and Tony opened his fist to a palm, cupping his jaw as he saw Steve shoot him more looks over his shoulder.
"He has the Cosmic Cube," Potts looked around and walked over to Tony's holotable, keying in codes without pausing to ask, "It's like an advanced copy of the Tesseract but with a couple of other Infinity Stone traits merged in."
"Oh, this should be good," Tony observed as he picked out two juice bottles from the fridge, deciding that he didn't need the alcohol to compound things at the moment.
“Are you okay?”
"Neither do I," Tony sounded serious, a tinge of worry colouring his voice, "Potts, what are you –"
saw Captain America. I’m in full uniform with the shield. If we get caught, everything will be much worse than you’re expecting.”
"Tony, -" Steve paused and he didn't know what the rest of the sentence wanted to become but there was something to be told and he had swallowed the words so many times that they didn't fit on his tongue right now.
“The day after the funeral,” Steve nodded.
game were.
“Hi,” Steve let out an incredulous huff before shaking his head, “How? Wait, which Tony Stark are you?”
This time he opened his eyes to a blank slate of blue, a system shutdown in his mind and nobody staring down at him.
“I tried to talk to Nat,” the beds were apart, separated by a rust orange table that held the simple lamp still on. There was one more bedroom across the hall and Tony had taken it during the first few days until Steve had found him having a panic attack on the third day in the dark. The next morning they had dragged the spare bed to the larger room and they had both lived through enough nightmares to not comment on it. Simple reassurances weren’t worth over-thinking when there were losses they both carried.
“Hey, Nat,” he let the water run through his fingers and made a face at the less than completely fresh quality of his produce, “I’ll send you the week’s details in an hour. Just got to catch some dinner first.”
“We don’t have to be,” Pepper said and Steve shook his head, “Steve, you stayed in this house just because I said that I didn’t want it to be empty. You put more work into coordinating the funeral than most of us. Are you really telling me that you’re unaffected?”
“Okay, before you lose it,” Tony raised a hand when Steve turned to face him, his back facing the wall, “Will you hear me out completely?”
Steve held him in a loose hold as Tony buried his tears in the cotton of Steve’s shoulder, hands clenching fistfuls of his shirt.
“Here,” Tony said and Steve moved, following him when he dragged them over to the next wash basin, feet obeying where his eyes wouldn’t. He raised his free hand to his own cheek and Tony caught it in the other hand, shaking his head when Steve looked at him. Maybe it was weird that Steve shook his head too, maybe the tears still flowing in haphazard lines down his face were supposed be accompanied by sound. But he couldn’t think about that yet and Tony didn’t mind, he didn’t mention either, so Steve was going to follow Tony till he could make sense again.
“I figured,” Sam lingered at the kitchen and turned to eye Steve, a muted sadness in his eyes, “I heard about Nat.”
The machine worked before he could complete the sentence and Bruce counted to five, hitting the switch again at one.
, geez, platypus."
There was no way he should have had all those letters and Steve could see the smugness radiating from his partner of twenty years even as his eyes read the question again.
“She was the sacrifice,” Clint choked out and this was wrong, wasn’t it, this was a repeat of five years ago, “She was the goddamned price.”
“You’re sure about this?” Reed asked when Steve took his place in the base of the portal, the design different from when Tony had created it a lifetime ago.
He still remembered the moment he had heard T’Challa call to open the Wakandan border shields to give them time. Shuri hadn’t made it past her lab.
They were greeted by a butler when they reached the foyer and Steve was attuned enough to Tony’s body language to sense recognition, eyeing the man a second time before he realized who it was.
It probably was a cause of concern somewhere that he couldn't remember the first time they did it, but Steve didn't really mind. Maybe it was during the draining aftermath of a battle and a dingy motel room that tested Tony's patience. Maybe it was the rushed stay at a Siberian inn, packed with conked out fellow Avengers. He didn't really chronicle this well and he wouldn't get any sympathy for it.
Sam was emotional when he got the shield and his eyes widened when he caught sight of the ring on Steve’s finger. It was understandable. There had been a different world when he had thought himself unwilling or incapable of wearing it.
"She thinks I stole it," Tony grumbled but climbed onto the bed without bothering to change into his nightclothes, "I'll continue to pretend I did if you continue to ignore this."
“Tesseract,” Steve echoed, an odd thought coming to mind, “Wait. Is this because of the wish? I wished for you to be back in front of the Tesseract yesterday, is this –”
"If you bleed out here, I'm going to say your last words were something dumb," Tony gently pushed him back against the chair so he was more comfortable and pat his shoulder, "I'll make it a Dan Brown quote, I'm serious."
eyes for fifteen minutes,
“Let’s find out,” Tony straightened his back and they walked into the mansion, ready to cause yet another mess.
He focused on the audio as he took three steps forward, coming to stand in a better vantage point to watch.
“No! Stay back!” Steve stopped Thor from interrupting as Bruce yelled, power radiating up his arm in flashes of light. For a moment, for one long moment it looked like it wouldn’t happen.
“Thanks,” Steve shot him an amused look, “How’s everyone at the base? You’re doing okay?”
"I don't think this is a wise decision," Stephen commented from behind them but Potts waited for Tony to give him a short nod before grabbing his shoulder and tapping at his own chest, blue light radiating from an orb hanging on a silver chain.
“Thor, you can’t,” Tony insisted, gentle even as his hand was firm against Thor’s chest, “You won’t be able to take it.”
“She always understands me, don’t you Anastasia?” Tony shot Steve a quick look that screamed
They kept their new surnames and Doctor Potts became the roommate of Captain Stevens.
"Because this is his Uranibourg," Tony turned the chair around to face Steve, looking between him and an increasingly tired-looking Potts, "He's Picard in the situation and he's here to witness his Polaris moment. Except, you know, this time it'll cost a population to have his observation."
, he commanded his legs to work again,
His toe brushed the door’s frame before the gym opened to him and his eyes found the source of the sounds even as his ears tried to shut-out the missing voices.
Steve felt Thor at his side but there was nothing spoken, no word shared as he followed Rhodey silently, a broken march of a Pyrrhic victory.
“The only person who had the sense to not leave his work unlocked,” Tony announced, walking into the room behind Steve, brushing Natasha’s hair aside before shooting Howard a deadpan look, “If you want her to fly, we can build her something when she’s older. Do we have to play projectile free fall with her now?”
"He was my best friend," she caught Steve's elbow, fingers gentle over the suit and her eyes had sorrow but nothing could mask the warmth she felt even as she recalled their favourite man, "He will always be the love of my life. I love the life we created and every memory I have of him."
“He’s kidding,” Nat said smoothly, smiling up at Bruce, “You can’t say things like that.”
“Thanks,” he smiled at the server, pulling out his battered wallet and paid the bill with more tip than was probably expected but Steve wasn’t saving up for student loans or a roof over his head. The thought of going back to Brooklyn gnawed on his mind and the memory of staying at Sharon’s apartment hurt, but he still had some time to get there. Stepping out of the diner, he straightened his bomber and looked around for a bit before pulling his phone out. There was a message from an unknown number and one from Nat.
“What –“
“Nobody asked you to look, Tony,” he said instead and bit back a laugh when Scott rushed to assure him about it being America’s ass.
When he finally tracked Tony down, he saw him with another man who left another jolt of familiarity in Steve. Howard had never been the closest when they had been friends but Steve had lost many friends who had proven to mean more after their loss. It was strange to count Howard as one of those now but maybe that was okay, Steve decided as he caught Tony's eye and gestured at his wrist. Maybe memories were easier to navigate than possibilities.
He wouldn’t let anyone die. No more.
"He knows," Tony echoed the other man.
That was the first time she had ever come to their place and it was also the least messy stay.
"Hi," he said and watched Steve's eyes skid over his face before jerking back to the plate he was cleaning.
“I can’t, not here anyway,” he ran a hand over his face, “If I activate any contact with them before I get the Cube, everything’s failed.”
“Tony?” he tried and kept his hand to himself, coming closer till he was at an angle to see him clearer, “What’s wrong?
The jet gravitated to a docking bay and Steve catalogued three disfigured bots waiting for him as the hatch opened. He could try fighting them, try making a break for it, but he had to see Tony and his companion first. Kang had hinted that he had them, and that was Steve's primary mission.
He brought up his free hand and softly ran it over Tony's hair, fingertips brushing down the edges of his sideburns and stopped it over his cheekbone, just shy of the laugh lines that had smoothed out in his sleep.
He stared at his phone now and saw a new message alert come, Tony’s name blinking.
"I'm fine," he called out even as he heard footsteps coming closer and looked over his shoulder to see his best friend eye him cautiously, "I'm not
“What’s the situation up there?” Tony asked, eyes reading the screens at lightning speed.
“What will it take to make you stop?” Steve asked dryly as he dragged his face up from his hand, shooting the other man a deadpan look, “And what did you give Nat to make her show you this?”
Trust gained always awaited its reciprocity and Tony watched it build as his new normalcy with Steve grew. Quiet nights of backs turned with tension that woke up to legs tangled at dawn, mussed hair and beard burn carefully fixed with lazy morning routines in front of a shared mirror, stretched out tank tops still hanging from the closet that didn't hold labels of owners with old rigidity anymore - the roots sank in as their branches expanded into newer categories with passing seasons.
“Remember the friends I told you about?” Steve asked Peggy and watched her recollect the ones he had mentioned, “Well, turns out ‘dead’ isn’t an accurate verdict for all of them.”
"You ready to wake up yet?" Steve teased and Tony cracked his eyes open at the smell of coffee, rolling around to see his husband crouched on the bed with a breakfast tray beside him.
“You don’t have to be,” Tony said and Steve looked up to find him giving him an understanding look, “You don’t have to be Captain America, Steve. You weren’t that for about seven years but that didn’t stop you from being a hero. From helping people. This is just a chance to do the same thing again, with whatever title you choose.”
“My second chance,” Tony completed the sentence, his smile wan, “I was pretty specific when the demand came. The choice had to be mine, affecting me. The world in the balance and the only thing I could match to that was my desire to be with my family. The deal worked, and now I can’t go back. Not to any timeline where either of them are my reality.”
“I will answer reasonable questions and excuse you the assumption that I cannot call you without being told to do so,” Pepper reminded him and Steve made a face but nodded.
"We've got an incoming signal from the deep-space scanners, and Reed says he's detecting another time portal," she quipped, an amused look falling onto her face, "Is the other Steve a ‘punch first' type too or can I get Stephen to make him some tea first?"
Tony took a breath and made a decision. One step of faith, that's what Potts had said.
It was probably worth mentioning that they were currently fending off attacks from the Hydra soldiers they had unearthed from the latest bunker raided and Tony was trying to get the Avenjet to work after they had taken a hit.
“Don’t ask, won’t tell,” Steve said dryly and the other man made a face before looking up at the building, “You ready?”
Tony looked at the floor and around their feet before zeroing in on something that made him smile slowly.
Scott didn’t really understand the silent and half-spoken conversation they were having but he raised the concern of making an additional trip with their limited supply of Pym Particles.
Well, a chosen reality he supposed. Just as real as the fact that they were here, working together again.
"You never told Reed anything, you just said my name and vanished," Steve corrected him, looking out the cell to see the bots stationed as guards, "And I've seen worse."
"Is it," Potts commented lightly even as he eyed the pendant on Strange's chain before looking over at Tony, "Did Steve reply yet?"
She was pushing, ahead and above, into any direction she could to keep kicking.
It was sheer luck that he didn't encounter any additional issues on his way from there on, and Steve kept a low profile in his delivery uniform. It was fairly easy to find an unoccupied room with a phone and Steve rummaged through the phone directory taped to the wall to find the extension of Hank Pym's lab. If he played it vague and used broken information from what Tony had remembered of Project GOLIATH, it wouldn't take long to get Dr. Pym out of his lab and running for the basement.
“Tony, we’re at SHIELD. About 30 years since they last saw Captain America,” Steve continued steadily when Tony’s frown deepened, “And some of them
"We fight back, Steve," she was trained out of showing desperation but time had found a way to teach her the same again. Her fingers clenched and unfurled half-way into fists at her sides but she wouldn't step away, holding on to Steve's gaze. "It's what we always do. I know it's - rough now but we can - we need to keep trying."
“Tony,” Steve wanted to curl into himself, retreat, run till he wouldn’t have to face this because this was a test wasn’t it, was a rotten temptation, “I don’t know about this.”
“Ross called for your head,” Pepper answered him before Steve could finish the question and the air felt punched out of his lungs but she shot him an understanding glance, “Yours and Natasha’s, really, but he was very insistent on yours.”
They were fine. It was not awkward.
"Hi," he repeated and felt Steve's exhale, a soft expansion of undefeated lungs, lungs that had brought him to Tony from the ice.
"Get your man out of here," Potts rolled his eyes at Steve but nodded when he got a concerned look, "If you two do your jobs, I'll get back to my own worrywart soon. Don't worry, he's pretty picky about me dying and I have no intention of ruining our anniversary plans."
“We should go visit them,” Steve said an hour later, handing Tony a glass of water, sitting down beside him as he watched the man drink, “We can’t stay in New Jersey forever.”
"Yes, Anthony," he replied with an emphasis on the name even as Tony heard the momentary shake in his voice that a stranger might have missed.
"What does a second chance feel like?" he asked and his words would choke him one day, too many stuck to his throat and the roof of his tongue tasting like regrets, like wishes. "Can we get more than one second chance?" he wondered even though it felt like a plea, a request to someone who couldn't grant it. Wouldn't? Maybe shouldn't.
Steve wasn’t sure about that but he figured that it was worth a shot if it made the kid happy.
“We leave in two hours,” Bucky shrugged, tensing a bit before sitting down on the settee, facing Steve with assessing eyes, “You don’t look so bad.”
"You know, the other day," Tony said as they walked over to the barrack's door, briefcase lightly swinging in one hand, "Morgan said the wildest thing."
He put the photo were it belonged and walked out, hoping Tony had escaped too, his eyes sharp as he made his way to their agreed spot.
The blinds were no wall between the past and the present, but all Steve could do was stare as Peggy read through her file and argued with her subordinate. There were no words escaping the clog in his chest, the lock in his throat effectively holding him back as she left.
They watched Rhodey fly back to the home in the woods, Pepper right beside him, and Thor shot Steve a look before following them.
She had balanced two over her ear
“Did you do your laundry?” Pepper shrugged with an easy smile at Steve’s look, “Just wear a shirt. That’s not the problem, Steve. The problem is that you’re a –“
“We need to have Natasha’s funeral too,” she said after a beat, rubbing her palms on her arms, “We’ll plan one for her too, she should have one.”
It had once made Steve uncomfortable, the promotion of the place being done based on his creation, the disturbing objectification making him want to cringe at times. However, he had seen worse by now and thought this negligible to some things that were branded into his memory as much more embarrassing.
“I was out for three hours,” Tony shot him a death glare, “Three hours, Steven.”
And they had hope.
“It’s been six months,” Steve raised his hand to scratch his neck and dropped it midway, “We got engaged and then nothing happened. Nothing. Not a discussion of where the wedding should be, how, when. It’s just - neither of us is popular for our patience and it’s like we chose this topic to be crazily patient about. So I thought, well, that maybe you…forgot.”
"- and I didn't want to," Steve completed, letting the pause in conversation stay as he tested the wall's corners, "Okay, we need a new plan. Any ideas?"
He had no guarantee of it playing out the way he wanted it too but it was too obvious, right there as an option and Steve took it.
“Somewhere underneath all that,” Tony eyed the mess that had once been the facility and Thor came up to them, dusty and bruised but still alive and looking angry.
“I’m almost tempted to hear the joke,” he said before meeting Tony’s eyes with all the certainty, all the courage that he could muster, “But I think we can save it for later. You have a better suggestion at the moment.”
And wasn't that on the nose as always?
"He left for SHIELD at 6 a.m," Tony answered lightly and felt a hand on his shoulder when he looked at the holograph. It wasn't bad and he was fine. If he had been repeating the same thing to himself since morning, well that was between him and his brain.
“So, did you like it?” Rhodey asked from where he was busy inspecting the upgraded armour, head buried under the opened torso.
With Tony, Steve was lost. Had probably always been or maybe had chosen to be, just so he could avoid the rushing realizations that would come with clarity.
One more try and they were staring at a baby.
Steve knew what the stipulation would be and it was ironic how he could finally read Tony right after having read things wrong for years.
Now as they both stood in front of Steve, Okoye at their side, he let the hope run through him and the echoes of a thousand warriors followed.
“Your baby,” Steve echoed and was this his world, was he in the same plane of existence as he had been on the couch, “Your – I’m sorry, I think I’m missing something.”
“How did you get here?”
"Really, because you can't handle it
“Hi,” Tony patted Steve’s shoulders before letting go.
“Besides,” Tony shot him a wry grin, “I have to get this out of the garage before Morgan takes it sledding.”
Steve didn’t comment when Tony tossed him the keys and let him drive, taking the offer as they rolled out of the guest house. It would have been faster to take a ferry or the train but they were both alright with taking the long way around, letting themselves have some extra time to sort their thoughts out. Tony put the radio on and changed the stations till he stopped as a newly joined Mariska Veres began crooning an ode to
“Slacking off on me tonight?” Steve rested his chin on his own shoulder, body half turned towards his right and Tony caught the fall of a blond lock brushing his forehead. The grass was soothing under his feet and Tony pulled up his knees to rest his soles firmer against the ground. It was nice, comfort both under him and directed at him from a gaze of old familiarity.
"It's okay?" Steve answered and Tony felt his smile bloom, a loose laughter rattling between his lungs.
"Because you threw up," Tony nodded and looked up again, watching Steve's lips quirk to the side a little, just a kiss shy of sheepish.
citrus, no matter who made the rounds to the store. It was a habit to always ask Sam and the answer was the same.
“I was hoping you’d help me patch some things up,” he replied and saw her eye him for a moment before eyeing his wallet. She turned around without a word and walked out, leaving Steve standing alone. When she came back, Steve frowned a little at the box in her hand, catching it when she threw it lightly.
"Why didn't you get back-up?" Tony asked, and Steve frowned as he wondered the same thing, "Doesn't your team have any – oh come on!"
Tony swiped at his screen once more to copy the data onto Richards' work screen. Minimising his own, he blinked away the strain building in his eyes as he rolled to his feet. He felt sweat along the back of his knees as he stretched his legs and winced as his soles pressed against the ground. His plantar fasciitis reminded him that heels were the bane of a body. It was bad enough that he couldn't use a flying armour everywhere. It wouldn't be a problem if somebody just got him some ice and a week's rest.
When the other Avengers were called in through video, they looked confused for a minute.
The burning battlefield got smaller as they took flight and Steve turned away as he parked his bike, grimacing at the grime on his face as he removed his helmet. Tony was still flying the jet but switched to the AI mode when Steve walked towards him, turning his face to cast a casually fond look over his shoulder.
Tony looked up from Natasha and his smile turned dimmed into something less than cheer for the sake of cheer. It shortened into something more Tony, a contrasting shade between home and an ever-present inner war.
"This is what you get for not using my comms, you – I'm going to strangle you, I swear," Tony knew he was losing it but his adrenaline was a mess and he really needed his partner back right now, "Cap, say that again. Steve!"
The elevator opened a floor below the penthouse, Natasha and Clint's floor before they had left, letting Tony out into the stillness of no visible threat.
Some people spoke to mirrors with an imagination of a future’s dream. Steve spoke to a figment of the past with ease that came a little too late.
Till there was even one of them standing, Thanos hadn’t won. Till there was one person against him, Earth hadn’t lost. Steve was the last man standing and he dragged his feet, walking to meet the army head-on.
Steve was moderately mollified when young Hope found her way into Tony’s car and ended up spilling juice all over the backseat.
It figured that their last truth had been a lie. It figured that this was her turn to not come home.
“It was her birthday three days ago,” the words should have been empty, probably would have been a few years ago but Steve had more control now, “I think at some point I’m going to have to learn new birthdays, find new days to celebrate. But still – it was hers this week and I guess it’s not over in my head yet. I painted that scene from the park.”
“Nat,” he started when he opened it to see the thread and needle, “I – uh – I think there might be something – you know what, thanks.”
“Did Pepper not have a bouquet?” Steve asked and smiled as he noted the sad face drawn on the balloon. It had to be Jan.
“What do you want me to say?!” Tony demanded, eyes blazing, “I had to choose between letting them die, letting everyone die or make a deal to save the world! It was a desperate choice, Steve!”
He let Sam take his cap as a parting gift and watched them leave, briefly wondering how more people they would bond with and band with in this new journey. With a few beats spent thinking about new friends, Steve turned to move on, climbing back onto his bike to see where the road led him.
More alive. Purposeful.
He could still look Steve in the eye without wanting to throw himself out the nearest window and Steve could still hand him a screwdriver without telling him in a creepy tone that he wanted to test if his ‘screw’ would match Tony’s ‘bolt’.
“You make a fuss when I sit in your chair, Steve”
It was what he could do when he thought of Sam, he’d decided. He hadn’t planned on bumping into another Sam in the whole deal.
There were also different, much more than they had anticipated, and it came up in the most unexpected ways.
But they had both seen more generations than anyone should have and there were more memories of death, real and unchanged, than this scare that was being treated.
"- and he's particularly targeting you because of me," Steve said, dead serious as he held Tony's gaze, "No matter what I thought about Extremis, it was yours and he targeted you only after I came. He's going to fight me, Tony, but he's going to kill you."
He nodded and she hovered up just enough for him to hold her hand before pulling him away, the air whipping against them as they flew. He had never flown to Tony’s house before, hadn’t been there more than the one time they had ended up having a tense lunch. They had driven Nat’s car that day, too engrossed in their adrenaline to enjoy the view of the drive.
fun letting the road take them on again and he continued their journey.
“You called him?”
threaded in a paler blue.
“There’s this line in a John Cale song,” he spoke, the phone at his ear and a falling sun covering the sky in yet another goodbye, “It’s called Paris 1919 and the line goes
"Potts? Hey!" Tony called out even as he focused on the view ahead, crashing through the place without a second thought, "Fuck, hold on. I'm going to bring you back to life and kill you myself if you die on me now. Do not make me face your angry husband when he invariably comes looking for you."
The one he had chosen now was plain, dark framed and clear glasses. It didn’t match his style, not the old one at least, but the frame still sat over his nose. A new mask in place.
He was reading the book he had put off for years now when Natasha knocked on his open door, leaning against the frame in her dark jeans and grey hoodie.
"This is Steve Rogers," he called out, recognizing the audio link being active, "Commander Rogers from the Avengers."
Steve thought with a growing beat of excitement and acceptance echoing alongside his heartbeat,
“You couldn’t live with your failure.” Thanos said, and Steve hefted his shield tighter at the detached curiosity in his tone, “And where did that bring you? Back to me.”
"We were extremely decent, thank you. No paparazzi, no sex tapes," Tony replied, eyes running over the last error.
And there was an entire world out there that had lost life, lost family like limb. Loss was supposed to be their history, their single largest chapter in the book. But it was supposed to be over. This was the next chapter. This was when they won.
Later he would remember the brown sludge sloshing around in his glass, the scent of baked potatoes lingering when his hand caught around the elbow of a Henley. On another day he would think about red butterflies on Morgan’s pajamas and the pale blue bunny that lay on the settee, recollect the three turns of a silver ring with every skipped conversation point in a tense family lunch. There would be flashes of a white paper-mache mansion sitting on a kitchen mantle and a purple eye mask stuffed in the apron hanging on the fridge’s side.
“I never said it was a fair choice,” he said after a while and Steve refused to look at him, staring down at his own hands as he leaned against the wall, “I know you don’t agree, I know why and I don’t expect anything lesser from you. It’s a good thing, really. But Steve, if I have to choose between my kid getting to have a life and me seeing my family for a few more minutes or however long it would take for the balance to collapse once you drag me back – if that was a choice, I will always choose what I chose. Is it cruel? Maybe. Is it selfish? Absolutely. Will I still make the choice? Yes.”
“It had to be the one thing I valued most,” Tony looked old, much older than he had before.
“So what has changed now?”
“Was. Now it’s different,” Steve declared, “Let’s get married.”
he wanted to explain.
“If we’re going to do our best,” he quipped, “then we should do it from the place we do it best.”
“He must be laid to rest,” Thor said and Pepper looked at him before turning around to see Steve.
"We won and everything is lost. What else do you call the truth?"
for the Shocking Blue. Bruce had introduced him to the song once, during the early times of getting to know, and it had been his ice-breaker. He had spent fifteen minutes talking about why the song mentioned ‘godness’ instead of ‘goddess’ and his fascination with psychedelic bands before stopping to ask if Steve was bored. Tony had barged in then, coming from a meeting with Fury, and had answered for Steve whatever he thought fit.
Nat had tangles in her hair, a smear of peanut butter on her upper lip and a lifetime of tiredness in her eyes but she smiled softly and Steve shrugged.
“Four years ago,” Tony replied, no trace of hesitance or guilt on his face, “The night before Natasha’s second birthday.”
But sometimes lying kept you alive and Steve had lived, as his support group would testify. He was there. Present. Moving.
“Bruce, bring him back,” Nat chimed in and Steve threw his hands in the air at the madness.
"He'll find a way to Jane Foster and her knowledge of the Aether," Steve took a breath and his eyes cut over to Tony, an unspoken understanding passing between them as they took in the implications, "He's going to rewrite history. His codes must be linked to this."
he decided but the screen cleared and Tony was still there, this time hunched over in a cellar clutching at his chest.
“Steve, please don’t tell me there are more time-travellers dropping in,” she looked at Steve exasperatedly before turning to Tony, “Who are you?”
The freestanding bag wasn’t her usual choice of workout but some days weren’t purely exercise as much as the need to exert. The leather was reinforced for the superhuman opponents it faced but he could make out the indents of fists and feet slowly beginning to set in as Nat went at it without relief. Hit, kick, thwap of an arch, precision didn’t let up as Steve watched her let practice flow through.
It was a fragile peace that had been earned and built with painful care. Steve respected that. He was simply lost himself, in footing and misplaced feelings.
was signed at the bottom right, white against the dust.
“I would offer to make you dinner,” he announced and Nat looked up, taking a sandwich from the plate on her table, “but you look miserable enough already.”
“Sounds like a deal,” he agreed and Tony grinned, eyes crinkling in an undecipherable emotion that Steve would have dared to call affection with anyone else. With himself, Steve wasn’t sure what it was, how a language would describe the puzzle that came in misplaced pieces between them. There was a ballpit of emotions that they always fell into, diving headfirst, bruised knees and oxblood tears. It was always one of them chasing the other, one of them escaping the other.
say?”
“Fuck,” Steve felt the word expel from deep within him, his hands shaking as he brought one to hold Tony’s head close and the other curled over the center of his spine. Tony patted his back hard once, twice, and then rested his hands curled around Steve’s shoulders. Steve swallowed hard before loosening his hands, pulling his arms back and took a step away to see Tony clearly.
Of course.
There was a watch, Tony’s rings, and some coins that Steve had kept on the bedside before leaving, and it was the only companion to them as they rested. A time, change, and two memories.
Peggy looked like the woman he had loved, the woman who would remember him without intervals of blankness.
"You're hunting us for something that hasn't happened," Steve heard Tony call out to Potts to be careful but kept his attention on the tyrant before him, "I'm not the Steve Rogers you're looking for."
Natasha grinned and buried her face in his neck, tiny arms curling against his shoulders.
“Now, yes”
"The idea of me was," he replied and quietly kept watch of those who would spare Tony a second glance as they passed. It was the beard, he knew, but it never hurt to be a bit extra careful at times.
“Tony? What’s going on?”
“Can we switch now?”
“You did,” Steve pointed out and wondered if Tony could hear the soft spot in his voice.
“We are,” Tony’s eyes bore into his own, an assessing gaze, “getting the rest of the team. Right?”
. Last week Joe, the guy in my group who says he waited too long? Well, he said that line reminds him of his life of the past five years. It was a nice moment, he’s been in the group for a month now and this was his first hint of acceptance. That’s what I – I mean, I think that’s what it is. Everybody nodded and smiled sadly. There were a few tears too. But my eyes kept going to his hand that wouldn’t keep his phone down. We don’t have a rule about it, not really, but I couldn’t stop wanting to take it out of his hand and putting it down somewhere.”
He had no idea what Reed meant when he said that a time-travelling Tony had come to take away his own Tony but he was sure of one thing – this would not end well for the other guy if he didn't get Tony back in one piece.
“I think I might have a name,” he said, looking at Tony with a smile before folding the paper, “Thank you for the gift, Tony.”
That was when Tony got his glasses and Steve remembered a time when they had shielded him from those who would use the faintest vulnerabilities against him.
“Pepper –”
"Right," Steve got to work, the grunts and hisses from Potts telling Tony that he wasn't winning the battle against a focused Captain America, "This will go easier if you pipe down, I'm just saying. It's like Clint and you combined here."
They moved into a Manhattan apartment on a warm summer day in August and Tony signed up to work with SI as Steve joined duty as a SHIELD agent.
“Morgan and Pepper were fine,” Steve heard himself from a distance, the thoughts becoming clearer faster than his words could come out, “And you’d said – earlier you had said that you couldn’t risk –”
When he got back to the hospital, Natasha looked up from her chair and her eyes came to see his empty hands before smiling up at him.
"What're you talking about?" Potts frowned and Tony saw the man's eyes go to his hands, frown deepening at the lack of rings, "Who died? Did someone –"
"I missed you," Tony said because he could, and because he wanted Steve to know. Steve's smile deepened and Tony raised himself on his toes to press his lips to his forehead, soft and full and slow. He heard Steve's breath skip a beat and held himself there for a moment before lowering himself down to the eyes. Steve watched him, a blink of heartbreaking silence in his chest, before he closed his eyes and let Tony press his lips against his eyelids. Right. Left. Between the brows, until the creases smoothed out. Steve huffed out a laugh when Tony kissed his nose but Tony could hear the swallowed love when the laugh was wet. His palm held Steve's face as he closed his eyes and kissed the cheeks, soft and real, taking his time because this was theirs.
“We’re not made for schedules apparently and I’m okay with being impatient about this,” Steve quipped, leaning forward to almost touch Tony’s forehead, “I want to be your husband, Tony. Let’s get married.”
“In the Avenjet?”
“So what’s your plan?” he asked, eyeing Tony’s clothes, “Go as Howard Potts and what, work at MIT in a time when you weren’t born? With no resources or actual connections?”
“How’s the head?” he heard from his right and winced when his neck hurt as he turned to face the source of the voice.
Tony should be calling for Stephen or Reed at the least, but this was the most bizarre yet fascinating threat he had faced in the last couple of months and he was kind of looking forward to it. He wondered when he began having preferences in threats but put that aside as he lowered his arm.
“Apart from walk in, steal the cube and a couple of vials before getting the hell out of here?” Tony nudged him back with his shoulder and Steve leaned back, shifting further when his companion turned to face him, “Haven’t considered one yet. You?”
Steve’s foot stepped on something as he walked and he looked down, lifting his shoe to see a silver band. He bent down to pick it up and recognized it to be a size smaller than Tony’s, a solitaire sitting elegantly with an engraved wing on either side. It had dirt from his boot and he wiped it, running a thumb over the band one last time before folding it in his palm.
“How?”
“Good luck!” she called out and Steve huffed on a smile, staring down at the box before sitting down at the nearest chair. He considered freshening up first, getting a shower and change of clothes. But the wallet was right there and he shifted his jaw, nodding to himself before picking up the tools.
The Tower was bereft of its usual chatter with half the residents absent and nobody cut his path as Tony made his way up to the penthouse. He could do a quick stop at the kitchen and pick up a smoothie or one of the –
It had been a long time since they had helped each other directly and the idea of being late to restart that habit soured in his throat.
They were placed in some dark setting, the lights flickering behind them, and arches of stone visible in the corner of the screen. It looked like an underground bunker or a dingy dungeon.
“What?” Steve turned to Tony but his husband was already walking forward, an intense focus on his face, “My phone can’t work in intergalactic networks, Tony.”
That hadn’t stopped him from getting annoyed with Tony and break out of home in a fit of stubbornness though. He would have gotten away with it too if he hadn’t attempted to take on a bunch of bank robbers on his own and gotten thrown into a tree as a result.
“Then why does it need an explanation?” Steve sipped the dark green mix and was surprised when it didn’t taste bad, a hint of mint coming through the other greens, “Not bad.”
It was the last thing on their minds when they had left home for the mission. The anniversary planning had been circulating in confusing whispers and Clint had perfected the art of riling Tony up to new heights of extreme ideas while the latter's husband pretended to ignore the madness.
