Perhaps he and Dean will stay friends. Perhaps Castiel will live in a little house with a garden. Jack will grow and learn and have a life, and live it, be able to live it. Cas will see his friends and be thankful for the opportunity to be, to find, to practice and create his own happiness. Whatever it might look like now. Castiel is lucky, so lucky, to be in the world, a world of such broken beauty. This is the world, he is in it, it is beautiful. The rain comes shivering down, silver against the inked blueblack of the sky. It thrums at the ground like fingertips on the skin of a drum.
The living room is set up in pretty much the same way it was the day of Jimmy’s funeral, except now there are fewer people. Ellen spots Anna and immediately sits down in front of her, squeezing Dean’s arm comfortingly before she does so by way of farewell, and, Dean guesses, encouragement. Dean smiles awkwardly at Castiel.
“—And you—” Dean can’t breathe, he can feel tears streaming whitehot onto his face, but he’s barely conscious of the moment he began crying. His hands shake. There’s the chiming in his head again—but no, now it’s not chiming, now it’s pulsing, now it’s pounding, pounding like the feet aiming kicks against his body and face in a piss-stained alley, ready to leave him for dead, and they didn’t stop, and the pounding won’t stop, and Cas is stepping closer to him and Dean shoves him away, terrified. “Don’t touch me!” He shouts. “Don’t touch me! Get away from me!”
“This,” he said, and Michael frowned down at it. Asmata, beautiful and glimmering as the starlight. “Use this. It is more than worthy. It is worthy of you, worthy of—” he cut himself off. “I had always intended to give it to you—eventually. Well. There it is.”
“You,” Castiel replies, words soft. Dean pauses, taken aback. They face one another, legs on and off the couch, limbs curling, only a few inches away from one another: a few inches closer, and they’d practically be on each other’s laps. Castiel is finding it harder to see a reason why they
“Anyway,” He says, “I wanted to let you know, I’m grateful. And, uh—best of luck, in your new home. I guess this might be the last time we see each other, for a while, at least?”
, earlier, I mean." Sam's hand had clenched into a fist. "He stomped that out of you. Made you hate who you are. Dad— dad was a homophobic asshole, Dean, I know you idolized him, but he was just-
Chuck's angels gardened. They trimmed the rosebushes and watered the hydrangeas and pulled up tiny weeds. Nine crowded around Chuck's tiny television and watched the news. One played with his orange kitty with a tiny feather on a stick, laughing as the paws swatted at it. Some liked to walk around the neighborhood when they got bored and secretly garden and touch up the neighbor's front yards, too. Four drew with chalk on the sidewalk. Some angels actually put Chuck's mattress-room to use and napped like cats with their arms around each other as the windows cast rectangular spots of light across their bodies, chests rising and falling as they tried to dream anything but nightmares.
Every day, every day of his life, he was told what a precious and rare thing he was, a marvel, his mother said. She said not to feel jealous of Michael for being the older of the two of them, age was nothing, she said, when in the face of Lucifer’s wonder. He was the most gifted fighter of anyone his age—and even several years older—in all the Heavenly Realms, she said. Of course there was little point broadening qualifier to all the Nine Kingdoms, Angels being all things faster, braver, stronger, than Humans and Demons. She said not to feel jealous of Michael being older than him, by an insignificant fraction anyway, she said, and went out of her way to show and say that Lucifer was destined for greatness and awe. He was a wonder, she said, and he would show it to the world.
“Dean,” his hands are, in the next instant, cupping Dean’s jaw and tipping his head up when Dean tries to bow it to the ground in shame. “What’s happened—what—” his expression turns from cracked with worry to dark with protectiveness. “Has someone hurt you?”
So I knew when I started writing this that it'd be one of the slowest burns in history, but like... wow. I've gotta say wow. This is the slowest of the slow. Anyway, if I haven't already told you, Cas's big reveal will be coming in chapter 59, which is pretty soon, and I'm about to start writing it. Just so you have something concrete to hold onto :)
“I don’t know,” he shrugs, glancing back at Dean, who is now staring at the floor. “I think I quite enjoyed his response.”
“Lavender,” he smiles, the expression twitching at his features, and it twitches at Novak’s too, though he looks at Dean like he’s some odd and unknowable creature. “Smells like lavender.”
Cas stayed to clean up the mess Dean had made without complaint, gathering all the pencils and pens and clumping together the dozens of balled-up pieces of paper. The library looked like a mess- it had been a while since he'd been able to organize it for them. He might as well start again.
'Red' must have been low on energy and sleeping. He finally squirmed a little in Cas's arms and let out a few little coos, finally opening his eyes. A deep, matte blue. The color that could deepen to green or stay the same, it was hard to tell.
Sam's heart wrenched in his chest. "Hey, baby, don't be embarrassed." He put a gently hand on the stacks of four wings, and Bobby cried even harder.
"You won't, Cas." Dean quickly replied, but he couldn't help but have a bad feeling in the pit of his stomach.
Dean finally managed to put the four babies to sleep, and he was exhausted as hell himself. They were both "teething" and "winging" at the same time and all of them were uncomfortable and cranky all the time now. Dean was put on teething duty and tried to have them gently come out of their tantrums as he gave them little toys to gnaw on.
"Because you saved an angel's life and you're housing him, even when it hurts you. People find it commendable." Cas leaned his shoulder onto a space on the wall next to the mirror.
Cas looked disgusted as he wrinkled his nose a little bit. Dean had go smile. "Not so glamorous, I get it."
The brothers waited on the porch, watching as Cas talked to Chuck sitting at that wrought iron table in the middle of his backyard-turned-garden.
Tobias held the arm outstretched and fumbled with the bandage, finally unwinding it and revealing the deep and vertical reddish-purple line of crusty scrabs and tender skin. A small, concerned frowned pulled onto his face. He said nothing as he rand his hand along his forearm and the ugly scar disappeared.
"I don't have a fever." Dean said, looking up at him in confusion. "I feel fine. I really want to get out of this
Baby Leo was strapped to Cas's chest in what used to be Eggy's baby carrier. Chuck smiled at Cas and then his eyes flicked down to the towheaded baby's round face. Leo's blue eyes were widened as he looked at Chuck with wonder, tiny pink lips hanging slightly ajar.
To Dean's surprise, Sam's eyes had started to shine with tears. He shook his head, laughing bitterly at the swell of emotions. "I just wish— you could have been
"Good." Dean patted him reassuringly on the back just once. "Now, let's say we make our feeding rounds for lunch, what do you say?"
"You forgot to create the lapels this time." Dean pointed out, frowning. It just reminded him more and more that all of this wasn't, well, for lack of a better word, real.
When Dean awoke, Cas was still slumbering soundly next to him. At first, Dean was a bit disoriented- when had that happened? Then he remembered cleaning out the cuts, helping him to lay down on his stomach, not wanting to abandon him in his condition.
"I want you to be strong, Jack." Castiel finally spoke up. "If you let your grace go dormant, if you choose to live like a human... no one will be able to heal Sam and Dean when they need it. Fly them away from danger. Or... help me to heal my wings. So I can fly again."
"Try and relax." Dean reached over and combed his fingers through Cas's hair, feeling the soft hairs sift between his fingers. "Think of happy things as you fall asleep. Maybe that'll help."
"Think you'll be okay here, Chuck?" Sam asked after they'd been waiting in the kitchen without a word from the man in minutes. He seemed like he would be okay- he was surrounded by his family, after all.
The babies weren't all that hard to take care of. For one, they never ate and that meant no dealing with diapers or baby food. They only cried when something was wrong, and usually cried when they needed to be brought back over to Chuck's house. It had been very easy when they were tiny and not crawling yet; but now they'd discovered that by moving their little arms and legs, they could actually
Chuck buried his face in a tissue and blew. A fallen angel standing nearby handed him another tissue and he took it and wiped his eyes. "Thank you, honey." He sniffled.
"Change? Change? Please?" Cas was muttering, shaking an empty bean can, a few quarters clinking along the tin sides.
hurt them. As far as I can see, you've been nothing but gentle and protective over them." Dean tried to reassure him by squeezing his shoulder a little. "When they hatch I'm sure you'll do the same thing."
"Thanks." Dean mumbled, dipping his head and staring at his hands laced together in his lap. He felt his face flushing in humiliation.
Chuck pursed his lips. "Ah...small amounts. I'm hoping that it will all come back to me, eventually." He looked past the brothers and smiled, coming up to the baby archangel who was napping sweetly on the floor, a tiny toy car limply held in one of his hands.
He didn't realize he'd been completely holding his breath until he stepped backward and took in his face in the mirror. Sure, the lashes were darker, longer, and despite how good the teen's in the video looked, he still had a bit of clumping in the middle lashes of his left eye.
Thank you for reading! I will be uploading this gradually, but it is a fully completed story so you won't be left hanging :)
"You are not porcine in anyway I can see, Dean." Cas spoke up quietly, finally slipping the plaid material over his hips, reaching for the folded shirt.
!" Chuck insisted. "I let my scribe hurt my babies...oh, nono, Jesus, I don't know what I'm supposed to
Bobby straightened up. "I'll say I've been retired for long enough. What kinda help you talkin'?" He asked gruffly.
"I...yes. I needed more supplies." She answered softly, looking at him curiously with watery blue eyes. It would have been hard to associate her with the rest of the rugged Stein family.
"The transition was...a little less than smooth, I'll give you that." Chuck laughed nervously, running a hand nervously through his unruly hair. "I'm still a little, ah, rough around the edges, but at least I have one conscious now." Chuck beamed at them, proud of himself.
"It's alright, Jack." Cas gave him a gentle smile, folding crow's feet around his kind eyes. "I promise. Focus on your true form, like I've taught you. Instinct will guide the rest."
There was a break before Sam bugged him again with another knock, his were always much softer than Dean's.
He hid his face in a blanket and the angel next to him wrapped his arms around him as his shoulders shook up and down.
"Cas. I think first off, you need more sleep." Dean felt bad that he hadn't seen the signs of total fatigue earlier. He had been kept pretty busy. "And now, you need to calm down. I don't know if you're having an anxiety attack or something, or you're fatigued or something but Cas, you have to pull yourself together. Deep breath, Cas.
The wayward angel had his arms spread over his head, an elated smile on his face as grace rocketed into him from every direction, filling him with the power of thousands of angels. The Scribe thought about how stupid Castiel had been for trying to use the Leviathans in the same way. Purgatory's creatures were filthy and their energy unpredictable. But heaven's angels...their energy was pure and clean, and as it filled Metatron to the brim, he felt his power expand to something he hadn't imagined.
Dean crumpled his face together, his breathing sticky-sounding as his saliva had already began to thicken. Cas's sure hands cupped his hip bones, pulling on him gently, impaling him on his cock with gentle thrusts. Dean whimpered softly, a stinging in his nose signaled the tears were coming soon.
about it, but um..." Chuck finally broke eye contact and once again nervously scrubbed the back of his head.
"Since he got that little camera of his, and I asked if he was making one." Dean finally cracked a smile, shaking his head a little. "I don't think he has any idea what it is." He nudged Sam on the shoulder. "Go on, go get some of that scrap booking stuff. I always thought you'd love all those little 3D stickers and doilies and crap."
Well, it was normal until Dean forced himself to tell Sam, Cas and Kevin about the potential danger Crowley had warned them about, and how he could sense demons were in the area.
Chuck blushed even more, his whole face turning very red. "Dean, please. This whole sharing-a-body thing is hard enough as it is."
Dean just fought back the tears. They weren't ripe enough, release now would hardly be satisfactory.
Sam was statuesque now, absent-mindedly turning a page as Jack continued to sketch on his own. The tears that were blurring his vision stung, and surprised Jack. He couldn't pin exactly why they were starting. He felt water trickle from a nostril, and he sniffed on instinct. Sam instantly broke out of his trance, and looked to Jack with a puzzled expression.
"Jack is only three in human years. How old do you think he is for a species that lives forever? Honestly, it makes perfect sense..."
Right when Dean's back was turned as he disappeared into the store, Cas pulled open the door and made a B-line for the liquor store right next to it.
Dean shot out, maybe a little rudely. He could feel a little bit of the angel's irritation percolate through the thin seperation, but it was only for a brief moment before Dean felt like he was by himself for the first time in weeks.
"I'm sure we will." He reached over and squeezed her shoulder reassuringly, and picked up a little off his egg with his fingers and began to eat. He'd had a pretty respected position in heaven, so it wasn't hard to fall into the role of leader here either.
Tobias helped Leo to his feet, and he hunched over a little and cried out. They were standing at the door of the old bunker. Tobias silently reached out and looped his arm over his baby brother's shoulders, helping him stand up as tall as he could. The blonde kid let out a sharp gasp and a hiss of pain. Maybe it
Leo laughed wetly, dabbing at his eye. "I'm not jealous of six. I can barely keep two in check, Bobby."
Red and Tobias pulled each other up to their feet, then roughly shoved each other to get working, their way of telling each other to be careful. Their wings knocked together as they pushed back into the chaos.
The world was churning for Dean at a very unpleasant rate, and he just tried to focus on his breathing.
The egg and the soapy water were obscuring anything from veiw, thank goodness. Cas was holding the egg in his lap, curled protectively over it. His shiny, wet chest was jumping with sobs as he breathed in choppy breaths and tears mixed with the bathwater as they ran down his face.
Sam, Dean and Kevin hadn't told Cas about Chuck yet. Sam and Dean agreed that they would both sit down with him and explain, after Chuck began to adjust a little better. No doubt Cas, who spent such a long time searching, would not give Chuck time to adjust like they were doing now and would probably riddle him with question after question. Chuck needed some calm right now.
"Guess what? I'm only eight pages away from the end of my journal!" Jack gloated, hugging the spiral bound close to his chest. "Well, eight and a half. I rounded like you said I could. Maybe I'll even finish it today!"
The Bunker was quiet during this time of night. Sam had taken Jack under his wing as his research assistant and apprentice, the two of them were hitting the books in the Library, much too far away from the bedrooms to worry about noise. After Michael's slaughter of all the others, it was especially quiet in here. A little more noise could do it some good.
"Wow, you're done already?" Dean asked in amusement as he saw Cas silently toting the thick photo album with him to the table. He'd been holed up in his room working on it ever since they picked up the developed photos.
Dean waited with Kevin in the living room. He saw Chuck wander through the house, just in the short distance be confronted by several concerned angels. Chuck moved through the house, finally sitting on the back porch swing. And he was looking out at his, it was true, massively over gardened backyard. He was still sitting there when they had to leave.
Dean looked over to see Cas standing in the middle of the room, his arms limply hanging to his side as his ill-fitting sleeves hung over his hands. He stared intensely at Dean, and Dean breathed a sigh of relief as the details began to fade away and his wings stiffened, drawing together and slipping away.
. Nothing had happened. Screwing up his face, he poked his fingers to Dean's shoulder again firmly and shot out more energy, and that was when he felt it. The repression.
The look in Cas's deep blue eyes almost killed Dean. He'd seen that look before, when Sam was little and would beg to keep the little kittens he'd found.
"We knew our own grace, or soul substance, very well. We knew how to manipulate it to possess people. We knew how to give out our energy to heal or fly. So now, with human-sized souls...it is harder to do, but we still know our own souls. Humans do not." Cas continued to explain. He was thinking about Bobby, Io, Red and Leo again. He figured he would probably always have them in the back of his mind.
"It's only glass, Io." Dean said, coming closer and stretching out his arms. "We're just going to buy new ones. Please come down, baby girl. We're not mad. I promise."
Dean crossed his arms. "This is what's going to happen." He growled. "Cas is going to carve a twin sigil on you, and one on me. And if you ever come within five miles of us, I'm going to feel it. And if you
Now, life for me is boring as hell. And yes, there are plenty of boring things in hell. Like the Endless Line, 5 o' clock LA Freeway Traffic, and Advanced Placement Chemistry were my personal favorites.
He steadied the egg with one hand as he pulled something out of his pocket with the other hand. He kept the round object resting in his lap as he shook three pain pills into his palm, pretty little white dots like pearls, and he swallowed them with some whiskey from the flask he'd also slipped into his pocket.
Dean still kept his eyes closed, and his chest did that warmish feeling again. "Hey, buddy." He smiled.
Cas shrugged tiredly. "He's a lot like Garth. He'll grow on you." He pulled the comb through the soft silvery wings one more time before reaching for the next tiny angel.
"Yeah, I'll set you up in one of the spare rooms." Dean yawned, and turned around. "It'll only take a minute."
Bobby smiled to himself as he read the newspaper. This was one of the best parts; he never had to scour the pages looking for a case. So instead, all he read was the comics. He'd maybe start to sneak a little of the crossword before his wife would bring breakfast over and smack him on the arm for starting without her. She always had been much, much smarter than him anyway.
Sam didn't expect it when Cas ducked his head into his chest, arms wrapping around his midsection and squeezing much tighter than he'd been expecting. Sam's arms hung there for a second in shock before he gently folded them around Cas's upper back. Castiel's back was jumping with hiccups. It took a second of disconnect Sam to realize he was sobbing.
"I'll let you go now, Dean. It sounds like you're busy." Chuck replied, and Dean finally pulled on the tiny underwear over the babie's hips triumphantly. "Yup. Bye, Chuck."
"You so much as look at them and I swear I will cut off your balls and wear them as a necklace." Dean said as I finally saw the whole dungeon light up for the first time in a long while.
Dean's frustration from trying to strengthen the dexterity of his left hand had grown so large that even the angel couldn't concentrate on anything else. Dean had been trying to write for hours now, getting increasingly more frustrated as time went on and his handwriting still looked like a kindergartner's.
"Forget it!" The girl spat, collected her clump of clothes in her arms and she stormed out of the cabin. The wooden door swung shut with a slight boom.
Chuck sipped on his large cup of Earl Grey, his fifth cup tonight. He was on a roll and he wasn't quite done with his unexpected writing streak of the day.
for Castiel growing stronger. Cas began to appear to share the bed with him almost every night, manipulating Dean's mind to make him feel like he was there, warm and comforting. Dean slept much better when he did that for him, knowing someone else was there with him.
Cas nodded, holding the egg close. "I've been...it sounds dumb, but..every day it's more, it's been building, just this sense of overwhelming paternity.."
Here, Bobby's eyes were a little brighter and younger, it was a time when his hair was darker and his body more agreeable, it didn't creak and groan and burble quite as much anymore. Karen came over, wearing her sunny yellow apron, and she put a record on the player, a peppy little song, and Bobby and her stood up and she wrapped her arms around his shoulders and they began to sway, and Bobby kissed her below the ear on her jawbone like she liked and she kept swaying, smiling, humming to the music.
, remember?" Cas sat down across from him, irritable as well. "I feel what you feel, Dean. Vice versa."
Dean closed his eyes as he felt his limbs getting heavier. Still, the two of them were long overdue for a talk like this.
"Oh shit, Cas..." Dean hesitated to reach up and peel away the corner of the gauze, he stopped when it earned a sharp intake of breath.
Dean wrenched open the door, scowling, as he found a flustered Crowley, his knuckles bloodied, looking up at him with disbelief and annoyance shining in his greenish eyes.
Dean cleared his throat. "Hey, I mean, you probably saved some people with your books, like they learned about ghosts and werewolves and things like that." He tried his best to make him feel a little bit better.
"Sorry, baby bro. I haven't seen any in this area, at least." He shrugged. "I've been trying to scrape by, taking money and getting food for myself. God, this being hungry thing sucks, doesn't it?"
Cas wasn't angry like the first time he'd berated Dean for treating him like a child. He realized Dean really was only trying to help him. He was very kind about all of it. Cas knew he would be kind with his fledglings, and that made him happy too.
“-My husband.” Cas whispered like the secret it still was, sending a wave of intense tingles down Dean’s spine and a whine to escape his lips. Normally, he’d lash right back at Cas about how they’d technically never confirmed that, hell, Sam didn’t even know about the marriage agreement they’d made off their faces one night. It was a drunken impulse, a verbal agreement and nothing more... well, until Cas brought it up again and again during their private moments like this.
He'd never realized until Cas possessed him that it felt a lot like he was alone in this huge, empty house. Cas softly breathed next to him and pulled himself up to rest his head on his chest. Dean smiled and snaked his arm around his back, liking that Cas was extremely warm but much lighter than a real human body would be, if it wasn't just the angel manipulating his mind to think someone was there.
"I swear to God I'll give you a buzzcut." Dean mumbled, as Sam's eyes flutttered closed at the touch of his cold hand.
Jack smiled at him, excited by the prospect of making something just as beautiful with his own hands someday. He thought of his future self: a Nephilim with jet black wings who was skilled enough to draw anything they came across, to add it to their every-expanding Hunter's journal. Carrying on what his grandpa started.
"Take care of them?" Dean finished, finally taking his arm away, much to Cas's silent dismay. "Duh, Cas. Of course. Y'know, maybe this time we can make sure they don't turn out to be such dicks." He flashed him a reassuring smile. Dean had such a kind heart under that rough exterior, Cas thought.
"Sam," He repeated, his voice rumbling, "Will you come with me to develop my disposable camera and purchase items for a book of scraps?" He looked so tired, he might have hopefully heard none of their conversation at all.
"First of all, never call me 'babe' ever again." Dean shot out. He could see exactly how Calcifer acted like Gabriel. "And second of all, why'd he faint then?"
Cas smiled. "I explained to you that your thoughts are very loud sometimes, haven't I?" Dean said nothing. This might be harder than he originally thought.
They continued to struggle up the hill of shifting sand, scrabbling fruitlessly against shifting sands with both their hands and feet, when suddenly their foot caught on something hard and a crunching noise made queasiness stir deep down in their stomach.
Sam handed him an unopened notebook, the plastic wrap shining back at him. There was cool art on the cover made out of smeary black lines.
"Humans do not have the same harness over their own souls like angels do. Well, former angels." Cas started to explain, he was talking with a soft voice so that he wouldn't run out of breath. He tried to take shallow breaths so his ribcage wouldn't move too much when Dean was working on it.
He had a hard grip on Cas's clothes, twisting the cotton as he let out another little strangled whimper and pushed closer to Cas's side.
Tobias crossed his arms and blushed a little. "It takes a village, yadda yadda. Look, we're getting off subject. We need your help."
"I know." Cas sighed and squeezed his eyes shut. Dean felt his anxiety and cold terror wash over him, and chills swept down his spine. That wasn't something the angel could fake.
"You know the rules," Dean had one hand curled around the shiny top of the open trunk. Jack looked at all the white plastic loops waiting for them in the boot.
"These hands are too small to be Cas's," Dean croaked, a small smile making its way onto his face. "But hey, I'll pretend anyway." He mustered a smile at Chuck and Chuck's hand softly curled around his fingers.
"You're a resident. Welcome to the Casa de Winchester." He laughed a little. "Nice water pressure, you got me to slave over your meals and whatever. But do your own laundry, okay? I'm not the maid."
Good thing one of the other bunkermen had probably grabbed the kid. "Shh. Don't worry about them, okay?"
Cas tipped his head to the side. "Your heartbeat is very fast, Dean. And I'm sensing anxiety. What's wrong?"
"What is one tiny little bee to you and me, Castiel? Would it matter to the hive if he disappeared? Would it matter in my life? Probably not. And their life spans are nothing anyway. What if I were to squish this bee right now, Castiel?" His thumb came ever closer to his pointer finger where the bee just sat, unaware. Cas's stony features began to soften only slightly.
"I have been doing a lot of thinking. About how the fledglings must consume energy. And if there is a demon in the house-" He held the redheaded baby just a little tighter and pressed his lips together in a tiny frown.
Cas shut his eyes and clasped Dean's hand, the other rested on his knee. Dean's head spun as a very familiar, powerful rumbling combined with a high-pitched whine began to build up, louder and louder. The last things he saw was an impossible cluster of thousands of shiny obsidian wings and feathers, some of them with gigantic silver eyes that slowly batted at him. And there were
"Cas-" Dean moaned, turning his cheek pressed to the seat to look at the angel with glassy eyes. "A little dignity,
Chuck shrugged the blanket closer over his shoulders. "Kevin, I really don't know." He shrugged. "Maybe it's because of their involvement with my kids. No other humans have that much angelic intervention."
"Whoa," He mumbled, rubbing his forehead at the unexpected throb. The last time his visions had been that clear were when Sam dragged himself and Adam into the pit. He wondered what in the hell would be that significant this time.
"Thanks," Cas whispered. "I'll try." The two weren't touching, but they were curved toward another and their faces were just inches apart. Dean stoked at Cas's cheek, not surprised to find wetness there and he stroked away the tear.
Tobias's pale blue eyes met Cas's dark blue. The archangel's young face looked troubled. "Promise me? You won't do this anymore?"
Dean gripped the phone tightly. "Cal. Listen. Feel under his nose for air flow. If he's breathing, that means he just passed out."
Dean looked surprised. "Wow. That was quick." He gently began bobbing up and down, cradeling the small back as the silver wings flapped sleepily. "That name mean anything?"
"Sorry," Dean mumbled, laughing a little and squeezing his hands back. He raised his eyes and looked into his face.
It was ironic that the person who's name he'd been screaming nonstop was completely out of his mind as he tore up the rainy roads.
Cas looked back at him, still clamping down hard on his teeth. Dean looked pitiful- he looked completely off-balance with only his left arm, and the bandages were packed heavy over his missing stump. It was strange- the missing space kept drawing the eye, like if the angel looked away and then looked back it would be there again. Dean's gaze was a bit glassy-eyed, and his skin looked pallid and wan.
"Thanks." Cas said quietly, glancing down at the glittering yellow strands of streetlamps, strung like pearl necklaces. He unconciously smoothed the soft eggshell again. He let his mind wander, just wanting to think things over so he would get it out of his system and never have to think about it again.
. He wondered how long Dean believed he'd be human for. Not like he could read his mind to find out anymore.
"I don't feel so good." Dean finally admitted. His head swam, and Cas felt it too. Dean heard a ringing in his ears, and Cas felt his conciousness slip deep down into blackness.
"It smells in here." Cas pointed out shyly. The room was completely standard, with grey concrete walls and no decorations to speak of. Even the bed with its grey covers looked like all the surrounding grey.  "Like dust and darkness. There's no warmth and life in this room." He shivered, and swallowed shyly. "Please don't make me sleep in here, Dean." He whispered, hugging his elbows like a little kid.
The first time this had happened, Dean had stopped the sex right away, leapt up and hid away in his bathroom for over two hours, feeling like garbage about himself. He'd made so much progress since then.
Dean asked in embarrassment. But, there was no sign of him. Suddenly this empty feeling felt a lot less like liberation and more like loneliness.
Cas grudgingly let Dean do whatever he wanted the next day, getting a handful of the blonde's ass and smirking at her. Dean could practically feel Cas rolling his eyes as he asked if she'd want to spend a little time with him after dinner that night.
"I'm sorry, Dean. They should heal soon." Castiel put a hand on his shoulder, his expression immeasurably guilty. "I don't want to risk harming you further by trying to heal them."
"Daddy?" Leoniel asked as Cas struggled to keep the squirming Red in check, who was splashing everywhere and making little whines of protest as Cas scrubbed his wings free of the caked-on mud.
"Crap," Sam sucked in a breath and rubbed at his eyes, pushing his thick brown hair back and away from his face, tucking it behind both ears. "I guess time got away from us."
Dean was freshly showered and in his comfiest pajama sweats and cotton tee when he padded barefoot into the Library. His brother and Jack both hunched over thick volumes at the long wooden table with green reading lamps. Jack's blonde head bobbed and snapped back up as he fought off his sleepiness. Sam was statuesque, barely even blinking as he robotically flipped a page.
Sam was about to call it off, seeing that the boy was clearly upset, but bit back his words as Bobby spoke up again.
Dean and Sam stood back to admire their handiwork. The white crib was perfectly assembled, and looked like it would be perfect for the quadruplets. Dean held up a hand for Sam to high five, but Sam snorted and went to get some blankets instead.
Cas only looked at his son's semi-scruffy red Converse high-tops. "I'm so sorry." Cas whispered. "I was not there for your birth. You or Samandriel, and I regret that very much.."
Dean shrugged, chuckling. "I might as well try. Can the name at least get a 'b' in it so I can keep the nickname?"
"Uh.." Dean wasn't sure what he should say now. He flicked his eyes to meet Sam's in the passenger's seat, and Sam looked like he had no idea what to do either.
Sam looked like he really didn't want to say what he was going to say next. "Cas is hurting, and scared, and right now he's pretty damn shaken up.." Sam started, and then he got that very Sammy expression on his face that seemed like he was looking at an injured puppy or something. "I think..it would be best..if we found..another fallen angel to take care of them." He tried out the words, carefully, like he was walking on thin ice.
"Dean, thank God you picked up!" Chuck's voice sounded relieved through the phone. " I've been trying to call you but my phone lines have been down for a while...and I haven't had time to go out to a payphone out of town because..well, I've sort of been housebound.."
"Wherever she wanted to go. If she's ever said she's wanted to live somewhere all her life, she's there." I said.
How in the hell Dean had even agreed to this he never knew. But next thing he knew, he was scrubbing shampoo deep into Cas's grungy dark hair as the ex-angel sobbed in the bathtub.
Io had her arms over her head, silently asking for Dean to pick her up from the tub. Dean quickly scooped her out and wrapped a towel around her shoulders, taking out a little comb and starting to work through the tangles in her dark hair, which was longer than any of the boys.
Dean laughed and flipped to the first page. There was that picture he'd snapped of him making pancakes, along with a caption underneath it. "This is Dean Winchester. Father must consume sustenance now that he is not an angel. Dean makes food for us to keep us healthy. You do not need to eat food."
Chuck woke up the next day, much later than he usually did. Only one woman was clinging to him this morning, and the room had much more floorspace than usual. Chuck smelled something cooking, and scrambled to get off his bed and rush out the door, quickly thumping down the stairs. "Wait!" He called out.
"Get out!" Dean demanded, and before he could stop his impulse his hand had curled around the shaft of his bedside lamp and he hurled it across the room. It impacted on the door, the lightbulb shattered, and the iron pieces skittered across the room. And before he could stop his words, they came pouring out of his mouth. "Why me, Cas? After the darkness hit, you thought you'd just come for me? Rescue
"Bobby!" Red burst out, squirming in Dean's arms and reaching for his brother. Dean chuckled and put Red down on the bed, who scrambled immediately to get to him.
Dean nodded. "I mean, the guy didn't even know he was friggin' God. It sucks that was just slammed on him like that."
"Will you..." He licked his lips and seemed like he didn't want to continue. "Will you watch over me?"
"Shhh." Dean forced him to shut up, pressing a hand hard to his shoulder and cradling the very confused baby in his other arm, Leo reached up and began to play with Dean's earlobe with his sticky palm.
? Dude, after seeing that mouth, I don't think I can ever get a BJ again!" Dean laughed again, holding his angel close.
Bobby met the kid's pale blue eyes one again. "Just gonna be frank here, boy. Why in the hell are you an
Dean set Io and Red down on the yellow blanket and scrambled to follow Cas. He knew it wasn't rational, but deep down he was scared that Cas might hurt them, if he was being careless he might put them in harm's way.
"Yeah. That'd be great. I'll come by and pick up the plate later." Dean called back as they went back into the main room from there.
Jack followed suit and shut his eyes, until the image of his true form slowly became clearer, and Jack could finally remember what it felt like again. His wings twitched, the large eyes dotted among them batted sleepily as they came out of dormancy. Silver rings that had been rotating at a snail's pace started to speed up, finally blurring like flicked coins.
"I can't Dean! I really can't!" He exclaimed, frustrated. "That first night, when I went to the roof? I wanted to..to.." He dug his palms into his eyes. "I wanted to smash it. I thought about hurting them."
"I'm not trying to scare them." Dean was defensive. "I'm just letting them know a little bit of the truth."
He finally found her, tucked up in one of the rafters, even though they told all the kids there was a strict "no flying in the house" policy.
"Can Cas come in here? When he wakes up?" Sam asked meekly, his eyelids slipping closed as he gripped the top of the covers. Sam had been sleeping a lot himself these days, healing was taking a lot out of him.
Each breath grated against the back of his throat like steel wool, and the taste of iron coated the back of his tongue.
"I didn't think so either." Cas pursed his lips. "I don't know why it didn't happen when I knocked you out or when you passed out after seeing my true form. It must be that when you fall asleep naturally, I do too. I've...never bonded with a human before. I don't know these things."
come across a little privileged, though,” he concedes. “Y’know. Not everyone can afford to pursue their dreams just because they
“The night before you left,” Dean answers, eyes made watery pearls in the cold light of his phone torch, “when—when Jimmy came, instead. Coming back here, after that… I guess it hurt a little too much,” he laughs, but it’s emptied out even as it escapes his throat. “So I didn’t. Coming back to the treehouse—it would be like remembering—
“Hey!” Castiel bellows, but Dean is already a good stretch ahead of him, and yelling his laughter up into the heavy clouds. “Hey!” Castiel calls again, feet slamming into the soil as he races to catch up with Dean. “You’re a cheat, you’re a fucking cheat!”
“He is,” Ellen nods. “I’m sorry about his outburst on your first day. He’s been all over the place, which again, isn’t his fault—but it can be quite upsetting. I think he’s yelled at me more times this month than over the rest of his life.”
“We’re allies now, Dean,” Crowley sneers. “It’s odd, to be sure, but that’s what we’ve just become, thanks to your surrender.”
Dean looks up from his toy cars. He’s set up a race track all round his bedroom because his mommy had nearly tripped over it when it had been in baby Sammy’s room and told him he had to tidy it up, or he’d be in big trouble. Dean hadn’t wanted to be in big trouble. So he’d picked up all his cars and moved them into his room, while his mommy fed Sam.
He has to find Dean. Before he goes, he has to find Dean, talk to him, make him see sense. He knows Dean’s heart, knows the patterns of spite and lashing out, knows that under the mark, Dean is more
Castiel has returned to Evadne. The Demon war continues, but Dean has been withdrawn, because the fear that the mark might surpass him, while he was within the grasp of Demons to adopt him, overcame Michael and his advisors. Especially at the news of what Dean committed during the Demon attack on their encampment. Dean can barely remember, can only remember a tide of bodies strewn about him like the rolling waves of the sea, and that Cas was the one to drag him away from mutilating them.
“Yeah, well… Like I said,” Dean mumbles, “it’s been hard to eat, since Jimmy… And anyway, today I’m worried, so…”
“He should be here,” Castiel finds himself saying, unable to stop himself from saying it. “He should be here—he said he’d be here—he always said he’d be here—”
“So, I’ve been meaning to tell you.” Castiel’s voice is odd, nervous. It never normally sounds like this, normally it’s all warmth and an endearing awkwardness stifled by a decade and a half of unquestioning friendship and familiarity. Dean frowns at the sound distractedly, peeling the label of his beer. “I got accepted onto that… Uh, you know the Fulbright Scholarship—”
These are the footsteps of his next few months. He returns to Kansas in late summer after a June and July in the UK bittersweet with falling blossom. Back in Lawrence, it’s the flavour of the year it was when he and Dean first met.
“Do you want to go back now?” Castiel asks gently. Dean’s eyes flick back up to meet with Castiel’s.
Mick huffs and beckons Dean to join him in crouching at the ground. Dean sighs, but squats next to him.
This isn’t surprising, when Castiel thinks about it. He spends most of his time reading in Human languages, and still more of it writing to Dean in Edian, the language of the Northern Kingdoms—and his visits to Hera are spent speaking almost exclusively in this tongue, in particular.
“Too kind,” Dean smirks. He’s about to lean in for a kiss in the cheap orange light of the apartment living room, but his phone buzzing in his front pocket makes him jump nearly out of his skin.
“Yes,” Castiel nods, and he looks up at Dean; there’s an odd comprehension that breaches both of their features, and then Castiel smiles gently, and Dean doesn’t even realise when he returns it.
Jack seems burnt out by all his chatter and goes to bed pretty early, accepting the hot chocolate Dean offers him, while Claire stays up to watch some 90s teen movie, twirling a drumstick in her hand as she does.
Castiel spends his time during the walk from the gates, up to the palace, healing. He begins with only one infant who cannot stop crying in their mother’s arms—but, as this draws attention to him, more and more people come out from their homes asking for their, their son’s, their wife’s, their cousin’s, their partner’s health. Michael walks ahead, his face downcast, hands trembling; Castiel worries that he has displaced the High King in what once felt like his home, perhaps his only home, by performing these services to Eofor’s people. Surely it must feel like a marginalisation.
Castiel’s thumb brushes slowly over the spot. It doesn’t quash his fascination. He wishes he could spend hours studying Dean’s skin.
Dean,” he sighs, and takes a step closer to take his bag out of Dean’s hands. “Keys?” He asks, and Dean tosses them to him. He unlocks and opens the trunk of the Impala and drops his bag in. “Thanks,” he tosses the keys back. “Honestly,” he laughs, closing the trunk, “Michael was worried that
“Oh, that sounds like a challenge. But I think I’ve figured out the perfect distraction for you in combat, now.”
“We can get out and stop, if you’re uncomfortable,” Castiel says softly. “Or if you feel like we’ve gone far enough, for today.”
“Listen,” Dean starts, frowning a little worriedly. “I get it if I’m not your favourite person, after the fight—I get that—but…”
weapons—save those of the ones who have promised to protect him. And now Dean has nothing with which he could hope to defend himself.
“You should open a detective agency, you know that?” Dean smirks. Charlie gives him the stink eye then continues.
But a father is a father, a husband is a husband, and Castiel can track the sorrow corrupting both the frames of Mary and Dean. But there’s something new and unfamiliar to this grief, something misty and intangible that wasn’t present even in the absence of Castiel’s mother. Even Sam’s grief is convoluted with something Castiel cannot place.
it was about keeping me alive, so you wouldn’t have to live without me, so you wouldn’t be lonely. The people who do that in the movies, Dean—
The next morning, Dean wakes Castiel up a little later than usual. His knocks are quiet and timid; Castiel worries that Dean regrets the turn things took the night previously.
“Some day,” Cas repeats with a smile. “I actually think it’s a really big commitment, you know? And our obsession with the nuclear family has meant that people who don’t really want kids, who don’t know what having kids actually
Castiel is hurt, too. Dean is reminded of the months of their first acquaintance, in which Dean spat out cruel and spiteful words, was cold and unyielding as granite under a veil of frost. He, like a petulant child; Castiel, constant and kind as the sessile oak.
“Can I help you?” He asks as he wipes down a table. Men at the other end of the bar stare and whisper, hunched over their table and drinks. Another few laugh in a way that makes Castiel feel uneasy.
I want to thank Nick for suggesting the Irish "you are my music" to be included in this fic. Love you! or should I say mo cheol thú :) x
“You alright, buddy?” Dean asks. Cas glances up at him, blinks for a few moments, and nods. The look couldn’t be more unconvincing. But Dean decides not to press.
“I don’t mind,” Castiel replies, shrugging. “We didn’t get to go riding together, the last time I was here. I think I’d like to do that again.”
He doesn’t look behind him. Behind him he can sense the pillars of sunlight that must be making Dean’s soul glint and glimmer, even now, even in the raw bleach light of a place no human was ever meant to tread. The blood and bone of nightmares. Castiel would give anything for Dean not to be here. And yet… to be here with him…
Her face was blotchy from crying, and she scowled at the ground, rather than looking at him, but he was not put off.
“And this isn’t an arranged marriage, or whatever you want to call it, honey,” Ellen comforts, her tone still soft. She rubs Dean’s shoulder and hands him the other robe. He takes it reluctantly. “You do still have a choice in this. But at least meet the Angel—for all you know, you might like him.”
But Dean is nervous, and it shows. He jokingly mentions how many people from their high school hate him, and worries about how many of them will be there. He worries about Lisa being there. He worries about Samandriel being there. He worries about Bela being there and freezing him over with a death stare. He worries about Tamara and Isaac being there and being awkward. Why he worries remains unspoken.
Dean wants to kiss him. Itches to kiss him. Wants to taste the golden ale they drank, this evening, on Cas’s lips.
“Oh, he speaks,” Dean says, and Castiel turns back to glare and his whittling. Dean softens. “I’m doing what you’re doing,” Dean says. “Carving.”
believed Dean to be absolutely perfect. And Dean may not have agreed, but he certainly thought himself to be half-decent. What happened between then and now to change Dean’s mind do drastically?
Dean looks down at himself, his arms dirtied up to his elbows, and the various stains at his clothing.
“And while the affairs of Kings may be saturated with self-interest, I can assure that this is not the case for Queens—at least not in my experience, and certainly not in this case. I act for the good of all Humanity—for our own safety, for our own benefit. Do you not see how much more prosperous—both economically and socially—a united front of Humans would be?”
“Perhaps you’re right,” Alastair acknowledges. “You seem so gifted with her, in the—as you say—short time you’ve known her. Only the space of a night. It’s remarkable you’ve such a skill with her handling. And her trust. Perhaps you should be the one to call her down, then.” Forcing
“So it is decided, then?” Michael asks, looking around the gathering. “Dean is to remain in Hera—Evadne will provide footmen to keep him out of harm’s way, until we find a safer place for him, that is not captivity—or until the Demon war is won?”
“No you hadn’t,” Dean grates his teeth together and makes his way down the corridor, to the living room, where he suspects Cas will be.
Dean crawled back into bed like a wounded animal and curled into his aching stomach. He once again felt too lonely alone in his own head. How was this going to play out? Would Dean's soul die before Cas's, leaving him the body? Or would Dean's soul expel the angel's when things got to be really bad?
"I can't lie to you and tell you it's painless," Castiel began in a low rumble. "Of course it is. I say this because you'll have your own scars to bear one day, Jack. You already have many."
His face was still pale white with an unhealthy yellow, wan look to it, and he had purple smears under his eyes and a flush of veiny violet on his sharp cheekbones and concave cheeks. Believe it or not, he looked a little bit better than "that day".
“Glad you think that, ‘cuz our firewood’s now good for dick.” Dean complained, getting snug again with a few shuffles and a sigh, lying on his side facing away from Jack.
"Dean, what if I mix them up? I don't want girl hair." Cas said, genuinely concerned, as he examined the bottle with a critical eye, trying to commit to memory that 'conditioner' was for Sam's use only.
Dean cracked a smile. "Cas, this is- I mean, this is your home now." He cleared his throat, he didn't want to sound cheesy. "I mean, Kevin's bunking down here with us too, and Crowley, but I guess he's the only one who's more of a prisoner than a guest. You, uh, get what I'm saying?"
"I know. I know what it can feel like. " Dean answered quietly. "Like you just want to escape everything."
Castiel's eyes twitched then folded open, white-blue grace shining within their pupils before fading.
Cas handed Dean one of the babies he already held in his hands, Bobby, and helped to gently clear away some of the shell for the baby, who fell out much earlier than they'd expected. The egg completely collapsed, containing nothing but air now.
"We would be able to sense each other's locations at all times." Cas began tentatively. "We could tell how the other is feeling."
"You doing alright?" Dean asked, reaching out and letting 'Bobby' wrap his entire hand around one of his fingers. "I hoped you'd feel better once you got to meet them."
Just the other day Cas had to get up on a ladder and yank a rattle from where it was wedged in the ceiling fan. Dean also would often wake up to find a baby had teleported themselves onto his bed and they'd be sleeping soundly and cuddled up to him, and he'd have to get up from his comfy bed in the early hours in the morning to go and put them back in their crib. Dean lost sleep just worrying about rolling over onto an unexpected visitor.
of those "symptoms" something like, I don't know, what those painkillers would do?" He nodded toward the multiple orange bottles. "If I'm taking
Dean just glared at me and mumbled something about them aging faster than humans and didn't say anything further.
. It's like I've chosen to make their voices louder than the others. My closest siblings are the ones I've bonded with, I create a tighter circle out of the masses." He sighed. "...Most of them are dead now."
Dean rolled his eyes. "I'm sorry. I wanted you to focus on healing, not worry about everything for once."
"He means, what happened?" Sam quickly covered for him, and checked the angel's pulse on his wrist. "The vessel is alive."
The angel's shoulders shook with a small sob. "I dun want 'em to see." He clutched at Sam's shirt and began to cry, little wet spots of moisture soaking through the fabric.
Dean patted his knee. "We'll find a way to fix that. We've got five people here- well, sorry, four, excluding Crowley-" (this earned him a very peeved glare from Cas) "-and we can make something work, alright?"
The two of them waddled up to the front door, heavy bags cutting into their arms all the way to the biceps.
The angel said softly into his head. Dean felt a warmth spread like thick honey in his chest, in his stomach and across his ribs like he'd just downed a shot of vodka. He slept very, very well that night.
"Here. Just wear this until we can take you to find some clothes your size." Dean handed Cas a folded up black Led Zepplin tee he owned, and a pair of red boxers. "Pajamas. Just don't leave the house in these, okay?"
It was a little hard to carry the egg and climb up to the roof of the bunker, but somehow he managed. And he went for close to four hours without another person's voice, and just those vile thoughts to keep him company.
Cas frowned a little, placing his hand on top of the egg almost defensively. "I want them to know what life was like here."
It was very warm here, Cas deduced. There was something very calming about the blanket of darkness, the steady breathing of Dean next to him and the way he'd sometimes mumble in his sleep, reaching out for him to reassure himself all of this wasn't some kind of dream. Cas always met his searching palm and would curl his fingers around it, smiling happily in the dark with his sleepless eyes fixated on his Hunter as he'd hear Dean's content, sleepy sigh.
kind of weapon if I can't even write my own fucking name?" Dean shoved Cas's hand away. "Leave me alone. Just let me do this by myself."
"Not Dean." Castiel said gruffly, leaning heavily on the railing of the steps. "He's unconcious. I brought us-um,
"I think it was both of ours." Dean replied, swallowing nervously. They both didn't want to bring up Sam's desperate cry at the end. "I'm worried about Claire too."
He poured the water over his head, the soap running down his bare shoulders, some suds snagging on the crusty scabs, and Cas sputtered as the water got into his mouth.
"Dean," Sam repeated. "We have to do something about this. We can't just expect him to be fine with taking care of two or
!- and held him so they were barely at a hug yet. He lightly kissed his cheek, which was pink and warm from the dilated blood vessels. "I will still have to learn all of this." He added as an afterthought.
Castiel was a bit startled when Dean reached for him, pulling him closer and burying his face in his chest, gripping onto the back of his shirt with his hand. The angel wrapped his arms around him, gently pressing him close. Cas pressed his cheek to his soft hair and rubbed his back in a slow circle, finally snaking his fingers up into the hairs above the nape of his neck. Dean's body trembled beneath him.
Cas was glad he didn't shower because even just pouring water gently over the healing skin over his ribs stung, and he liked that a bath was quiet and did not have loud, rushing water and that he got to sit down and and didn't have to be afraid of slipping. And he was glad that he made Dean laugh.
The fallen needed order and instruction and leaders in this time especially, when the world was chaos and heaven had one goddamn occupant who was batshit insane, when a life of living in garrisons and being powerful warriors turned into a life of feeling useless, dirty and poor, becoming ex-angels who dug for scraps. Life was so uncertain now.
, he just assumed it would have rinsed completely away in the shower. He'd have to keep that in mind for next time.
Cas was the only one who wasn't feeling the whole calm atmosphere as the phonograph swelled with crackly sounds. He was very worried about his youngest angel, the still very tiny towheaded baby with dark black wings.
"Cas," Dean looked over to the fallen angel, who met his gaze and nodded curtly. The little baby was passed on to Dean's outstretched arms. I noticed the long trail of brown feathers that lined down the fledgling's back, below his wings.
"I meant I'm not gonna die on you so you might as well start telling me things, Dean!" Sam complained. "I'm not...
In Jack's room, their bodies were in a sleep-like state as Jack's jaw and lips moving in subtle swallows as the glowing white mist flowed from the exact center of Cas's chest.
: hundreds of silver wheels all around him, some with more eyes on them, some with strange symbols or holes, and they had started to spin- faster and faster, becoming blurs like flicked coins. And Cas's dark hair was floating like he was underwater, the shiny red blood painted on his chest was glowing white, and-
expression on his face and took another long sip. Jack was waiting for him to speak up again. He wasn't reading his mind, exactly. He just knew Dean wanted to say something more. Something like that was an angelic perception that he could never really turn off completely. Dean either said "you give me the creeps" or "you're Cas's kid, alright" to it, usually one or the other. Depending on the mood the human happened to be in.
It was Dean who sewed up his forearm and the laceration above ribs with great care, he felt like he was fixing up some kind of broken doll. He took Kevin's blood and slid the needle into Cas's pale arm and then slid his fingers through his messy black hair, even though he wouldn't be able to feel it. He imagined Cas's blue eyes folding open right then, and he'd look to Dean with shock and maybe even a little admiration and then Dean would lean down and kiss him like he was the knight in shining armor who had saved the day...but, of course, his eyes didn't open on his relaxed face. Cas was out, he wasn't going to wake up for a while.
They simply watched the body language as Chuck curved his back, his elbows resting on the table, his palms gripping his hairs as Cas had a tight grip on his shoulder with one hand, remaining standing. Cas was saying something, his shoulders straight and angry. Chuck crumpled to the table, his head in his folded arms. His scrawny back shook with a sob. The brothers couldn't watch anymore.
Dean's gaze remained fixated on their fingers when he spoke up again. "Make love to me." His voice hushed, clamping down hard on the smaller fingers wedged between his own. "I need it- need you. Been dying for it."
"Thought of names for them yet?" Dean asked, clearing his throat and making an effort to try and speak just a little lower of a tone than usual.
" Jack nearly shouted, jolting his blankets off. He could feel his emotions rising, pinching at his throat. "Cas- don't
"Oh, Dean." He huffed in a cranky little grumble, the pressure from his hands surrounding Dean's face as he gently cupped his cheeks. "What happened this time?"
Dean was happy when the singing finally stopped. In the silence, his phone began trilling in his back pocket. He picked it up answered.
"Hmph." Dean ran a hand down his face and rustled in his blankets, sitting upright. "Mm. What." His mouth seemed to be failing to coordinate with his mouth at this hour.
Dean chuckled at that, with these dense volumes it was known to happen. "Alright, kid. Enough dead trees for now. Off to bed. Cas is already there to tuck you in."
Dean pulled the car over to the side of the road. His wrist on his left arm was heavily bandaged, the twin sigil to the large one Crowley had on his chest was burning now, alerting him that the demon was near. Dean was beyond relieved they'd have a warning system if the sort-of demon ever tried to pull anything.
Crowley tightly gripped his shirt with his handcuffed hands that still had some mobility to be able to feed himself, and Dean regretted that he'd made them so loose. Crowley forced him forward, his nose just inches from Dean's. "You think this is about
And maybe Chuck wouldn't be that bad of a God. But they had to find out how to get him his grace back, before Metatron really did steal the Earth away from him for good.
Dean stared back blankly at him. "Of course I'm worried about Sam," He replied, much too hollowly for the angel's liking.
The angels that Metatron had kept as his disciples clashed, and the air was filled with the rough, heavy noise of ceaseless shouting, and the angels who had been fallen and the ones loyal to Metatron clashed.
"I got a little something. It's for Eggy." He smiled and took out the box. "Ta da! Want to try it on?"
Dean didn't get to see the ordeal. It could have 'burned his eyes from his sockets' or whatever. Meanwhile, he went to get the kid's things in the oven and get them freshened up before bed. Still, even as he gave the shrieking, splashing kids baths and cooked their floury almost-cookie concoctions, he couldn't keep his mind from wandering about Cas. He carried a pit in his stomach. What was going to happen now?
"Yup," Dean replied and rolled over, pulled open his dresser drawer and fumbled around to find the rattling bottle of pills that he could hear rolling around in his drawer but he just couldn't quite see in the dim light yet. "Got 'em right here."
"Cas, there's, uh, been something we've been meaning to tell you." Dean said as the three of them walked back up those familiar steps to Chuck's porch.
"I...I don't want to imagine if..." He swallowed his words and instead lightly placed his palm on the small of Cas's back, being extra careful to not brush any of his gashes. Cas once again felt a warm glow on his cheeks and a slight fluttering in his tummy.
"What did you just say?" The woman looked shocked as she stopped scooping the oatmeal into the bowl mid-scoop.
Dean faced Cas and wore a tiny smile on his lips. "G'night." He said again. "Y'know, I'm probably never going to get tired of that." And with that, his eyes were closed, leaving Cas to count freckles. As the angel waited, he resorted to counting those slightly blonde-tipped eyelashes that would flutter slightly every now and then.
Chuck lifted an eyebrow at Cas. He opened his fingers, and the bee buzzed away as happily as if nothing had ever happened. "
Dean just couldn't seem to keep his hands off the fledgling's wings. He reached out and gently touched Red's, and the white feathers twitched and he nuzzled closer to Cas's chest. "What about their wings? Are we going to have to hide them their whole lives?"
It crossed Dean's mind to kill him. Crowley had killed plenty of the people he cared about. But he just couldn't find it in him to do that.
“Wow...” Jack drew in closer, admiring how every pencil stroke was made with confidence. Even with just a few lines, the flowing shape of Dean’s back was already coming into focus. “That’s amazing! Can I watch you draw?”
He dug around in the glove compartment for their trusty old and scratched steel lighter. He unsheathed the lighter with a faint clink, and swallowed heavily. "I'm sorry, Dean." His voice trembled, and he quickly flicked the grooved wheel with the pad of his thumb and the flame danced as his hand shook.
"What else?" Soloviel asked, finally sliding the somewhat dirty egg from the pan and cracking a new one. He was the leader of the FNF crew, which stood for Fallen, Not Fucked. The ragtag crew had around twenty people, were all up and bustling, some, like Sol, cooking breakfast, others getting ready to go out and greet the day, holding empty trash bags to do some dumpster-diving for 'new' clothes or supplies, recyclables, hell maybe even food if they found the right restaurant.
Sam sighed. "Yeah. I guess I thought it would be like that too. Poor Chuck. I bet a lot of people will be expecting the same thing from him."
Red yanked the door all the way open and grabbed him by the shoulder, pulling him roughly into a gigantic bear hug. "I knew you had it in ya, you stupid baby!" He cheered, roughing up his light blonde hair. Io slugged him hard on the shoulder and Tobais laughed and patted the spot she'd punched gently and apologetically.
"You wouldn't have to if you just put Nair in my shampoo again," Sam joked, but his voice was strained. Dean let out a huff of air, a sad excuse for a laugh, and dampened a different rag in a little bowl of water by his bedside, pushing aside those long brown hairs again and dabbing his forehead, clearing away the sweat that was beading on his cheeks and nose and chin.
feel that drive, Bobby." Tobias's pale blue eyes were twinkling as he looked down at him. Bobby didn't realize that his face had dropped into an expression of disbelief.
"Have I told you that you're my favorite daughter?" Dean laughed, and Io finally giggled through her tears. "I'm your only daughter, silly."
"Hi. You must be Calcifer. Nice to meet you." He smiled a little, wiped some blood off his palm on his pants and extended his hand. "I'm Chuck. Come on in. It's a little humble, but I hope you'll like it." He flashed a tiny smile.
The angel used both hands to cradle his neck before closing the gap between their faces and landing his first gentle press of his lips to Dean's. They parted with a quiet click, and Dean looked down, taking the angel's hand in his and squeezing.
"Mm." Cas hummed sleepily. Cas was even facing the other way too, it wasn't going to be weird. He just needed someone to watch over him for the night, right? And Dean could use some sleep too. It was just a friend caring for another friend, watching out for him.
He looked at the tiny, pale little face. He wondered what color his eyes were under those little lids. He tried to think of a name.
Kevin and Sam stumbled into the room, Kevin had a graphite smear on his forehead from all the writing he'd been doing- he must have fallen asleep at the desk again, and Sam was disoriented from his sleep.
"I know, I know." Dean's head bobbed from side to side as he agreed, he turned away from the mirror and met the angel's eyes once again.
Dean shoved his hands in his pockets and smiled. "You know, I don't mind God being a five-foot-eight scruffy little writer who lived at home with his cat. It's nicer than the big, booming-voice white-mile-long beard guy that I always imagined."
Chuck brought his fingers together, gently pinching the bee within his fingers. Its wings flapped and it gave one tiny buzz.
Dean sure as hell didn't want to see Crowley, locked away with those cursed handcuffs, and have him curse him out and beg to be released, screaming he'd changed. No thanks.
The angel looked flustered, and jumped to explain himself as he sat down next to him. "It's sometimes hard to hold back my natural instincts- please Dean, I don't mean to- breach on your privacy-"
Cas sat down, wincing, and Dean immediately felt bad how angrily he'd punched through his pocket and scolded him the other day. Dean dug through his first aid kit and pulled out his roll of gauze, the tube of neosporin, white athletic tape as well as a bottle of hydrogen peroxide and a few cotton balls.
Before Cas knew what was happening, he felt arms wrap around his upper back and his cheek was pressed to a soft flannel. "It's nice to see you, Dad."
Dean ran his hand down his face again and blinked to try and get a little more aware. "Future babies, minimal contact. Kay. I think they were planning on leaving soon anyway, once Leo's wings start feeling a little better." Dean explained, swinging his legs off the bed. He heard one of the babies wailing from the other room, he figured his nap was over anyway.
"So, he's still not talking?" Dean asked Sam, who shook his head. It was after dinner that same night, the newly human angel hadn't said one word to anybody at all.
His newly aware muscles screamed with every step. Damp leaves made strange, muffled and moist attempts at crunches underneath his shoes. The cold, humid air was stinging his skin and biting his nose and knuckles.
"I would never just..drop you, Cas. Frankly, I don't care if you're an angel or not." His eyebrows quirked upward and he prompted with a curt nod. "Understand?" His thumb briefly swiped at the back of his neck before he drew away again.
"C'mon, you're coming home with me." Dean smiled for once in days and extended a hand to help him up.
Tobias spread his wings and sped back to the heaven that Leo was hiding out in, a heaven with a quaint little French street. He came into the bedroom and threw open the heavy curtains, to the tiny balcony overlooking the street as sunlight poured in.
"It's just a nickname, Cas. You'll see." Kevin was the one who hopped up this time, leaving Dean and Cas alone.
“Really,” Dean confirms. “You all have my work email. But I’ll send you my personal one, as well. Okay?”
“Our youngest is best friends with the young Chambers girl,” Mr Penryn provides. “In fact, she’s out playing with her, now.”
“You know,” Dean struggles. He tries not to panic. He tries not to lash out. It’s like trying to tame the waves. “That… That sometimes loving someone, is… Is all fear that you aren’t enough. That you haven’t enough to offer. That what you are, or have, is too little.”
“Recite another poem for me,” Dean mumbles, his eyelids drooping softly closed. Cas exhales a gentle, short burst of air against Dean’s frame. It ruffles his hair and tickles tenderly at his skin. It’s amused and affectionate and had the sound come from anyone else, Dean would wrinkle his nose and scowl at it—but as it is, it comes from Cas. And Dean loves the thought that Cas regards him with affection more than he could ever admit.
When Dean imagined, all the years of his childhood made lonely with loss and longing, seeing Evadne for the first time, he did not imagine it like this. Some prisoner, some beast, taken to bars and bolts none have broken from, none ever will.
“I get it,” she nods. She goes up onto her tiptoes and kisses Dean on the lips—and Dean, Castiel nearly wretches, kisses Lisa like it’s the last time he’s going to get a chance to do so—to the extent that she hums happily against his mouth and his arms draw around her so tight it’s as though he wants her body to become a part of his, and vice versa.
“You’re a good big brother,” he states, so quiet and gentle that it nearly draws a sob out of Dean’s chest.
Ellen is silent, for a moment, expecting Dean to continue. When he doesn’t, she sighs and pats him gently, comfortingly, from where she stands beside his bed, thankfully choosing not to press him for the end of his sentence.
I really hope you all enjoy. I'm not gonna lie, I'm really excited to be working on this story again. I forgot the grip it had on me.
“Oh, shut up,” Anna’s voice has all the hardness of a bite, but she beams even as she speaks. She begins the washing up. “By the way, what are your plans for tomorrow?”
“Is he okay?” Meg asks, crouching down in front of Dean, who still clutches his head. “Fuck me, what an idiot.”
the neck, is only the immediate and no longer the sprawling metaphysical. No longer useful, could he still be worthy?
“After—after nine years of you not talking to any of us, you ignoring and avoiding all of us, you suddenly do—”
They stand in the library of the bunker. Sam cleared out sharply the moment Dean and Cas stalked in after each other, words turning from something weighted to pointed.
He thinks of the equations which mapped out reality, the building blocks slotted together to provide the stars with shine, the spheres their tuning, mist its rise above the earth, trees their thirst, and eyes with sight to appreciate these.
“You’re my best friend, Cas,” Dean says without thinking. Castiel beams and squeezes Dean’s shoulder before Dean has time to reprimand himself for spilling his thoughts so openly out to Castiel—and then Dean remembers. He and Cas used to share everything with each other. And now that the Angel is back, Dean thinks that they’re going back to that, again. The thought makes his insides tremble with something Dean can’t pinpoint.
Angels believe Humans foolish and immature, like young children, never seeming to grow up. Humans cannot control themselves, let alone their surroundings. Castiel imagines it to be maddening.
“And these past two weeks have been the best of my life,” Dean states. “And I wasn’t expecting that at all. I wasn’t expecting any of this.”
“I never thought I was either,” the soldier with skin the colour of dusk replied. It was said his mother had come from a land unknown, far beyond the mountains of Tyrzah, south-east of Eofor; in a country where the sun never set and winter never came. Mary had no way of knowing; the only one who had known Cai’s mother intimately for any amount of time in this kingdom was Cai’s father, who had turned quiet and reflective after his wife’s passing and spoke in few words. “But then, shouldn’t you be flattered, that you make me believe in magic and dryads and the like?”
And Castiel means it. More than Dean can know. Maybe, he thinks, terrified, more than Dean would ever
He rose, pulling a disgraced face, shaking his head solemnly. Gabriel could not contain his laughter.
A nickname that, strangely, has forged so much of Castiel’s identity; and all of it in relation to Dean.
“We’re fine,” Gabe shrugs, perhaps a little too quickly. Michael’s eyes have turned to the floor, Cas has turned away completely. Apparently, baring his soul to Dean as he used to, all those years ago, is now out of the question. “Or,” Gabe amends, “as fine as we
“A lot,” he confirms. His mom frowns at a grass-stain on his arm and tries to rub it off. “Did you know that there’s more than one kind of bumblebee?”
“I’m glad you… I’m glad you had somebody,” Mary looks at her drink. “I’m sorry it wasn’t me.” She takes a gulp of it. Dean’s insides tremble, half stubborn, half broken.
“I thought you said you knew everything?” Castiel says suddenly, looking up with an accusing frown. “So why do I need to say?”
"I don't deserve you." Cas sobbed. "I don't deserve any of you after everything I've done. I was not there for my own son's birth."
, Dean." There was a short silence that overtook the small cabin. Cas was working very, very hard to obscure his emotions and make sure that Dean would never guess that he was jealous.
Cas nodded, he was still wrapped up in his towel. "I believe..it's indecent for you to see my vessel without garments." His voice was low and rumbly as he finally said something more than a few words.
Chuck had to pause, breathing hard, right when his finger hit the little 'd' on the keyboard. The line blinked back at him, willing him to write on. Chuck tried hard to steady his breathing, he hadn't even realized he'd been writing. His little orange cat headbutted his shaking wrist and dragged his body underneath with a little purr, and Chuck finally came to his senses and petted the soft ginger fur.
“It’s finished.” Cas’s voice yanked Jack from the floatiness of pre-sleep, and Jack squinted and yawned. It was a beautiful sketch, capturing the likeness of Dean so well even without showing his face. Jack traced his fingertips over the flowing lines in awe.
“Castiel Winchester.” Dean’s lips nudged the ridge of his ear, the angel’s breath caught beautifully in his throat as he emptied into Dean as the human held the back of his head close, tucked into his shoulder.
"Awesome. Thanks, dude. I owe you one." Dean rubbed his hands together and licked his lips. "Finally I get some ass. Damn, what's a guy gotta
"We don't need the spare bedroom for the fledglings. I'd rather share a room with them anyway, to keep them safe. Please." His begging eyes bored into Dean. "Dean, he's my brother."
"Just a small bowl of oatmeal, please." Dean asked, his voice still hoarse from the cough that was slowly going away. "Extra sugar."
"Cas, I'm sorry. Please just come back, man." Dean sighed, running his hand down his face. "I was a jerk, okay? I'm sorry."
"You want to know what Cas does with his wings?" Jack tipped his head as he asked, and brought a finger up to his lips in thought. "Geez, I guess it would be weird if they were invisible all the time." His eyes lit up as he smiled brightly. "Sure! I'll tell you."
The girl with the brown pixie cut and fingerless gloves sipped on a half-empty, flat coca cola drink someone had thrown out two hours ago. Everyone was wearing grimy backpacks, pots and pans hanging from them and clanging together, the teenagers had shotguns crossing their backs, others lugged lumpy white plastic bags full of cans and beer bottles that slid around and clinked with aluminum-to-glass. One munched on half a stale bagel. Someone had to walk with their arm around another's shoulder, pausing every few minutes to spew behind a building after getting food poisoning from some rancid chicken yesterday. That was just another risk, and they weren't afraid to take them.
Sam was saved from having to respond as Dean came back into the room with Io and Red. Io was wearing her favorite pair of yellow cloth overalls, and Red was wearing that ridiculous "I wuv hugs" shirt that Dean bought in disbelief when he saw that the stores were
"Cas?! What the hell are you doing in there?" Dean banged on the door, unsuccessfully twisting the doorknob and banging again. Cas's fingers delicously split as he dug out a shard of the mirror, leaving clear little red fingerprints like red-lipstick kisses on the silver.
"Cas?" Dean felt his breath catch in his throat as he sprinted and crouched to his knees. "Dude! I found you!" He smiled and a pent-up breath he didn't know he was holding. He surged forward and hugged him tightly, then pulled apart and wrinkled his nose.
She finally fluttered down on her silvery wings and buried her face into Dean's shoulder, hiccuping and crying a little more. "I'm a bad daughter." She sniffled.
"Not human food. Energy. And they've only been sleeping because they must create some of their own energy when I can't supply it."
Instead, he put the newspaper on Sam's bedside table, he left the flask in case he got thirsty, and quietly peeked into Cas's room. He was still in a deep sleep, hugging that little egg tight. Dean quietly pulled up a chair, wincing as it scraped along the floor.
for you." Dean huffed. "Fuck off," He laughed bitterly, turning away so he didn't have to look at him.
Dean took the flask of cold water from his pocket and held it up to Sam's pale, cracked lips. "Drink," He commanded, tipping it back slightly as Sam swallowed slowly. Dean knew it hurt his throat to drink water but he didn't care, he'd been making him do it every hour or so. He needed to be hydrated if he was going to start healing.
Dean they're so hungry and its my fault he's so tiny and what am I going to do if he starves to death Dean I don't want my babies to die and I'm killing them I'm hurting them just like my other family and they're starving and I-"
"I'm okay. Thank you." Chuck reached for his glass of water and took another sip. A silence fell on the four men.
"I can't use my powers to heal you, in case I harm Chuck's body. And if I come back into yours, I won't be able to use my powers at all. But as long as I don't use my powers, you will heal naturally." Cas replied.
He frantically had checked for his pulse. It was faint, but beating steadily under his fingertips. He wanted to shake him, and berate him for being so goddamn stupid.
you, Bobby. You love this heaven. You love that you get to rest. But somewhere deep, deep down underneath the sweetness and the comics and the breakfasts and the dancing...you
"So I'm really only your second vessel, huh?" Dean chuckled, raising his eyes to meet Castiel's. The angel was wearing a solemn expression, his eyes piercing into Dean's. He pressed his lips together and nodded just slightly.
-" At this Dean came even closer, gritting his teeth and wearing that scary, I-mean-business expression. "-so much as touch a
"I've been injured." Cas began quietly, hanging his head as if it were something to be ashamed of. "I can't fly anymore. My own healing is slow, and I can barely heal others with my grace. I'm hardly of any use to Sam and Dea-"
Dean groaned in annoyance and covered his face with his hand. "Cas, Jesus Christ, stop with the dramatics, you're blowing this whole thing out of proportion!" Dean looked up at him, beginning to laugh at how serious Cas looked.
I offered to give them some tips, I mean, I'd had a son back when I was human. I was shut down right when the words left my mouth.
Dean barely had time to register before Cas had wrenched open the door and was sprinting out into the street. "Cas!" Dean barked out, scrambling to close the ajar door as cars honked and swerved out of the way.
"I don't know either." Cas spoke up after Dean had trailed off. "Me not having a tangible vessel...that makes things a little more...
"Yeah, let's go out to the food court. And I swear to God if someone tries to talk to me abou my face again, that's not the only face they'll be concerned with..."
"Better keep up, bro!" A lanky, red-headed young man shouted behind him with a devilish grin, bright locks falling into his face. He twirled his blade and winked at the tall, mousy-haired man behind him with the six stacked brown wings.
?" She yelped, climbing off of Dean and cradeling her stinging face. Dean struggled to keep the massive things in check as they flapped drunkenly, he winced as they bumped the bedpost, feeling like hitting a funny bone but even worse.
The three of them finally stood up. "Well, it looks like you're being taken pretty good care of here." Sam said, and Chuck nodded.
"He won't know how to act at parties!" Dean called down the hallway so he'd have the last word, and Sam couldn't help but let out a snort in a half-annoyed, half-amused sort of way at his older brother.
Cas gasped and his eyes flew open, his body moving to sheild the egg, scuffling back on the bed and pressing himself against the wall.
." Dean hissed, trying to flex his muscles to try and stop the burning, but something felt off. "Untwist it or something..
!" Cas shrieked, and Dean burst out of the bathroom. Cas looked pale in the face- and Dean heard the faint tapping coming from the egg, too.
The world outside would not be doing much better, he reasoned. This Darkness seemed to make humans lose everything that gave them humanity- their kindness and love for one another would be completely obliterated as the substance would be allowed to fester inside of them. The angel bowed his head and sucked in a deep breath. He couldn't do this by himself. He needed Dean by his side, and after he cured him they could begin to try and fix this mess, together.
"You're so good to me, Dean." He sighed, his eyes still closed, a minuscule yet happy smile on his lips. "Am I lucky to have you." He eyes slit open just a little as he said that, he squinted up into Dean's face. His cheeks were tinted with small splotches of pink. It was kind of endearing.
"C'mon, he even looks like him!" Dean insisted, pointing out the tuft of light brown hair, as if that justified it.
The angel obliged, his soul pouring back in and filling the body once again, his arms softly wound around Dean's chest. Dean made sure to not show him his blistering face, he kept that side of his face firmly pressed to his pillow. Cas kissed the back of his neck ever-so-gently and Dean felt burning tears spring to his eyes.
"Hey! No running in the house!" Kevin was calling after them as Red, Io and Leo were tearing through the house, just having come in from outside. Sam groaned when he saw that mud was splattering everywhere and brown footprints were all over the house.
Cas was still looking out the window, he grunted in response. His eyes scanned over the buildings- a laundromat, a donut shop, a second hand clothing store...
, right?" Dean felt dumb right after he said it. Of course the kind, somewhat timid little five-foot-eight writer wasn't
"I don't understand that reference." He mumbled, he felt like his sleepiness had something to do with being agitated. Was there a word for that? "Dean, I'm tired."
"Yeah." Dean replied huskily, squeezing the angel a little tighter. "I don't want all this to all go away. I know cherubs and clouds and sunbeams or whatever might be nicer than this ol' crappy bunker but...I'm finally happy. I have a family now. My little brothers, whether they be blood like Sammy or brought in like Kevin, and the babies, and..and you." He hesitated, his cheeks burning hot.
"Look, Sammy was the same way at your age. Kid grew like a friggin' bamboo shoot." Dean chuckled, looking like a duck on water as he handled the steering wheel with ease, like it was all subconscious by now. "No need to hide it, alright?"
Bobby whimpered out and tears streaked down his face. "Why is this happening to me?" He whined, his tiny shoulders shaking. "Daddy, it hurts!"
Dean jumped as he realized the bathwater was tinged with red, not just the grimy brown. "Cas?" He didn't expect a response.
"Well, two are out so far. We think there are more inside, but we don't want to interfere." Kevin explained, scrubbing the hairs on the back of his head.
"-Besides," Dean grunted when he'd finally drank his fill and he wiped his mouth off with the back of his hand. "I don't think I can 'murder the world' with only one arm."
hate me, you had every right to hate me, considering everything. I guess the weight of that… I didn’t know what to do. I’m not good at this kind of thing,” Dean looks down. “Never have been. That’s on me.” He swallows. “Has—has Cas told you, what happened? What—what exactly happened?”
“He was—he was a family friend, a close friend of my father’s, before he moved to Cornwall with his wife.”
He envied Gabriel for being able to observe the city through the new and bright eyes of an infant, for being able to bounce through the streets and greet every person he met with as much sincere captivation as he liked. As for Michael, he had to stand on ceremony—not least because his mother would have him flayed if he stepped so much as a toe out of line, no matter how much softer father would be with him.
The world aches, it is dissolving into blackness above Dean; he glances down and sees a broken sword still caught in his leg. It has torn through him with such ease that Dean is reminded bizarrely of a piece of cooked meat speared onto a fork. Vision fogged, he tries to move his hand, but not even a fingertip twitches. Dean is going to die, and this certainty grows stronger and stronger inside of him.
Another few days pass, and Michael doesn’t attempt to speak to Castiel again. He has a new trainer now; he eats his meals alone, he avoids passing Michael’s room or any of the halls and chambers where he knows Michael will be holding court or discussing matters with his advisors.
“This is hardly the time for selfishness, Dean,” Michael nearly shouts over the Human’s bitter, curled words. “Be glad we didn’t think it wise to lock you deep in the heart of the Great Mountain of Eofor—”
“Yeah,” Dean nods, drawing in a shaky breath. His fingers graze the higher strings of his guitar and they hum out something soft and quiet and trembling into the still air, pressing at its stagnant melancholy with the promise of melody. He shifts the instrument off his lap and puts it on the floor, leaning it up against the arm of the couch. “I feel,” he tries, but can’t finish the thought, can’t even articulate it. “I feel,” he tries again, tears springing to his eyes, but he can’t breathe out, the air stammers in his lungs.
Angels are cowards, he decided long ago. They are all too happy with surrounding themselves in their own self-righteousness; with being worshipped and idolised and adored by humanity below them, who all the while are slaughtered by each other as much as by the Demons from the deserts across the Great Sea.
“Dean—” He squirms, body twisting and coiling, but to no avail—Dean has had the advantage of surprise, and is bleeding it dry. “Dean, get off!” Castiel shouts over Dean’s laughter, trying to grab hold of Dean’s hands to still them, but Dean is persistent. “We’re—look, we’re about to fall off the
Castiel gives permission for one of his books to be made into a film. He wants Dean to compose the score, and he’s lucky he’s got the right connections, because Dean’s in hot demand. People in the film world are starting to see him as some kind of miracle worker, wonder boy, after his launch into success at the Academy Awards. Dean just rolls his eyes at it—all he’s ever really wanted to do, he says, is make music for people who
Anyone intruding would have risked knocking it down—anyone intruding would have found it difficult to
Castiel pushes his door open and clambers over his bed, reaching to the bedside table on the other side of it, from the massive pile of books, notebooks, paper and pens he keeps there. He picks up a notebook at the top of the pile, with brown lined pages and a plain cover.
“Do it,” Dean says. “Go. This is good, it’s a good thing. It hurts for me because—well, you’re my best friend. Of course it’s gonna hurt. But I’m so happy for you, too. So ignore me if I get emotional. I’m proud of you.”
“If I were flirting, you’d know,” he replies. Dean is desperate to counter with something, to see those hungry dark eyes spark again, but Tom has turned away to take someone’s order. Dean sighs and turns in his chair. He spots Lisa glancing at him from across the room and turns back around again, face red. He really should apologise to her. But it’ll probably mean less coming out of the mouth of a drunk man than it would, unprompted, and sober.
Sam rolls his eyes and asks about the mess Dean’s made to shut him up. It works, and Dean sets about clearing the china shards and coffee up, which gives Sam a chance to talk properly to Eileen, and then say goodbye at the door. Sam goes all quiet and bright when she kisses him goodbye.
“No,” Sam shakes his head. “Hera was built for defence… This place?” He gestures around them. “Definitely not.”
“I want to hear you say it,” Dean grins. “Is that so unreasonable?” Cas gives him a look in answer, one which makes bright and rounded laughter bubble from Dean’s lips. They stop beneath a bower of ivy. Green light dapples them. Cas rolls his eyes, and Dean laughs nervously. “See, me? I think the word might be love.”
As little sense as they make to Dean, he drinks them up. He likes the husky quality to Cas’s voice—only further amplified when he is sleepy and sated—and more than this; he likes the warmth and affection that drips off each word spoken by the Seraph.
“Goodbye, Dean,” Cas smiles, softly, taking Dean’s hands and squeezing. They’d had their ‘last’ kiss in the car, so Dean wouldn’t have to do it in the airport terminal, but now Dean can’t help it.
The next day, they drive to Ellen’s to pick Claire up. She’s sat at the kitchen table over a plate of French toast, glowering at them as they come in.
Bela smiles and carefully wipes her tears so as not to smudge her make up. She really hasn’t changed.
When Dean is back, the bird is placed on the perch, and Bobby smiles at her. She’s still, but cocks her head minutely at every reverberation of sound or movement, every breath from any of them. Some constant state of heightened sense. Dean shakes his head.
“We went to a bookstore,” Eileen beams, “and picked something out for each other. We’re gonna read our picks this week and tell each other what we think. And after the store, we went to a coffee shop nearby and started reading.”
Dean nods, throat tight, remembering the pizza he made with Claire after the storm of her getting suspended, overhearing Dean in his exhausted vulnerability and rejection, her smashing up Dean’s most expensive guitar and breaking down in fear of abandonment.
“No, Gabriel,” Castiel answers firmly. “But the point is—it’s not—it’s not unreasonable to suppose that knowing the name of a certain porn star could—could indicate anything? About someone’s sexuality?”
a reason? But then, at least it’d give it structure. Now everything seems mired in chance and chaos.” He glances up at Victor, who watches him, brow knotted sombrely. “It could’ve been us, you know? A tragic fire, and losing the people we loved. It could’ve been us.”
And so the night returns to Dean’s cycle of staring, staring like a promise, across the crackling flames at Castiel. When he returns to Castiel’s side, the heat from his body sings off of him and his hands find Cas’s forearms.
“I’m calling Cas, like you told me to!” Dean grumbles in reply. Cas’s voice sounds troubled and put out down the receiver.
Dean’s body is left mostly uncovered—the only item of clothing he wears is his undergarments, but aside for that, he’s bare. Dark, scarring gashes cover his skin; Castiel can make out at least one stab wound at the top of his leg, peeking out from under his covers, and what he thinks is another on his chest. During Ellen’s chiding of Dean, Castiel guesses that she redressed the wounds, which are now covered with an odd translucent mixture of pale green plants and oils that look strange against the colour of his cuts. Truthfully, it is a miracle that Dean survived. Castiel says as much. Dean only snorts in response.
“Gone,” Dean shrugs. He looks away from Ellen’s concerned eyes as she pulls a questioning face at him, prompting more. “I don’t know where.”
“Want a drink?” Dean asks. Cas assents with a smile, and Dean makes one for Ellen to soothe her temper, before reordering the kitchen table as she would have had it before the interruption which the goshawk must have presented to it. By the time they sit down at the table, she’s placated enough to join them.
Castiel stares into the flames. The fire heats the tears in his eyes. Why can’t God take this pain from him? This longing for a future which is now past?
Cas is right, on this front. The acoustics alone in this place are sublime, plus the choir—well. It’s easy to think of heaven with candles lit in a long cathedral-like hall with huge engraved ceilings and towering stained glass, while a choir sings in a unity and harmony that seems to make even the candles tremble at the idea of such a purity.
He swallowed thickly and curled over the sink, just staring at the silver drain for a moment and feeling the familiar prickle of arriving tears. Even after all these years, his dad's influence still haunted him. He didn't want to cry, not yet. Not under these circumstances. He needed a certain set of arms around him to let himself do that, the burning-good sensation of being stretched so full, those heavenly, gentle strokes of his. Quiet reassurances whispered into his ear.
"It can be hard work sometimes, Dean, I'm sorry." Cas explained, and kept his hands cradling Dean's cheeks and before moved them to his shoulders.
Cas gently passed his hand over Bobby's light brown hair. They were sitting in Cas's room with the door shut, trying to create a calm atmosphere for Bobby when he was growing out his second set of wings.
"Hey," Dean broke the silence with a clearing of his throat like Jack knew he eventually would. "If you notice any more of that kind of thing, you can tell me."
"Make sure you keep this on for tonight." Castiel's tone was soft and sweet, but Dean loved the way it came out as an order. "You look lovely."
"Good morning, Chuck." Cas said happily, when they'd gone up to the man's door to drop by and get the fledglings fed well today on their way to the store. It had been almost a week since they last saw him, when he'd been a weepy mess.
The baby slobbered on his fist, and then wiped it off on the perfectly clean pajamas, leaving a smear of shininess like a snail trail. He toothlessly giggled at the face Cas made. That was another thing; Bobby had already started teething, and there was no sign of it from the smallest fledgling yet.
Cas tried to think. A name with a 'b' in it, strong enough for an archangel? "Tobias." He finally decided.
Dean furrowed his brow when he heard strange noises like hollow bangs and a muffled yelling coming from the wall the prison room was behind.
"You are not my brother." Leo snarled, punching his face again so hard his cheek flopped to the concrete and a spittle of blood colored the ground. "And I sure as hell haven't forgotten what you had done to my father."
"Yeah. That." Dean coughed, and suddenly realized he still was holding the angel quite tightly in his arms. "I just want you to stay, Cas. I know things could be different now you're an angel again but..."
Dean shoved him off and stood a length away, pulling his gun out and aiming between his eyes. "Grab me like that again and I swear I'll blow your damn brains out," he growled.
. The thought crossed his mind. I mean, there was no way all that could go down without at least some mental scarring. Dean was even feeling a little shaken up himself.
Calcifer frowned. "Yeah. Sorry, baby bro. It's just part of being an archangel." He shrugged. "And the rest are seraphs? This li'l guy wasn't so hungry anyway. Let me see the baby girl."
Bobby's cheeks shone with a sheen of sweat, and he nodded. "Kay," He said quietly. His breath started coming faster in his throat, and his fists clenched hard against the fabric. Cas watched as the rest of the lower tier of wings pushed from his body, collapsing onto his tiny pale back, wet and dark with the moisture, looking like they had when they were born and not sleek like his topmost layer.
Who the hell was he kidding with this?! The makeup clashed with the crows-feet wrinkles near his green eyes, the weathered spots on his skin dotted amongst his freckles. He was an older man, not some teen girl. He felt stupid, and the beauty product seemed to have the opposite effect as he felt even uglier than before. How was that possible? He felt like a fucking faggot, he thought. His teenage self that never got this kind of experimentation resurfaced in a split second.
Dean punched his hand into his pocket and took out the bottle of pills. He raised his eyebrows and tipped the bottle just slightly to the side, as if he were saying 'oh, really?'. "And it's going to stay that way." He growled again. "You come to me if they start hurting. And I'll administer them."
The smell of burnt flesh made Castiel retch and cough, but at least the blood flow had been cut off. The angel took Dean's good arm and looped it over his neck, and with a loud grunt slung the rest of his body across his back into a secure Fireman's carry. He wrapped his forearm tightly along the back of Dean's knees and lifted, a hiss of air escaping his interlocked teeth. Dean's listless head flopped down and his ash-dusted cheek pressed to the angel's shoulder. The stump of his arm hung just a few inches from the angel's face as the other limply down Castiel's back, his curled fingertips brushing the small of his back. That charred smell made the angel wrinkle his nose in disgust.
Castiel rested his forehead in the crook of his arm, pressed to the cold steel of the door as he leaned against it defeatedly.
Jack padded down the hallway, and stopped in front of Cas and Dean's door. He took in an anxious breath, and he knew Cas would be able to sense him standing outside.
"It can sense you're in need of its sustenance, being an infant. You won't take too much from me, Jack, please. Consume my grace and get your strength back." Cas drew away but still held onto Jack's shoulder.
"You've been hungry," Sam kept the lethal smirk on his lips, standing up and towering over her. "Ravenous, even."
Dean groaned in annoyance and humiliation as he covered his eyes with the palm of his hand and just lay there, finally the wings settled down with a slight bristling sound and drooped like putty over the bedframe and draped to the floor.
"Terrible twos and teenage years all rolled into one." Sam chuckled, slipped in a bookmark, and finally shut his book with a faint snap. "Who would have thought
And that big, empty house felt just a little cozier. So yeah, he didn't really mind having a roommate.
"It's just another skill, anyone can build it. We'll start with the foundations." Sam came back and sat in the chair next to him. "Start by drawing a circle."
"What?" Dean asked, not breaking his concentration as he snipped at the next stitch and pulled it out. It hurt, but in a itchy relieving kind of way.
to do with it," Dean mumbled, his eyes falling closed once again. "Something came out of the frickin'
"Angels can open their souls to give out energy, because of their harness on their own souls. Demons can also open their souls in ways humans can't. Fledglings were always protected in heaven, and if any of them feed from a demon-" He hugged Red even closer.
"Just over a half of a fluid cup." Castiel replied. "The substance, within a body, takes on a liquid form."
The Winchesters and Kevin only stayed for a few more minutes, watching as Chuck seemed to have calmed down, working in the kitchen to make the large pot of chili for all the ex-angel residents.
"Jack. Sam and I are finishing the set up for your lesson today." Castiel turned to him with his kind, upturned eyes with crow's feet in the corners that Jack felt made them look even friendlier. "We'll get you when it's time to begin."
"We'll go by friggin' Babies R Us or something." Dean said gruffly. "I don't know any of these other little places or whatever."
"Okay. I'll make one for me, too, Kevin, and hell, I guess I better make one for Crowley." He locked his jaw and his hands curled into fists. He hated that he needed to take care of the man that was the reason Sam was so sick.
"So, what? Cas has been... br- breastfeeding him or something like that?" Jack didn't have to see Dean's face to imagine the flush on it. "Fine! It's weird! I find it weird! You win! Is that what you wanted to hear?"
"Agreed." Cas's own cheeks felt a little hot. Being a bad kisser had never been a concern of his before. Now, like a middle schooler, getting better seemed to slip to the top of his list. Maybe he could ask Sam. Yes, he could do that. Sam wouldn't mind, would he?
It had started on a whim, and now it had reached a point where it was ceremonial, where the angel had released to the words almost every time since Dean had first whispered them into his ear.
He could see the molecules in this girl's hair, and suddenly it was all individual strands of keratin instead of a mass of fluff. He heard her blink as her eyelids slid wetly over her eyeballs. He saw the makeup caked on her cheeks and could count each individual powder particle settled on top of her greasy blackhead pores.
“So much raw emotion. So beautiful.” Castiel commented softly as he pulled away with a soft click of suction. He continued to speak in staccato sentences, each accompanied by a rhythmic thrust. “You always worked so hard to hide this part of yourself. I never understood why. It’s what made me fall for you. What made me want to become human.”
"Soloviel?" A young angel, a teenage girl who had her dark brown hair cut short just so that it wouldn't get in the way, jogged up to a man who was using a cracked pan over a fire, scraping the egg with the top half of a broken spatula.
Cas took over and moved his limbs, which were much too heavy. He wasn't used to being the one in complete control of Dean's body, he hadn't taken complete control of a body since Jimmy. Cas managed to drag the body to the medical cabin, throwing up a blood-and-bile mixture onto the ground in front of him around halfway there, getting a little bit of it down the front of his jacket. Oh no, he knew this was Dean's favorite jacket.
"Yeah, sorry about that. If you're really hating it I'll pour you a cup of OJ." Dean finally was done peeling away the bandages from the one side, the ex-angel's back was like a lipless mouth, Dean only just now noticed how jagged the cuts appeared to be.
Cas slid out, and Dean flipped over to lay on his back slowly, lowering himself by the elbows, eyes downcast.
He nodded, and Dean dipped the cup in the warm water and poured it over his skin. "Okay. Let's get you out and we have to clean those cuts, Cas."
Tobias ran a hand through his brown hair. "On the way over...my little brother, he was the one who's always been the best at time travel, did it all the time when we were kids. The rest of us couldn't pick it up after we were about ninety years in. So he picked up the slack...he worked too hard. They broke in a few places."
"When Castiel hugs you," Jack began, then smiled brightly. "You can't see it, but, well, he uses his wings, too."
"Dean- what do you think abour going to retrieve my vessel?" Cas asked. "I-I want to kiss you too. Not just reach into your mind and manipulate your nerves and pull from your memories and use that to shape the touch. I want to kiss you, actually kiss you. And maybe-"
Sam, like the huge teddy bear he was, reached out and rubbed his scrawny shoulder. "Hey, it's okay. We're gonna help you any way we can, alright?"
"I can tell it's in there now. Right before I turned, when I was a demon, I was always holding it off...and it's building back up again. I thought it was all gone, but...you were right." Dean admitted, training his eyes on the floor. "Cas- I can't live like this anymore. I can't fight it this time."
"Thanks." Kevin shot out, taking the half of the sandwich with one hand as he still scribbled with the other, his eyes not leaving the papers. He took a large bite, his eyes still scanning the reciept paper, he seemed like he was making sense of the jumbled numbers and codes.
were screaming and falling in flames and for all he knew they were dying. He didn't know, and right now, he couldn't find it in him to care.
"I told you, he's my week brother!" Cas mirrored him and crossed his arms, stepping back and shifting his weight from foot to foot.
"Cas-" He croaked in a panic, and he felt someone gently push back his hair. He closed his eyes at the touch, his head lolling back into the pillow once again with a small moan.
"It's okay." Tobias took the arm and rolled it around gently so his wrist was facing upward. One of the very thin vertical scars from the scissors was peeking out from the gauze. "I don't want you to do this anymore, Dad." He took his thumb and tenderly smoothed it over the almost-healed line, and it disappeared to only leave a pale wrist.
Tobias narrowed those eyes, and the sharp expression he gave Bobby finally had the human get a glimpse of his potential to be powerful. "You can still do a hell of a lot, Bobby. And it won't be by yourself. That's why my brothers and sister aren't here right now. They're going around and asking other people here for their help."
He came forward, and even in his proximity the little angels began to stir and awaken from their naps. "And Cassie said there was an archangel?"
It was sweet when they came together and helped pour things into the large kettle. They always touched Chuck on the shoulder or back as they added an ingredient, he'd softly mutter a thank you and stir the pot, as angel milled about and brought him salt or peppers or other seasonings. It smelled amazing.
"Like a glove," Sam smirked, drumming Dean's fingers along the cold steel table. "I knew it would come in handy. Keeping you alive." He said coldly, examining the near-perfect stitching again. Suddenly, his stomach growled loudly and he placed his new hand over it. "Say," He began again. "You haven't happened to go outside since the dust came?"
What the hell was he supposed to do with an ex-demon prisoner? Or an ex-angel who was falling apart at the seams?
"What is it?" The angel whispered back, nudging his nose just underneath Dean's jaw and planting a soft, apologetic kiss on the fever-heated skin there, overjoyed that the hardened man had actually
Dean groaned and ran a hand down his face. It had been close to twenty minutes and they hadn't even gotten halfway through the list. "Babies...can't control their bodies like grown ups can. They wear that so food waste doesn't go everywhere, alright?"
Like this moment, for instance. Dean had been trying to check out this girl's ass for some time now and finally as she was walking by, he reached out for a friendly squeeze of it when Cas took control of his hand and jerked it away.
"Class dismissed," Sam said. He looked so happy when he said it, Jack didn't ever want to stop asking for the permission.
"I should probably sleep as well, shouldn't I?" Cas ran a hand down his face. "It's been a long day."
Nowadays, Dean really couldn't give two craps, it just became second nature. Honestly, he didn't even think about it anymore. Him and Cas were comfortable in one body. And ever since the night they'd slipped into bed together and cuddled, Dean couldn't deny that he was feeling a pull toward the angel. And even though Castiel still kept a thin separation between the two minds, Dean could tell there was
"I...don't know." Cas scrunched his face up in confusion. "I think...I fell asleep. I hit my head when I fell off the stepladder."
Dean took the bowl and gave her a small smile. "Thanks," He nodded at her. He had no idea everyone paid that close attention to him. It was kind of nice, knowing that everyone had been so concerned about the two of them.
"I guess you can start by telling me everything you know about Metatron." Chuck said, shuffling a few papers around the desk and digging around for a pen. "If I really am God and he's my kid, he
Dean slipped his fingers into Cas's as they walked down the hallway. Cas felt a warmth spread quickly in his chest again. This was nice. You can't be bad at hand-holding, right? Dean gave him a reassuring squeeze before he let go, stepping into the kid's room. Cas knew things were never going to go back to the way they were before. For one, maybe he'd get to share the bed more often with Dean instead of only on occasion. That thought spread warmth like alcohol in his stomach again.
"Yeah, you said that, but I don't know what the hell that means!" Dean barked back. "I'm not letting a stranger into our house."
Cas was frowning as he looked down at the pinkish-red stripe that stretched vertically down his forearm. It had barely healed, the black stitches emerging from his skin creeped him out a little. Anything black emerging from his skin since the Leviathan incident creeped him out. Good thing Dean was taking them out.
He felt sick inside. He wished he hadn't consumed all the pain pills the other night, only to throw them up again. He needed to feel numb. He craved it.
"You love humans, it is very plain to me. It all started when you pulled a human who become very special to you from hell. Don't think of this as a flaw, Castiel, because it's exactly what I admire most about you." Chuck's voice flowed on softly. "Bees are much like humans. Humans are shut off in their own little hourglasses of life and can be gone to you and me in the blink of an eye, dedicating their lives to things that seem so trivial to us. But it would not be right for me to squish and kill that little bee."
Chuck swayed a little on his feet and steadied himself by planting one hand on the tiled wall as he rubbed the temples with his other hand.
"Kidding." Dean quickly interjected before the angel could get any more offended. He blinked and his eyes searched the angel's face slowly, he was frowning sourly and hovering very close to his bedside. Dean realized Cas must have hated to see him hurt like this, and being powerless to help. His worrisome expression was easy enough to figure out.
Cas looked thoroughly embarrassed. "Yes, that was what I just said, didn't I? Chuck is the only other person here made to be a vessel to an angel."
"I guess you didn't need those pain pills after all, huh?" Dean's arm shot out to restrain him as he was trying to stand up. "No, Cas. Hey- we don't want them to tear more. Just sleep here tonight. I'll head out to the couch or something."
Dean sucked in a breath and his eyes fell closed, he fell forward and his chain clinked as it stopped him from falling completely forward as he pressed his palm to the cold concrete floor. "...Cas," He croaked weakly. The angel couldn't help but reach out and steady him with his clean hand on his shoulder. "It's alright, Dean. This is almost over."
Dean's eyes widened and he exchanged glances with Sam. His grace, whatever Metatron stole- he had gotten it back.
"Chuck?" Dean rubbed his eye. He felt bandages all over his face, on his forehead and his temples and even one on his cheek just below his eye.
Tobias rang the doorbell and tapped his toe along the concrete as he waited for someone to answer the door.
I wondered how many angels I'd consumed. What they'd be like now. If it made me a bad person killing them like that, before they were born. At the time, the power it had given me made me elated. But thinking now, I was filled with guilt instead.
"Hmmm." Dean grunted, his consciousness coming up closer to the surface, yet he still wasn't fully awake, Cas could tell with his re-found abilities.
"Here, Cas." Dean was the only one who came into the room this time. He was carrying the egg, which had a collapsed top but a very faint tapping could still be heard. "I...everyone else is eating dinner, but Kev brought you some soup if you want. I can take those little buggers so you can get some sleep."
The archangel pressed his lips into a line and flicked his pale blue eyes away from Bobby's face. He tightened his hands around each other until the knuckles were white.
Tobias's eyes grew sad. He clasped his hands together on the table. "Do you.." He licked his lips. "Bobby, do you have any idea what happened?"
They could only hope that he was back in heaven, throwing Metatron into some kind of time-out corner.
"Dean, listen! I'm still part demon, I can sense they're coming." He rasped out, and rolled his eyes at Dean's blank face. "Demons, dumbass! They're coming for the egg, Dean!"
"You're going to fly again, Leo, I promise." Tobias answered, but he was still uncertain. It showed as his brown eyebrows drew together.
you. And it will be slow. Just because I'm out of hell doesn't mean I've forgotten what I learned down there. You get it?"
Bobby ran his hand through his brown hair. "Who's 'us'? Five angels and one of 'ems this Metatron guy... you sayin' there's
"Fine. I'll bring around your dinner in a few hours." Dean grunted, trying to sound as unsympatheic as possible as he picked up a few plates leftover from other meals. "I'll leave this open a crack, to hear you only if the demons get closer, and that information only, got it? And don't even think about banging your hands again." Dean scowled, trying to sound threatening.
He finally saw Cas as he sat in the living room, jotting a few notes down in his dad's journal. He immediately stood up and made his way toward him, cold sadness and paranoia spiking through his chest like a dark icicle.
Dean was speechless, and he let out a few strangled sounds that were barely words. Frusterated at himself for his inability to say anything, he rushed forward and planted a soft kiss on Cas's lips, taking the sides his face in his palms.
Leo shrugged again, pursing his lips. "It's okay." He mumbled, looking up at Tobias with wide blue eyes, they were somewhat glassy. "Think they'll heal soon?"
"I'm not evil anymore!" I insisted. "It's unnerving, but I don't feel the need to attack or hurt anyone anymore!" I shivered. I don't like being good. There's too much pain and guilt involved. No damn thanks.
less enjoyable for Dean. The girl smirked hungrily at him before crouching on top of him and pulling down his zipper.
"Here you go, Kev." Dean said, setting the plate down with a clink. "Real brain food this time. Not that mystery meat you'd been eating before."
"Go dress the others." Cas said moodily, taking a washcloth and gently scrubbing the mud from Leo's arms. Dean turned around without another word and went to go find Io and Red, wherever they'd gone.
Jack finally let himself open his mouth, he'd been clenching down so tightly to try and stop himself.
Sam's footsteps faded down the hall, it was only then he realized his tears had stopped flowing. He decided to take Sam's advice and set a countdown for twenty minutes on his phone.
Dean spun around, feeling like the black goop clinging to his eyelash hairs was a neon beacon on his face, anger and humiliation colliding like crosshatching waves, but the look the angel gave him calmed his waters.
Cas rubbed his hand over Red's hair, the bright hair fluffing up in tiny wisps. His white wings shuffled a little and his hand grabbed Cas's collar, reaching up for his earlobe.
The ex-angel turned back around to face him with a series of small splashes. He was frowning, holding on to the egg tightly, which was shining with water.
Dean was shamelessly looking at the little girl and making little baby noises, and perked up as he heard Cas speak. He reddened a little, as if he forget Cas was awake. "Sorry, I didn't catch that."
Jack nodded, his throat still felt like it would be unreliable to use at the moment. The two men waited for him to set back into motion, to swipe at his cheek and take his pencil back into his grip.
"Daddy?" Leoniel asked again, a little frown on his freckled face. He felt forgotten a lot, the little sweet boy swallowed from the chaos.
"Jesus, he's small." Dean said in astonishment. This fledgling must have been two-thirds the size of Red, who was smallish already. He had tiny, pitch black wings and a head of wispy white-blonde hair. "Shit. I don't know if he needs help or something."
At least I didn't have to yell my voice to shreds to warn the Winchesters about the demons in the area. They'd been far away the day I beat my damn hands to a bloody pulp and wore my voice raw. I warned Dean a few more times whenever they moved closer. But it seemed like now, they had vanished. Maybe a few hunters had picked them up, I don't know and I don't
Dean's bones ached from how exhausted he was, and he knew he'd sleep rockily if he was out on the cramped couch all night. The bunker was a big place, and it could get freezing at night. He looked back toward his bed- Cas looked peaceful, sleeping there on his stomach. The blankets had managed to slip down and just a bit of his bandages were showing over the top of the quilt. It wouldn't be right for Dean to leave Cas in this condition, right? What if he needed something?
Dean was able to meet up with Cas on his way to the dining room, and he roughly grabbed his bicep in passing. He was met with somewhat of a startled blue-eyed look, then Cas pressed his lips together and avoided his eyes.
Dean sighed and tried to relax. "Okay," He replied into the darkness, hooking his good arm around one of his pillows and settling his cheek into it. "G'night."
Dean chuckled and brought the mug to his lips once again, Jack knew it was to hide a smile behind its rim. This dad of his could be funny like that.
"Because I've known you for six years now and..." Dean trailed off, not quite sure what to say. "Look, you told me yourself you'd stick around long enough to "see me murder the world", remember that? After everyone else was gone? If you were willing to stick around for me in the first place, well, I guess...I'd stick around for you, too." It was almost like what he'd just said took a second to sink in for Dean, as he suddenly dipped his head in embarrassment. Had he really just said that out loud?
“Hush, Jack. Don’t worry.” Castiel drew him in close, reassuring him with a tight hug. “He doesn’t know yet, that this is an effect of carrying my grace within him. We will tell him soon, together. As a family.”
Cas's warm breath was brushing on Dean's shoulder. Dean's eyes had adjusted to the darkness, and he could just barely see his face.
"No." Cas replied. "I was about to say "never in a million years" but I believed it to be even more improbable than that."
"...sam." He heard Castiel say in an extremely tiny voice. Dean's eyes widened- he'd finally spoken up. He was stunned for a second before he replied.
The painkilers slowly began to numb the stinging from his shoulderblades, and had him feeling just a little bit calmer. His stomach growled, with a pinched, rumbly, unpleasant kind of hollow feeling. He tucked the bottle of pills and flask back into his pocket and climbed slowly, carefully down the roof for dinner.
?" Io was asking in her tiny high-pitched voice, Dean found her and her brother by the foot of Sam's bed, flapping their wet wings to try and hop up on the bed where Sam held Bobby. Red's pale little butt was just out there for everyone to see, he'd abandoned his towel at the foot of the bed.
Dean's ears felt hot and his face flushed pink. "He didn't know how, okay! He was filthy! And I didn't see anything, FYI!"
Jack found himself half-awake, flinching as he felt patters falling onto his sleeping bag, cold droplets of water dripping onto his face. The patters tapped on the flapping tent’s drenched yellow skin, the loud hushing noises were three-dimensional, wrapping around him in the tent like a blanket of white noise. He heard Dean swear under his breath and the gray dawn glow dimmed as he threw the rain tarp over the netting on top.
His hands were starting to get clammy curled around the cardboard packaging of a tube of mascara while he waited in line at the drugstore.
." She announced, sitting down with a sigh and looking into the pan at the sizzling egg. "I can't believe we just saw him like that!" She yawned and tugged some of Soloviel's greyish quilt to fit over her own shoulder. "Damn. It's chilly today. Can you make me one?"
Chuck slowly woke up to find two pairs of arms around him, a man and a woman were fast asleep on either side of him. He gently slid their arms away from his body and scooted to the edge of the bed, careful not to wake the four other people who had somehow managed to squeeze themselves onto his queen-sized bed.
"We'll start packing today." Soloviel announced, patting her on the back, standing up and stretching, slipping his last cigarette out of his pocket, lighting it, and taking a drag.
Cas leaned over and folded him into a tight hug. Since neither had been raised human, it lingered for as long as both of them wanted. Jack let out a quiet gasp when he could sense it, the way Castiel's grace stirred, welling up closer to the surface for Jack to consume. Feeling it there within reach, his own grace plucked with a pang of hunger and he winced.
The angels got a lot of shell in the eggs he had leftover from yesterday, and they had to throw all of the soupy yellow with sharp white shards out. Chuck went to get his wallet and keys and go down to the store once more for more supplies. And he bought in bulk at Costco and was still running out much too quickly.
Tonight was a peaceful night in the bunker. Everyone had just finished dinner, and it had been Sam's idea to dig through some of the old Men of Letters records and play them to see which ones were good enough to keep and play again, and which ones would be good to sell.
“Good,” Cas encouraged him, sweetly cradling one side of his face in the curve of his palm as he lay flat beneath him. “Release, my love.”
But that still didn't stop him from getting a kind of warm, fuzzy feeling in his chest when he said the word. He made another mental note:
Tobias ran his fingers through his smooth, mousy brown hair, his cheeks reddening a little. "It's a long story, Bobby. And that's not why I came here, anyway. Have you been talking with Ash and Ellen lately?"
Cas hesistated for a second before answering, wetting his lips with a sweep of his tongue. "Potentially."
"Ah-! Oh, uh...let's um...not go there." Dean sputtered, trying to play it off as a chuckle, and the girl closed her mouth, sat up as she straddled his legs and cocked her head to the side. "What?" She asked, offended, narrowing her eyes. Dean just could tell that her voice had that slightly rough edge to it because she had had pretty severe colic as an infant.
Castiel felt like each minute he spent with Dean was another minute he was a burden to his friend. He finally slipped away when Dean went to care for Sam again, spoon-feeding him some soup broth laced with vitamins and helping to drag him to the bathroom.
"That's not a hiccup, Cas! The kid friggin' time traveled!" Dean insisted, holding the squirming right-time Leo in his lap, hoping to not have the two interact too much.
Cas froze, his fingers biting into the sharp corners. He wanted to finish the job. Black circles pounded behind his eyes as he felt a tinny buzzing in his ears. Human red, red, red was spilling quickly and thickly. Cas felt like his mind was halfway there. He felt his face tighten and drain of blood in a cold rush, his mind made things sharp but fuzzy that the same time. His ears buzzed and rang.
He hiccuped wetly and couldn't bring himself to look Dean in the eye as he tipped his head down obidiently, letting Dean wash his hair for him like he was two years old.
"Sorry we had to park so far away, Cas." Sam said, having to cut his stride almost in half as Cas shuffled along slowly.
They entered the cavernous room, taking the staircase down to the main level. Castiel was waiting at the bottom, hands folded over the knob at the end of the handrail.
"Oh, I get it! I can keep my lines straight without the guides now. Thanks!" Jack piped. The paper was also much thicker and creamier than he was used to, kind of like those important old scrolls they used sometimes. Those didn't have those blue line guides either.
." Dean felt a grip of panic seize him as his prediction had come true. He gingerly pressed the pad of his finger to the sore, and it smarted badly. "No, no, this can't be happening-" He met his panicked green eyes in the reflection. If he expelled Cas, the angel could die. Castiel was still too weak from when his own vessel had been destroyed, he was still gradually reclaiming his abilities. And if he was expelled from Dean's body, he could be brought somewhere very dangerous where the enemy angels in heaven would tear him to shreds. Dean wasn't about to let that happen.
"I'm...I don't know, Dean." He brought his knees up, the egg pressing to his legs and his chest, and his hugged around his knees. "Will you..will you and Sam and Kevin maybe.."
Cas scowled and Calcifer threw his head back and began laughing. Cas crossed his arms and Calcifer clapped him on the back.
He'd got the first vision as he was taking a shower, singing the song "Free Falling" on the top of his lungs. And just as he was reaching for the bar of soap, this vision hit him particularly hard. His vision switched from a (somewhat) hairy, wet arm reaching for the bar of soap to a dark, stormy sky with purpled clouds, and he heard a yelling from a nearby church in the middle of nowhere.
"Uh..that yours?" Dean asked awkwardly, clearing his throat. "You do a little fooling around without a condom?"
"Why not? I think we've pretty much scoured this little area of the town. Rico's pizza keeps yelling at us when we dive in their dumpsters. Says it scares away the customers." Soloviel laughed, wrapping his jacket tighter around his shoulders.
," He cried out, his nose smushed up against the memory foam mattress, his open lips leaving a shiny smear, his mascara rubbing left streaks of ashy black on the sheets. He hid away his face as he hiccuped out a sob, stifled by the thick padding.
"I mean, dammit Cas, how well do you know this guy?" Dean asked, crossing his arms and lifting an eyebrow.
"The angels...Bobby, all the angels are gone. One of the angels, his name is Metatron, he was the one who did it. He cast them all out and stole all their power." He huffed out a frustrated sigh. "There's not an angel except him left in Heaven. And the only ones left are on earth...
Dean blinked and turned to the next page. He'd taken a semi-blurry picture of Sam in bed, sleeping, when he'd still been having trouble getting out of bed a few days ago. "This is Samuel Winchester. He is not feeling very well after he tried to shut all demons into hell and almost killed himself. But he will get better because he is a strong man. Father has helped Sam before with his mental scars from Hell but I could not help this time."
"Dad-" Jack choked hoarsely, his hand shot out to grip his shoulder and he shook it roughly again. The angel was just as limp.
"You'll get the hang of it." Dean tried to reassure him. "You'll get the hang of a lot of this- being human stuff."
"You lost a lot of blood." Kevin explained, as Cas's eyes darted to the bag and the to his bandages. "Jimmy's got a rare type, O+. Good thing that's what I have too. You probably won't need more. That's just in case."
"Ehem. Um. You can use lotion." Sam said, and then indicated to underneath his own eye. "Jess used to do that when she stayed over at my place. It gets rid of makeup in a pinch, if you... don't... have remover handy." Sam slowed down toward the end of his sentence, realizing he should probably be treading this territory lightly.
"It's late. You should rest." The angel stood up once again, as if he were expecting Dean to follow his lead. "Your emotions are...strong, Dean. This is hard for me, too."
He was a magnificent sight to be seen, gigantic from all the centuries he'd spent alive and growing. He had four faces, one for every direction, the one looking at Jack now was heart-shaped like a human's, yet featureless with the exception of a a gigantic pair of cobalt eyes. His other three faces were animals, but they must have been so ancient that Jack couldn't recognize what they were. One looked faintly feline, the other had an elongated snout like the very beginning of an elephant's trunk, similar to a tapir's. Many of the clusters of raven-feathered wings were tucked in close like an anxious dog's tail: slashed, burnt, maimed, and one of his main wings was the charred nub that Jack had spent most of the day trying to capture on paper.
"Good. Do it again." Dean demanded, doing a tiny little hop to adjust the baby who was slipping down his side. He took his hand off Cas's shoulder and used it to hold the baby in place. Cas breathed in deep and a shaky breath came out once again.
Jack perked up when he heard Sam's footsteps, and the tallest of his fathers was suddenly there in an archway.
