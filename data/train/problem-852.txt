There was a soft whine from the baby monitor on the desk. John and Sherlock’s head turned quickly to it, noticing that they had raised their voices in the excitement of the case.
, he added.
"Hello..." he said looking at the camera with a smile, "are you ready for the story? This is the story of Sir Boast-A-Lot..."
They were back in 221B nearly for twenty minutes now. John sat at the kitchen table, tea in his favourite mug, Mrs. Hudson across the table. She was looking straight at him with a very enquiring expression, waiting for John to finish the answer to her question. A simple question it was, for such a thick answer:
It was too soon when John received a call about Mrs. Hudson being shot. Sherlock felt how all of John's rage somehow surfaced at that very moment, calling him a '
“Do you think we have to wait long?”
“She’s coming from the front door.”
. Cup them in your palms, feel them... are you doing it?"
A growl of laughter escaped his mouth; a laugh that started from his belly and had him doubling over in a matter of seconds. Sherlock had been halfway about to check on him before he noted John was actually laughing so hard it seemed he was having a stroke.
“How many people did she…”
"Good enough! I trust you, Phil, you are a great ally."
In silence, they heard – and
"Greg, are you up for a cuppa?" the voice that greeted him was a worried voice, raspy, dull. John could almost read in it that the DI was just waking up.
After an eventful dinner, as soon as the door closed upstairs, Sherlock pulled himself up from the table and sighed deeply and slowly, all of his lungs emptying. He looked down and noticed the completely neglected erection that was still tenting his jeans.
"Most of it. It wasn't me, though."
"What!"
"John."
What do you think Sherlock noticed? Let me know your theories!
After a beat, Rosie made a noise in her throat – very similar to Sherlock’s frustrated groan – and lifted both her hands to her face in a dramatic gesture. Something was distressing her and she’d clearly learned from the best.
"No, John. You need to sleep, I need to think."
Louis - the man whose daughter was saved by Sherlock - was near the place and had noticed the detective over the rooftop. He waited for the detective to come down from the roof and, after some talking and data comparison, they reached to the conclusion that is was probably a simple accident. Sherlock was quiet after that; he didn't say a thing and asked Louis especially not to mention anything to Dr. Watson. Just in case.
“But that's momentary, you know? You were going to get bored in the end, so you should thank me..." there was pause before the voice talked again, "everything changes now, Sherlock... you allow John to become your heart and I told you clearly: I'm going to burn the heart out of you and I'm going to enjoy when I see that face of yours contort with fear and hurt for the first time... you were terrified also when you were drugged but now it's going to be different, you know?"
Over the speakers, there was the noise of a chair being dragged against the floor and then the woman’s voice again. “Before you go, Hamish, it is pertinent to let you know about the other aspect of this spa.” Noise, probably John sitting down again, “but before I tell you, you need to have an open mind about this business. You have complete judgment in deciding if you want to take this or not.” There was a pause and then John talking in the recording, “Okay, go on.”
"You're right..." Armand whispered, "When I turned thirty last year and changed my section they gave me a new card... I got surprised how only a couple of numbers changed."
"I came to ask you to uh... retrieve... from this investigation." Lestrade scratched the back of his head waiting nervously for the answer. Sherlock glared at him humorously. Then his expression changed to a rehearsed smile very fast.
“Look, I understood what you said before... about the chemicals released in climax.” John clenched and unclenched his left fist while he spoke. “So while I was waiting to call for Lestrade, I made a little research. I… studied Wilde in Uni and I remembered - I thought -”
and not looking over the internet. Even waking him up at this ridiculous hour. Deep inside, John got mad... but he got mad because he wasn't actually mad.
"Molly." John's statement wasn't a question or a surprised exclamation. It was just a name.
"Very good, Mr. Holmes. Now,
“Sher-”
Sherlock moved away, softly and casually almost brushing John's nose with his own, a little smirk on his face. It made John flinch silently. A knot formed inside the doctor's stomach and he hoped Lestrade didn't notice the change in his posture. If he did, he knew he would mock them for the rest of their lives.
"No, I'm not joking, John." He flipped around the channels and stretched over the couch.
sent at 04:56.
"The shave pattern below his Adam's apple was perfect. That can't be done by one self. Not in that way I mean, without cutting yourself in the process. It's almost anatomically impossible for a man who shakes so badly, you saw the way he wrote on the notepad, I observed before when he moved the mirror to look at us. So he has someone to do it for him. But what gave me more information was actually a picture of him holding hands with his partner next to the air freshener inside the car."
He found a note on the table, under an upside down cup. He took the note and read. A smile formed immediately on his face.
“If you have a… hunch not to believe it, then don’t.” Sherlock moved out of her reach, taking a single step back. “It’s usually your subconscious deducing at a speed your conscious self can’t. I’m counting on it.” Sherlock smiled at her and she smiled back again, wide and bright.
As soon as she closed the door, John became aware once more of the silence. It was heavy and disturbing. He wasn't used to this kind of silence. It was the same silence he remembered in the flat when Sherlock was knocked out by The Woman.
"I know, John, neither am I..." Sherlock lifted himself higher with his elbows trying to get closer to John, who didn't dare to move. "Yet now you're reacting to me..." then, he fixated his eyes in John's neck. There was a vein there, barely visible under the collar of his shirt. It was pumping vigorously. Sherlock seemed fascinated with it for a moment and then proceeded "I reckon telling you, John; it's a state of the mind. If you succeed in stimulate the mind the body acts on its own. I'm aroused not because you're a man, just because... you are..." Sherlock motioned with his hand, "you."
Sherlock had stopped writing, but there was no new message yet. John closed his eyes. Sherlock’s nipples came into view, now. Odd. That. Because he had never touched a man’s nipples like that before. There wasn’t a big difference to a woman’s, except what was below. Sherlock had a muscular body, even more so after his return, and his chest had been… it was a pleasant chest.
“I’m not. Don’t tell him I told you.”
“Nephew?” John and Martin asked at the same time, both of them looking between Sherlock and Wilson.
Armand tried to calm down. The man in front seemed almighty. He was at lost, his knees were still trembling but his position was firm.
"John... what are you wearing?"
"I'm sorry..." he said with a little smile. "I don't really... well I mean..."
What about his own physical reaction, then? What about the hard-on he had sported and successfully ignored the last half of the session? What did it say about himself? He was a grown man, he could ignore an erection! It’s not as if he had never considered… and maybe five years ago, before Sherlock disappeared, he would have… even though he had never thought about Sherlock as something more than…
"You know getting close to him is not good. James Moriarty wants him dead, ruined, you're aware of that..." he made a pause. Mycroft blinked slowly "...what am I saying, of course you're aware of that... it was you in the end who gave him the information about Holmes the younger."
Sherlock had awakened in the middle of those sensations. He didn't have a good night's sleep; instead he had been in a state of semi unconsciousness for hours. He could hear the dogs barking in the street and the wind hitting his window. But he could also feel the little show his mind was playing for him; John's hands, John's voice, John's deep breathing. But then, when the sensations were too much to bear, he opened his eyes and it was already clear in the morning. He couldn't hear the typical snoring coming from the bedroom above his. So Sherlock got up and walked to the kitchen, still wrapped in his sheet.
John's lips stayed in an
"You actually noticed how hard I was that time, didn't you, John." Sherlock kept on talking with the purred tone, sent shivers up to John's spine, "...just feeling your body pressed against mine... I also observed how agitated you were; I took your pulse when you touched my face."
"Right, yes. I have nothing planned for tomorrow. So I can go around doing everything you want me to."
"It wasn't a very difficult deduction."
“Ah, well…” John giggled, his high pitch dangerous in the dark and the cameras, he let go of Sherlock’s arm and he sat back quietly.
Sherlock looked where John’s hand held his upper arm, in fact, the muscles and now the veins were visible, too. What could he say? He relaxed, but he still felt his stomach tensed up. His penis had – to his mortification – completely firmed up as well.
Even though he had to think multiple times if John was thinking about the consequences, too.
Sherlock was already setting the table for him and John when Rosie finally replied “Daddy looks!”
A short throaty giggle resonated in the quiet space, the showery background noise became a little more intense. The lights at the street and in the port went on so the little drops were visible against the orange blur of the lights.
“Toby’s owner, you remember him? Lovely hound that helped us in the…” A dark shadow passed over John’s face. “Thatcher’s case,” he finished.
"The aftersh-?"
"Shut up." John had to gather all of his will power not to blush at the comment
“Are you okay, Mr Holmes?”
"You can count on that!" with a smirk and a gesture from Louis, the gang disappeared as fast as they've appeared.
Sherlock smiled back, he knew it was that goofy thing that made him look like a child, only one side of his mouth going up and his teeth showing up. He laid back in his original position on the stretcher and added, still smiling: “Do your worst”.
“Let me get this straight,” John said, reheating rice from yesterday’s lunch and opening the can of beans. “You are making Rosie smell the things you brought home from the spa?”
Sherlock’s smile reached his eyes. “Two hours,” he turned his face towards the door but his eyes were still on John’s.
When John thrusted again he had to bite his lower lip not to groan so he could just hear Sherlock. The sound coming from his lips was amazing on a whole new level, John had to clench his eyes not to come just from hearing that. He did it again and was rewarded with another sound, Sherlock's hand moved to John's buttocks, demanding speed and soon John noticed that Sherlock needed more pressure on his cock trapped between them, but he couldn’t do anything but press, utterly concentrated on just not to come, concentrated on hearing, observing.
"Yes." Sherlock said quickly, then he frowned again, confused.
Even so, the moments in silence inside the flat weren't awkward or heavy, even when sometimes John cursed his own body for its reactions whenever near the detective. His body hadn't had those reactions before…
"Silence is not the same without you, you know..." John said to the air, not turning the lights on.
In a matter of seconds, Sherlock noticed John was visible in the light so he switched positions quickly, pinning John to the wall on his right and back, the stair at his left and Sherlock in front. The detective was over him, protecting him, covering both with his large coat. His hands were supporting his weight on the wall behind, at both sides of John's head, so as not to fall on the doctor. John's hands were unconsciously grabbing Sherlock's shirt at chest height, trying to maintain their balance.
“Oh, you know.” Sherlock took off the heavy glasses, a red spot high on his nose, a smug grin playing around his mouth, “I have my charms.”
“What’s that?”
"John...?" he asked, John was about to answer but stopped when Sherlock hissed as soon as he spoke. He blinked a couple of times more and let his forehead fall over John's shoulder, letting out a pained moan. The headache was still there, a little more tolerable than last night, but still there. He rubbed a bit his face against John's shoulder in an attempt to ease the pain. John was almost petrified at Sherlock's action, but soon he knew that he still might be in pain and was just regaining consciousness; a combination he knew wasn't gratifying at all.
“No, neither did I…” Sherlock took a breath, looked at the screen with the countdown, and added, “Thirty-five minutes left.”
. It was only the second time in his life he had experienced that.
"You're my only friend." Sherlock stopped to look outside the window; neither of them had turned the light on and the one coming from outside seemed to suffice.
"Let's be blunt, then..." despite his heavy breathing and parted lips seeking for air, Sherlock managed a little smirk, his eyes fixed on the man’s beneath him.
The silence was deafening.
This was not good, he knew. He hadn’t masturbated to thoughts of John in a long time, not consciously at least. Even if he thought of John the few times he did it, he never actually
"It's very unlikely. Oh, you boys are so energetic, I want to be back your age so badly!" the cabbie laughed. "The abandoned building over there may be a little problem, sometimes, there are pickups that come and go... we believe they are drug dealers, not even the police dare to go there." Mr. Lawrence scratched his head and made a shrug. "They say that if you get to the end of the canal, right where the facility begins, they can even shoot you, something like a lawless town over there."
"You broke your diet today."
very calmed, his hands weren't shaking, but his eyes and facial expression proved him wrong.
Sherlock sat in his chair, eyes fixed on his phone. Rosie was sitting in John’s chair, a pretty dress on, also on her phone. Basically mirroring the man in front.
"I am going to pay you! I've saved enough, and I'm willing to pay the price. I just want to know the truth. Please..." John closed his lips tightly and eyed the man in front with a very resigned expression.
"That explains the drug's dealing rumours around here..." Sherlock eyed the canal in front and then he popped his head to see outside the barriers of the alley walls. He saw the abandoned factory and the possible route they had to take to get there. "But for now that information is irrelevant. I'm saving it for later use."
“I… I started to concentrate on what I wanted. You know what they say, don’t you? You don’t know what you have until you’ve lost it. When I noticed I could make you smile and laugh like before… I think I started to be… grateful?” He pulled a face. John smiled through his frown, his eyes were so very intent. “Also…” Sherlock sighed. He looked down. “Also…”
"At three o'clock in the morning?"
"The amount was minimal to get a reaction from you. You know I had to, John." He said, sitting next to the doctor, who remained lying down for a couple of seconds before sitting himself up. The detective sat with his feet over the couch and his knees to his chest. "What do you remember about the after effects?"
John thought with a smile. Being with Sherlock and talking his frustrations out really helped him to relax.
“Martin proposed to be your masseur.” The casserole started to boil. John reached behind him and turned it off.
"Actually, Sherlock... I can't tomorrow."
“But I don’t want it to be like this if I’m ever going to kiss you.”
He touched the hand softly and then brushed his fingertips all the way till the elbow. He noticed that John's hand was heavy, so was his arm. He pulled the covers down until the waist. John was wearing a buttoned grey pyjama; his chest rose and fell in harmony with his soft breathing.
John went back upstairs slowly, writing a text at the same time.
"Don't say my name, but keep talking." Sherlock whispered.
"No, you thought you saw it, John. What I mean is the
Slowly, his thumbs caressed the cheekbone and the little hollow forming below it, then he moved it to the eyebrow which flinched a bit by the contact, he travelled his thumb down and ghosted it over the parted pale lips. At that moment, he noticed his breathing had increased lightly at the sight. '
"Hello...?"
Sherlock narrowed his eyes briefly and just turned, he was about to hail a cab when a raspy voice called from the Yard's entry.
that?”
Sherlock smiled widely at him "We can't afford another misunderstanding now, can we?"
inside my mind's palace. We
Now, John was observing the outside of the cab from the window, trees passing one after another, flats, houses. Sherlock sat next to him, a frown on his features as he read the contents of a phone, his knees up in the air, close to his chest
"And... you are far more important than you think you are... after that, he counselled me to leave Baker Street... saying we both could get killed."
Sherlock hung up and placed the phone back into John's pocket. His head felt heavy and his stomach grumbled. He moved the blanket from his shoulders and threw it over both of them, feeling how cold John's hand was against his scalp. John moved unconsciously, placing his left hand over his own chest and finding Sherlock's hand in the process. The detective, feeling how cold it was, placed his hand over it, his headache making him go faster than usual into a slumber state.
John snapped his eyes open and his heart started to beat faster at the comment. He looked at the ceiling for an answer, but didn't find one.
Even if this was out of the usual menu, John felt oddly comfortable with the familiarity of the gesture. And surprisingly, even for himself, the first thought after he realised this, was: '
"How many?"
Sherlock hailed a cab to return to the lab, taking his phone and the sample of dirt in the process. It seemed to have little pieces of something resembling an onion. John answered his phone in the middle of the observing process.
at all. He was pleased with him, especially after he impersonated him so accurately some hours ago. And he was right. He was right about everything except that it wasn't him, but all of the other things he said: John had realised Mycroft and Irene had a relationship before. He knew they’d been talking about him and also knew he'd never had a sexual partner in his life and, of course, knew the exact reason behind that.
"I do trust you, Sir."
"Okay." He smiled tenderly at her and walked away, taking his phone again, he saw the last text.
"Why not?"
an international mafia case coming to you by mere casualty.”
"Thank you." The detective said finally.
"Armand."
” and pass her fingertips over his frown.
“Craig sent me a text last night with the names of the cameras. Each camera was named so if you rotate it 90 degrees…”
**..**
With one fluid movement, almost mirroring each other, both of them took a big gulp of beer. John grimaced when he tasted his dark one.
!" John screamed out loud and lowered his head to his hands. His own voice echoed against his ears and the shout kept on resonating inside his skull... it was almost painful.
John snorted, really, sometimes he just couldn't understand Sherlock. "As I told you, right here." He made pressure with his finger, and took his hand away, letting it rest over the sheet, "and it's connected to the hypothalamus, which has the connections for the nervous system... so if you stimulate part of the system, it is reflected in the hypophysis, which is in charge of releasing for example, all kind of hormones-"
Sherlock hadn’t moved.
"I'm fine." Sherlock cleared his throat and took a big gulp of air as he bended the collar of his coat up again, out of habit.
Chloe Hilton showed up at 9 pm behind a small tree, outside her and Elsie Patrick’s residence; a big house with a vast green area surrounding it. Even if it was clear she was the woman in the photos Sherlock had shown John earlier, the vitality she showed in them was lost to a pale face and weary eyes, even when her whole face came to life when her eyes fell on Sherlock.
"Come on, John. You're a handsome man and you could always be a gigolo, but I don't think you have the nerves to actually do it." Sherlock opened the flat's door and went downstairs.
After the conversation last night with John, he had been… tempted. To use a needle. He had wanted to stop feeling the hollow in the middle of his chest. He’d wanted the caress of something warm inside his veins, he wanted the tender sensation of his blood cells singing with something stronger. Of
His thoughts wondered to Mycroft again, he thought about the woman, about Armand, about the cases he couldn't write in his blog.
“It’s my voice,” Sherlock shrugged.
"What are you doing?" John got closer to the detective. He had his knees pressed to his chest, and his arms wrapped around them, trying to keep himself warm. He didn't pay much attention on how close they were, it was cold and the source of heat was welcomed.
"Sherlock... you were doing great..." John yawned and moved his hand over his mouth.
Sherlock smirked and lifted his gaze to John again. "Of course I am right. I told you, it's not Mrs. Hudson I'm concerned about."
"Nothing." He said answering her previous question, "the case just gave a huge turn... I can't talk about it, sorry." Sarah nodded and he stood up with his tray in hand. "I have to go now, Sarah, there are still lots of things to-".
room they would fit. But if he moved all of the data from John's room to
“She does!”
"Liar."
John thought.
**..**
John obeyed by default and was already giving Sherlock a wet flannel. “Why? What’s going on?”
"Well, you’re obviously the man for the role," Sherlock said with a tone of finality over his tea, voice shushed not to wake Rosie, his other hand holding a bunch of photographs.
"Do you want this to stop?"
“Or someone.”
“Our mouths were now in close contact, and still he did not kiss me; his lips were simply tantalising mine, as if to make me more keenly conscious of our nature's affinity.” Sherlock licked his lower lip slowly, as if savouring his own words.
"Good."
"Sherlock..." John sighed and blinked slowly. "I am not... gay..."
"That's why we need our client! It must be some kind of internal code...This is brilliant John! We must test this!" Sherlock saw the time in his watch, it was nearly nine p.m. and mumbled quickly "but not now, no. It's too early and the people who own the company and dragged the girls earlier must be still around the facilities. We must wait for a later hour, where most of them are asleep, so we can find the girls alone and phone them, since it's a twenty-four hours service. We're not calling now..." he added, his voice coming back to a normal speed "...we have to wait."
"Oh, about the new supplies that came in today. I signed them as the substitute doctor, but yet I found something strange about the drugs for the ontological department".
"Well sir, there are special services, but they are only for-" the call went off.
"Hello?"
Sherlock stilled in recognition of the text John was reading from his phone. He drew a quivering breath through his nose and was about to turn around when he remembered he just couldn’t with the way he jutted obscenely from his zipper. He tried to find John’s eyes in the reflection but the man was looking down, completely absorbed by what he was reading.
And Sherlock was delighted how, being both cases involved, he and John got to solve them without Donovan and Anderson behind them. Of course after that, the Sergeant and the criminalist had retaliated with the deerstalker hat and they had even go that far to convince a few friends from the press to push Sherlock to put it on for a picture.
"Kids!" Lestrade continued, not really paying attention to John, "don't do this at home! I think I should put a parental advisory in my movie..." the DI laughed again, just to be rewarded with another glare of the doctor on the floor. "Alright... alright, John. You win."
"How was not!
He thought of his own hands, then. Sometimes he would do that. He couldn’t help but remember how a few years ago when things were so messed up, when he had beaten Sherlock so bad that he had been left bleeding in a morgue floor, how his hands had hurt for days after, every time he flexed his fingers.
"I want to know everything. I'm going to ask questions now."
When Sherlock stepped into the kitchen, it was John's turn to claim the bathroom. Sherlock heard the door slam and, with fast moves, he grabbed five cans of beer from the fridge and placed them over the table. Then he turned on the kettle, he needed a cup of tea, who knows why. He also placed a cup, a spoon, sugar, everything at one side of the cans. Finally he supported his hip on the table and waited for John.
"You're right." Sherlock moved quickly, sitting in the leather chair in front of him. John opened wide eyes and sighed, rubbing his temples again.
"A book." He said breathlessly, moving his hand to turn on the faint orange glow of his night lamp.
"Okay." Molly's thumbs moved over her lavender phone.
" he lowered a little his voice for it was getting louder with every word "... that bitch calls you that, too. I've been willing to...
"So, you came here just for that?" John asked, amused at the situation. This was very, very new.
"It's transparent. I just need more data, Lestrade."
"Oh, yes. Sorry, come in." John had to fight a yawn. They walked upstairs. John was wondering what time it was. He knew it couldn't be so late in the afternoon. "Give me a minute please, you can wait here."
"How do you want me to ignore that I have my
When he had gotten closer to John, every time they shared the same space, he felt something in his mind palace. Mentally, he imagined the walls getting thicker around them. Sharing moments with the man in front of him seemed far from pointless. He enjoyed when John did something out of character, or how he could be worried about trivialities but at the same time, be focused on the deeper things around him. Of course, if John learned how to stop thinking about trivial things all the time, he could be a genius, even. But again, he wouldn't be here. He would have gotten himself killed after one day only in Afghanistan, and he would have never met him.
Sherlock felt his heart race in his chest, the tone, the intimate tone John was using held so much that Sherlock felt himself overwhelmed again. He didn't say a thing, he just waited, his lips parted to talk, but the only thing he could do was to wet his lower lip. John noticed that Sherlock was breathing through his mouth and that his face let his harsh facade fall for a second.
They both snorted and the silent that followed was filled up with their eyes. They observed each other faces, their breathing were normal now. John's face changed its expression several times, Sherlock knew John wanted to ask but he waited. He was getting good at it, after all.
. He ran to the bathroom again and this time he followed the pattern of the sweat, bringing the magnifying glass from his trousers' pocket to his face, observing himself carefully on the mirror. The pattern wasn't obvious to a normal naked eye; it was just a change in the way the drops should have fallen normally, going from his lower lip to his jaw. He swallowed nervously. He could only imagine the way John had touched him, he felt something fast going down his belly again.
“And the light in the room was very bright and hot.” Sherlock’s voice was nothing but a rumble and John shivered. He moved one knee between Sherlock’s thighs and felt a thrill like no other when those thighs were slowly and willingly being separated.
"John...
As soon as he got closer to Chloe and Elsie’s room, he sniffed out of curiosity at the new smell – a small part of his brain reproaching him, will he ever learn…! – He was hit by the strong scent of cinnamon, grass, lemon and parsley. All of them strong scents to cover for another. A sweet aroma underneath but completely unidentified. At the same time, Sherlock’s brain was processing Chloe’s
Sherlock sipped on his coffee again as if nothing had happened. "Uh... where are you planning to go?" he asked, not paying attention to Armand's lasts words.
Sherlock lifted his forehead from John's shoulder and gave a little step further, his chest was against John's back now. His chin was right next to John's temple.
“With her mother. I remember how nervous he was when she was around to check on her husband when he was in prison with Frank. She was young and I suppose she was aesthetically pleasing, for the usual standards.”
If you don't know who Armand might be, read chapter 7 again.
"Yeah... I thought at first that they might be family enemies. It's not difficult to find them when you belong to this kind of clans, you know, much less
"I see... I'll drop you at Angelo's and then, what else do I have to do?"
"I can't see it if you're this close..."
Armand grimaced shortly, his face returning back to normal immediately, he took a gulp of the tea John had offered earlier. The doctor really was somehow enchanted with the personality of the younger man, he was charming. He was the complete opposite to Sherlock and himself. He seemed clueless most of the time and reflected every emotion on his face. His speech and manners were sincere and the ambiguity in him was nonexistent; he was like an open book. But, according to what they've talked, John could also say how, even in his clueless nature, he was a very intelligent man. Armand seemed the type of person to follow his every need and instinct, not giving anything too much thought.
Sherlock slicked back his hair (amazing how a little touch to the hair could change the face so drastically), non-optical black-rimmed glasses, the comfortable, posh clothes were easy: thick black jeans, tight burgundy shirt, grey V-neck jumper (a sleeveless white vest below all that, just in case) and he was another person in front of the mirror.
"I thought that... I still do... you do need an audience, though."
He closed his eyes and entered his mind palace. He lay down on the mattress and evoked last night's sensations. They were all there; his mind had placed them all in a very organized way inside his palace. He realized there was a whole new room called
He started to spread the rest of the oil on Sherlock’s right bicep. It was a firm rub, detached. Still, Sherlock could feel John’s fingers as if they were entering his skin, he could have sworn that his breathing was audible three blocks away.
He entered the little space and waited. He clenched his jaw to release some of the tension; his heart racing in his chest and it was hard to breathe. He cursed mentally as his mind took the
"You okay there, Sherlock? Want anything?" as he got no answer, John poked his head out of the kitchen, with the lights of the street and his now dilated pupils, he was able to see Sherlock's silhouette, the faint layer of sweat over his neck and the way he was stretching uncomfortably over the couch. "Sherlock?"
He opened his eyes and continued the text.
"It's very likely that the people attacking you today were not people from the hot line."
received 21:18
"It's written all over you." Sherlock said with a shrug.
“Elsie Patrick is the daughter of his long-dead friend, also his goddaughter,” Sherlock said as he walked up a spiral staircase, John following right behind. “He swore to take care of what was left of his friend’s family because he felt guilty of the Patricks’ death. Long story short; he retired and silently followed Abby Slaney to  London; he sold everything, retired from the police force, bought this mansion with the money and kept on living off his hobby: jewellery.” Sherlock turned the lights on in a small room which was a studio covered in tools, small machines, raw pieces of silver, a few woodworks and, on a wooden board, a written replica of all of the dancing men Wilson Hargreave had made for Slaney’s Spa decoration.
behind them. That part of his brain was very aware that sex had become something vulgar and mundane. He didn't want it to be like that. It was like the word
"So I heard. It was chaos to try and contact you." Said Sherlock with a wide smile, pulling John even closer and moving his hand absently at the back of John's neck, the doctor cleared his throat to contain a giggle for Sherlock’s odd behaviour and his own embarrassment. According to the tone Sherlock was using, John quickly thought that he wouldn't be surprised if the detective suddenly said
John gave a loud snort and a headshake as he applied iodine over the injury.
,’ said mind-palace-Mycroft. ‘
“Mrs Hudson!” That was Sherlock’s scream, again. “We need ginger!” A pause only filled by Rosie’s continued laughter. “Powder or root!”
“You do that, with a lot of fuss if possible.” He winked. Mrs Hudson’s grin grew even wider in understanding.
Sherlock was in the process of checking stains on the said table when the ambulance arrived. John got startled where he was reading receipts on Elsie’s bedside table. They looked at each other and Sherlock made a gesture to the door. John just nodded and Sherlock made himself scarce.
John lifted his other arm and his hand nearly fell over his own face. He closed his eyes below his palm and snorted, then he giggled. His shoulders moved accordingly.
"I won't see you around, Mr. Holmes. It was good to never see you again." The man stated with a wider grin.
Armand opened big eyes, his right hand moved slowly to his forehead and pulled back his hair from his eyes, it seemed more like a typical gesture now to John. The violin music in the background was dramatic.
“Ah. Yes. Also, you moved back, with Rosie… and I want to be better for the both of you. I promised.”
She frowned. “Not much, but you can talk here just fine as long as you don’t raise your voice much because of the echo of this bare room.” She made a gesture with her hands at the empty space and smiled at John. “If you want anything to drink or eat before I go…”
“That’s why I’m here.”
His mind started to throw out little phrases from the conversation with John earlier,
"I know this man." Sherlock handled the picture of the same guy that stabbed him in the arm. Since he couldn't explain the homeless situation to Lestrade, he avoided the details.
, except two times:
"John Watson" he said smiling, offering his open hand.
And John found himself enjoying this; having Sherlock's body under control brought a strange mix of calm, joy and adrenaline to his own; there was something almost forbidden about this, and even if he wanted to, he couldn't just place the name for the emotions running through him. There was a tight knot in his stomach being this close to Sherlock. Besides, the way Sherlock was reacting to all this was driving him nuts. Again, one side of his mind wanted to step back, to never acknowledge this... yet the other part was winning over his will. Specially when he knuckled Sherlock's nape and perceived the soft breathing getting deeper... it left him with the desire to do more. Much more.
And a wink at the end. For drama.
His mind slowly entered his mind palace until he felt warm hands on his forehead.
They looked at each other, giggling shortly and soundlessly.
deduction, don't you think? People die and you know that, Sherlock. But you're still pained about death... you do care! You knew the cabbie, what was his name? You knew he was going to die and you felt sorry for him! Mixed sensations, isn't it? You're full of those; sorry for the cabbie and joy, of course, 'cause you figured it out."
her…" Sherlock stopped, again his face inches from John's, his voice deep and throaty, "…and every time you come home, you find an erotic scene with me and some random naked woman spread all over me… or
one of those times. Still, he couldn’t help but think of his favourite fantasy when he… indulged himself.
"John?" The DI had a devilish smirk which Sherlock obviously noticed, including the implication, but played fool.
There was silence on the other side of the line and the car came to a stop next to a bunch of bushes. The silence was only broken by the wind moving the bushes around. Sherlock looked at his phone comically, thinking he had just disconnected.
Sherlock lifted his gaze and smiled to the confused man in front. "For tonight it’s fine."
“Right, got it,” John said, nodding.
Alone would protect John this time. John's life.
"What the-" Sherlock lifted various items of clothes and turned to look at John with a fake glare. "Seriously, John. It was completely juvenile and unncal-" but he couldn't go on. John's expression was changing from surprised to a light chuckle and, as usual, Sherlock had this inevitable smirk on his face as well, soon his deep laughter echoed in the faintly illuminated room, he still on the floor, John still on the bed.
The simple thought gave him the chills. In his brain, the scene repeated again and again. Mycroft's voice, his posture, so carefree '
They were very close as they spoke. It was already natural, so many lines had already been crossed. Everything was so blurred it was easy to cross them again. Sherlock could reach out. He really could. He could ask for an encore or maybe just blame the residues. He could. He could reach out his hand and grab John by the shoulders. He said he would wait but then this morning he had put his face oh-so-close and John had let him. He could do that again, test the waters. See how far he could go. He could place his hands on John’s face to keep him there and just devour him. He could finally taste the mouth that had haunted so many of his dreams. He could finally put his nose next to John’s and just let them slide together and smell. Or maybe he could just grab John’s hands, intertwine their fingers and press his chest to John’s.
"Thank you very much, Mr..." Sherlock got closer to the paper "Mr. Lawrence is it?" the old cabbie smiled and nodded.
"Yes! In a restaurant. As a couple. Going to lunch. I think it would be very normal if you did. That's it!" John was whispering desperately.
Sherlock let out an exasperated sigh, apparently his patience had limits.
to know... you know, avoid surprises."
"Up to you. I need to go, now. Moriarty is out there and he can't know I am alive. I need to leave. I need to hide."
“I thought you were talking about massaging,” Sherlock said and had to swallow whatever it was inside his mouth.
"How can you know that?"
So, obediently, he walked to his room, shrugged off all of his remaining clothes and wrapped himself in a sheet.
"I am going to ask the same question,
There was
"John."
"John… thank you for taking care of me… and for thinking so highly of me." Sherlock's voice was deep but sweet. It had something John had never heard but it made his heart ache. He felt his chest burning at the simple but honest gesture.
"I am."
." Sherlock said, opening his palms in front of him. "The effect of the drug they gave me is similar. Only maybe... perfected..." he turned his torso to John in order to face him. "My senses were completely... taken. Not only was my mind playing tricks on me but also my other senses. Last night I couldn't move any part of my body, John... my eyes and my fingers were an exception. My biggest fear, my lack of control. You saw me last night, you saw I couldn't move." Sherlock blinked a couple of times, and looked around the flat, he was getting exited once more by the case.
Right at that moment, Elsie grabbed a glass jar full of clear liquid with a closed lid from behind her and held it in front of her face as a shield. They talked some more. Elsie was angry, her arms moving around frantically, the liquid inside the jar catching the light as she did so. Abby seemed calmer. She had the same confidence Sherlock had witnessed before in the spa.
"There is nothing to be sorry about, Armand." Sherlock never changed his position on the chair. "I didn't push you away because I wanted you to see for yourself. The sexual arousal state... it does come from the mind for me, even after physical stimulation, like you did. You just helped me prove another point. Maybe is not the same for everyone, but my body works the way my mind commands."
“It is! I can send a catalogue.” Martin stopped the car as they had arrived at Baker Street. He turned to look at him. “Please give me your number and I’ll send a message with a link to their website. They sell online.”
“Even?” Sherlock lifted his eyebrows. John took a deep breath.
"Yeah, but you
"What was that?" Lestrade asked as he watched his phone back into his hand.
"Well, you can think while we eat. And whilst we are at it, you're going to explain everything what happened today and all this... gang thing." John made a gesture with his hands.
Many thanks and kudos to my beta Lita Kelly!
Sherlock parted from the kiss and supported his forehead against the doctor's, both of them were panting lightly, the touch of their noses felt oddly intimate despite all the things they had already done. Sherlock met John's lips again, this time into a demanding kiss, eliciting a surprised groan from John's throat.
Smiling now, he sighed and allowed his mind to wonder free for a while. Maybe he needed a mind date again. Well, maybe since he and his mind – her – were at home, they could just hang out. He laughed at his own thought; he was starting to think like
John laughed aloud, “No, you moron.” He was left with the hand mid-air. “I was forced to listen to a small conference about the benefits of aloe when I went to Abby’s office to take the products,” he smiled and positioned his open palm on Sherlock’s warm back, the aloe gel liquefying at the contact between their skins. John stopped laughing.
like this. What if we get old? What if there is...?" there was a pause, "At first I thought you would only be my flatmate but now you see..."
"I will. You don't need to worry."
Sherlock eyed around the ceiling and Lestrade took the opportunity to close the laptop with the map, he took his handcuffs and walked to the woman.
"She is old enough, John... so maybe you can try and convince her to talk to her mother... or we can lure her to be seen by her mother. According to her parenthood profile, she still believes her daughter is a kid... but of course she's not."
"You seem..."
His mind supplied an image he had of Sherlock from many years ago; he had been on a date and, as soon as he had arrived, was lured by the screeching from Mrs Hudson’s kitchen. There was a mouse running loose inside her flat and she had called Sherlock, who had been sleeping, apparently. John entered the kitchen just to see Sherlock lifting a wooden table with his left hand as he threw a saucepan face down with the other over the grey little fellow. He had sleepily smiled at John with a, ‘
"Don't do that. That's exactly what I meant. Yeah."
Sherlock made a little frown when John started to toy with a little piece of fabric of his trouser. He was tapping and nailing his skin through it, and seemed completely unaware of his own actions.
The bulbs were imported from the Netherlands, and the black market's head was here in London.
"John." Sherlock gave a step closer to him, their faces were very close, but neither of them moved.
They followed her to a very big square room with high ceilings like the rest of the house but it had a huge picture window on one side facing the front yard and garage. The curtains were made of tulle so everything outside was visible from any part of the room without having to move the curtains to the side, but it also meant that any light in the room could be seen from the outside as well.
Doctor Watson was lying in bed, awake. It had been a long day... and it felt strange to be in the dark, in silence, without Sherlock.
"It's possible."
"Oh, great…" John muttered, he blinked slowly, his face tired.
There was noise downstairs; Mrs Hudson’s greetings and a soft voice asking for Mr Holmes. A few moments later Chloe Hilton sat in their client’s chair.
Lifting his arms to Sherlock's shirt, he grabbed the fabric there and felt the pressure of long fingers on his jaw, moving his face to close the space between them, Sherlock's expression was utterly serious and concentrated, his lips were parted seeking the much needed air. Then suddenly everything was turned upside down.
Also, the fact Molly had lunch with Sherlock was bothering him... a lot. Of course, he asked her politely to keep an eye on his food, but he never imagined Sherlock would actually agree to having lunch with her.
"Oh... shut up."
“And why is the missy dressed so nicely, hm?” John asked, kissing her soundly on her cheek.
Armand wasn't a man to get depressed or easily desperate, but it was the first time for him to feel threatened and confused and to be, in general, a chaotic mixture of feelings.
“Okay-”
"He is not responsible for Armand's disappearance, in case you're wondering." Mycroft rasped out with a little growl.
For a moment, John thought about going to sleep in his bed, but soon he decided against it. He was used to sleep anywhere and still manage a good night's sleep... he wanted to be near Sherlock, even if it was just for sharing the space like two kids, like this. Sherlock was right, it
His smile faded slowly until being completely erased from his face. Now: talk to John. It was the only possible solution. Knowing for sure that he was, unconsciously, searching for John's proximity he had to make a little experiment. Of course, John didn't have to know its track or results. He was certain he loved John, as a friend; felt the need to be close to him as he had experienced before, but certainly not that way. His mind must have been confusing things. He had to admit, that after all, even he could get the wrong idea sometimes.
"Okay, then. I’ll be seeing you soon. Make sure you don't get injured or shot... or... you know. Dead."
when his mind was in the middle of an enigma.
"Did you want me to stop you?"
initials. The position of it was different from the one on the logo. The vanilla smell was strong even though the window next to the desk was open. There was a faint smell to rosemary from the pot outside the window. Miss Eldridge’s necklace reflected the light coming through the open window and, just as John had mentioned the day before, it was a stick man in a different position then the stick man at the reception.
The way John was working was slow but firm, probably the job’s instructions. His hands were steady and soft. Sherlock congratulated himself again this time for the idea of wearing thick, dark jeans.
"Sherlock..."
"Oh, Lestrade also told me Sherlock knocked himself out on a desk..." Mrs. Hudson made a flinch and he smiled to give her assurance, "it's nothing serious... there was some blood, but there's only a little cut under the cheekbone, nothing else."
John got a little closer to Sherlock and he heard the already recognisable voice:
Mycroft frowned, his mind trying to connect the dots quickly, as he saw the man hanging up, he felt his phone vibrating in his pocket. Making an apologetic gesture with his face, he picked his phone.
"Are you going to enlighten me, what was all that about?" John saw how his breathing produced little white clouds in the air as he spoke, which only proved how cold it was.
"I can stand by myself... I dun need yar help!" Sherlock tried to stand up again just to fall back over poor John. This time, he groaned loudly at the pain at his lower belly. His face was red and contorted between pain and embarrassment.
John noted how every time Sherlock arrived to any place, the man appeared to float around the crowd, around tables and chairs and the very air. Sherlock soon was sitting in front.
He gave himself another stroke and the only word his mind could come up with was: “
There was a hand roaming down his chest now. Suddenly the feeling of wet clothe was replaced by the feeling of cool air around his naked skin. He tried to scream but a whimper was all he could manage.
And Sherlock now wanted to repeat that, he wanted to stand, grab John by his arm, turn him around, perhaps kiss him, with this new relationship they had. He wanted to tell him that he was right; that friends protect people and that was exactly was he was trying to do for his sake, for him, for them.
**..**
“Shlock!” Rosie called from the chair and Sherlock actually jumped a bit. The noise of a car stopping could be heard in front of the flat.
"You!" Sherlock glared at Lestrade, who was looking at them from his standing position a few steps away from them, his expression was unreadable. "That's what you wanted, didn't you Lestrade! You shot John!" He was holding John protectively, his eyes like ice. Surprisingly, the sentence was very comprehensible and he didn't even seem drugged. The DI was petrified at the scene, John was the same. "You never cared if John died right in front of you! I screamed for help but you never helped! You and your incompetents from the Yard! Those... those...
Apparently, tomorrow was going to be a very long day.
"This is big, Sherlock." Lestrade's voice was tired, a little brassy, "are you sure the painting is
And John did, his hand still over Sherlock’s panting mouth, face against his neck, licking the sweat he found, fingers finding Sherlock’s tongue and just realising Sherlock had moved his face to catch his fingers inside his mouth. He closed his eyes and felt Sherlock’s still hard penis against his belly and how Sherlock’s knees were bent and hips angled to feel his hardness closer to his… the mere thought of it made him see stars. He came so hard his own knees were about to give way if not for Sherlock’s hand keeping him in place.
Donovan glared to them when they made their way out, Sherlock walked fast, John noticed how he was abnormally alert as they approached the Yard's main door.
“Yes,” Sherlock said, smug. “The programmer they couldn’t contact anymore left us a huge clue with the camera names. He is also a good fighter.”
Soon Sherlock was browsing the contents of the phone; maybe he could find something useful there. After some minutes in silence, Armand lifted himself from the chair slowly.
"It... belongs to Richard Brook."
"Of course I had, is what I do." John giggled and soon the sound was followed by a deeper one.
A strange sense of déjà vu invaded the doctor; his memory travelled to the past for a few nanoseconds, and he saw himself walking in on Irene and Sherlock when she was naked in front of him. Sherlock had exactly the same expression; like saying
“Don’t touch her!” Elsie screamed between heavy breaths and mucus, her voice high-pitched and desperate in the middle of the quiet room and then told Martin: “I’m not leaving her alone! Not with two men in the house! Not in the state
Sherlock sat straight then, unbuttoned the remaining four buttons of the shirt and tossed it somewhere near the coffee table in front.
Molly went mute for a couple of seconds. Lestrade frowned and looked at his phone.
John noticed after a while, how Sherlock's legs stopped trembling under his own legs. He smiled satisfied. He wasn't very comfortable but he started to doze off slowly. At some point in his slumber, he felt Sherlock shifting his position and muttering something incomprehensible. He heard himself talking "It's okay Sherlock... it's okay" the only reply he got was a soft, throaty, but affirmative
“Does it!” Sherlock exclaimed and he quickly lifted Martin’s hand to his nose, inhaling deeply, holding it hard by the wrist and causing a gasp from Martin and a

The facility they reached was nothing like the usual quiet place it used to be; it was now surrounded by the force in every corner. Lestrade talked frantically by phone with someone when John and Sherlock arrived to the place. He gestured in the air and his voice was loud, now and then he would take the phone from his ear and roll his eyes to the sky.
"Talk to Jack. He'll return everything back to normal, the plan is settled."
“Oh.”
John frowned and looked at his friend, silently questioning.
“In a second, Watson!” Sherlock called, his eyes never leaving John’s. Clearly waiting for an answer, even though there were steps on the stairs that Sherlock could recognise everywhere. He didn’t move an inch.
"Who is that arse?" Louis asked pointing with his thumb over his shoulder.
Too many bottles. All of them where carefully labelled with a small sign for the main component. Most of the products had more than three natural components, many of them not even recognisable by smell. Hence the experiment-turned-into-game with Rosie. Wheeled table had four wheels; two of them had brakes and the others two didn’t. That was one more deduction than expected.
"Oh no, no. Armand, please." John darted his brows up, giving him a quizzical look.
“Lemon! Lemon!” She was shouting at the top of her lungs and then she sneezed, John could hear Sherlock’s new fit of laughter in the background.
Sherlock lifted himself from the bed, this time, there was no restrain. "Good night, John."
“Play for me then, when we’re home. For us. I’m sure Rosie misses it.”
“Yes, that’s it.” John was aware of the doctorly tone until he felt the movement of Sherlock’s arm. He looked down at his phone again and cleared his throat loudly in the otherwise silent bathroom. “With someone whose mere personality was so, so fucking fascinating that…”
Sherlock snorted softly. There was caution in those eyes and John felt like he had to put a seatbelt on.
"Okay." Armand made his way to the door. His walking pace was secure and his movements smooth. He moved a bit like Sherlock, but not as gracious, as John noticed. "And... Dr. Watson?"
“Not always is.”
Click.
"You did notice, didn't you, John?" John nodded. He’d caught a glimpse of the prisoner telling the truth, but maybe it was just his guts. He was sure, though, that Sherlock had seen much more.
"Look, Sherlock, I'm sorry. I shouldn't…" he pressed the delete key of his laptop.
There was a pregnant silence. Sherlock swallowed and bit his lips from the inside, fumbled with his phone, cleared his throat again and said, “Did you notice every room is marked with a letter?”
"What? What have I done?" She eyed the ceiling, playing innocent.
"Alright..." Sherlock still had a little smile on his face, "I promise not to be so loud this time." They laughed again.
Wilson nodded and started to talk to Sherlock, who gave him back his phone. Wilson asked for Sherlock’s number and Sherlock, politely, asked for his too. They walked as they talked. Martin turned to fill out a few pieces of paper. John sighed and took his phone. He yawned when he saw the time and, when he turned the screen on, he saw the text he had been reading to Sherlock earlier. He reread the whole thing, his face red and continued to read part of the site.
“The case is solved, John, it’s all too obvious. Now we need to find out about Elsie and her protector, coincidences and codes!” Sherlock all but shouted exasperatedly, both hands in the air.
“Then I won’t,” Sherlock replied, rolling his hips softly once, soft enough to let himself feel the touch of the towel, but not hard for it to fall off and leave him exposed.

He paced the flat a couple of times, looking for something, anything to keep him occupied. He walked down to the entry where his coat was hanging, took the crisps he’d got on his way back from Craig’s, went back to the living room, sat on his chair, and ate like a starved man. He was absurdly ravenous; had even eaten half of the croutons earlier, too (much to Mrs Hudson’s delight). The crisps were gone all too soon and he carelessly left the empty package on the table next to him, where he had another glass of water waiting. He drank half of it in one go.
"Close friends."
again who had started the entire thing about his sexual issues. But he'd never imagined Sherlock would take it at heart like that. Little red evil-John, over his left shoulder, was telling him he could play the game of seduction with Sherlock too... he was the most experienced of the two after all. Yes. He could just test how far Sherlock is willing to take this. Little white-John answered it was not good to sexually impose your friend... hell, very
They finished their tea in silence until a text alert took them from their reverie. Sherlock’s smile grew wide while he read it and showed the screen to John after.
"I recommend you to go as far from the canal as possible, try to keep your heads down. If things get too
John’s smile was tender as he lifted his index finger in the air as if waiting for something. Ten seconds passed, Sherlock made another attempt to free his arm when a very loud moan - Chloe’s - was heard from upstairs, clearly letting them know what was going on so not to be interrupted. The message was very clear to John.
When Armand saw John, he explained immediately how he had been attacked, as soon as he got to his home, and how he had escaped. Sherlock realized the man wasn't talking about the phone...
That tone made him turn around completely, slowly. He froze at the scene in front of him, he felt himself blushing from head to toe.
John’s brows darted up and his little smile turned into a light chuckle, it was soon followed by a deep one from his companion. His shoulders couldn't stop shaking with it. Soon he and Sherlock were doubled over laughing. Every time they looked at each other the laughter became more uncontrollable. John tried to form words.
where she came from and I suppose you
"What?" John frowned but there was a little amused smile there too.
**..**
It was an incredible sensation at being half dressed next to a fully naked body. John stared up and tilted his head up, placing a soft kiss over Sherlock's lips, he trailed little kisses over the exposed neck and then brushed his lips over Sherlock's collarbones. An animalistic sound let the detective's throat when John nibbled his Adam's apple. John shivered at that. One of Sherlock's hands moved to John's waistband and, kicking his shoes off, John helped with his own button and zipper, the item of clothe soon discarded somewhere over the floor.
"The... case..." Sherlock repeated absentmindly. When he finally reached the last page he read aloud, "passionate crime, hot line facilities, people with accent... really John..." he added looking over at his friend, "I wasn't lying when I said you should become a professional author..."
The detective lifted his head slowly to look at him. There was a side smile on his lips, he stared into John's eyes again. "Yes." Sherlock said, his voice throaty and almost whispered "You put up with me just fine."
"About last night..." Sherlock eyed John not moving his head. It was the first time he was in this situation. He had thanked for this new case to keep his mind busy. But he knew John, he also knew that he couldn't escape the inevitable, so he just listened, John sighed and proceeded, "... when I told you that I'm not gay... you told me you weren't either..."
"No. I was stabbed by a new homeless gang." Sherlock started to unwrap his arm and smiled, "but the other bloke is part of the net now." Sherlock eyed John who was coming out from the bathroom frowning. "What were you thinking about, you seem upset."
So he took a deep breath, cleared his throat and used a firm voice. “Look. It was intended for William to act like that.” Maybe if he tried to extrapolate a bit the whole situation. “And it was intended for Hamish to touch William like that. We…” he sighed, his smile softening as he said, “We followed the rules as we always do in cases. Though I have to admit that somehow I doubt there will be another case that
"Okay. Well, just wait here, Sherlock is, uh... I mean, we can discuss the case meanwhile, but you must know, he is the one to decide if the case will be taken or not."
His treacherous mind supplied a track of Sherlock’s voice instead, his quick panting, his soft groans. That – rather spectacular – first moan that had escaped his lips in the massage room completely uncensored, completely pornographic.

“Seriously, John. Your phone? What could you possibly-?”
“Tonight, if you want. The leaf is already cut so I should think… where’s the leaf?” John looked around the kitchen.
"God, Sherlock. It looks pretty bad." As John started to clean the wound, he noticed Sherlock was distracted. "You really
"Thank you! Don't forget to warn them: do not touch the surfaces. Dust is fluent, leave the dust intact."
“Okay,” he said softly, “remove your shirt.”
“And lots of flirting with the receptionist, I see,” John said with a smile, keeping things light.
"And that thing I told you last night... about that never happening to me before... it's... completely true." Sherlock opened his eyes again, scanning John's face. He took a hold of the furious red in John's temple, starting at some point in his body, going up by his neck and ending in his cheeks. John's lips were firmly sealed but his nose flared allowing the entry to the extra air his brain needed, but his hands kept on working firmly on his shoulders and neck.
"And how did you know she really wasn't in love with him?" John was curious about the situation, forgetting almost completely to congratulate himself for being
Sherlock lifted his hand slowly, shaking all the more noticeable but he didn’t stop. He remained in his chair and grabbed John’s forearm, his thumb unconsciously rubbing a soothing pattern on John’s jumper. All of his being was screaming to comfort the man in front.
“I know. I know.” He grabbed the cups and sat on the chair opposite Sherlock. He left Sherlock’s cup within reach.
There was something in the Yarder that John found fairly familiar. He was in his early thirties and a bright-looking bloke with cheerful eyes, broad shoulders and thin waist, things that John noticed first. The ratio between waist and shoulders should have been completely anti-aesthetical but for some reason, it wasn’t. “Oh, Ham- Dr Watson!”
“After that, I suppose he was hopeful when Elsie’s father died but she was faithful even after his death. He was in very serious business with Frank Hudson, though.”
“My face is already recognisable. You, on the other hand…”
And Sherlock did. '
"John…!"
He placed a camera in front of him and turned on the light of his desk. He eyed around Bart's IT department. It was dark except for that new light and the lights from the security monitors. He saw Molly Hooper coming out from the mortuary, ending her shift later than usual. He touched the screen with a faked pout.
"No. No, I don't think we have." She turned a bit to face him directly this time. Sherlock and Lestrade were talking in the background about a new photograph taken by Anderson. John was focused on the girl, while never taking his mind off the case; he didn't miss a detail of Sherlock and Lestrade's conversation.
The Holding (Sherlock’s name) always brought only sad memories (his ribs have been hurting, his eye had still been blurry, his hands were still shaking), so he never really counted that, since it was him holding – comforting - John in a not so particularly platonic way.
Sherlock's lips curved a little and they stayed in the same position for a couple of minutes. None of them wanted to interrupt the loved tranquillity they shared, but soon Sherlock broke the silence.

was the one that had given Craig access to the photographs, the thermal cameras and the names of most of them.
exposed to John more than he ever wanted to know about his flatmate. Especially after Mycroft's little comment
"I know... it itches." Sherlock's voice held a little amusement, his lips curved in a gently smile, oblivious on purpose to John's change of topic.
"Consider it done."
"You can't, apparently."
Sherlock seemed a bit uneasy, John knew what was going on inside his head, and they really needed to talk about it.
Sherlock glared down but he stayed in the position, thinning his lips quickly he said "Mycroft was here last night." He frowned deeply and slowly he added "
Now, he was in a pub-bar near Baker Street. Alone, a beer in his hand, loud music penetrating his ears and loud bass resonating inside his rib cage.
' his mind spoke what his lips didn't dare to let out, '
she doesn’t like people, either.”
"Oh God... I'm so sorry, Sherlock..." he said between gasps. Just by watching Sherlock's face he froze by the ninth time today at the view. Sherlock's skin was flushed with a furious red, his eyes were dark, usually pale lips red from the long kiss, parted seeking for air. There was little amused smile there, too.
Sherlock observed the card and John got closer to it. It just said 'Armand Smith, 0212020011901' and a bar code.
"Sherlock..."
"Right." John made them tea and again, there it was: the comfortable silence. It was only disturbed by the noise of the news’ channel. There was a reporter with a very anxious voice, throwing away the news about a minor earthquake in South America.
It looked less fake than that of the actors, at least.
“Sorry. Hello, yes. Call me Martin.” He presented his hand for a handshake. "It’s an honour to meet you, sir."
"Of course... and I'm sure you know it as well."
**..**
How many times his erection had twitched under the towel he could no longer count.
“A message from Craig with access to the cameras, obviously,” Sherlock said as he sent a thumbs up symbol to Craig’s message – John was forever amused how Sherlock started to send a thumbs up whenever he didn’t want to reply to something – and opened an app on his phone.
"Well…" the doctor started, "that... would be a little awkward, and you should actually do that kind of stuff in your bedroom, you know, behind closed doors." John cleared his throat once more and locked his eyes on his partner's. Sherlock slowly moved his face a millimetre closer.
“Sher-”
"No I mean... you're
Sherlock sighed audibly.
"You like that, uh?" he asked casually, his own voice was a throaty mumble. His thumbs still massaged there, softer this time.
Craig eyed Sherlock suspiciously who just shrugged and, as soon as John was inside the office, he stood up making a big fuss with the chair.
"John..." Sherlock placed both hands on John's jaw, cupping his face.
"Who else."
"You will." '
And, as if by command, John came hard, Sherlock's middle finger stroked the entrance as John's quivered beneath him. His orgasm hitting him hard, he rocked his hips against Sherlock and the movement of his lower half made the sensation all the more enticing. Sherlock was still rock hard and his hips moved rapidly as well as his finger, John found himself pressing his hips up against Sherlock's; his back arched and his grip on the detective's skin was almost impossible to abide. He was pretty sure he would leave marks afterwards.
John lifted an eyebrow at the expectant face in front. "What is this?"
He wanted to go to John's room. He wanted to talk to him,
"Oh, it's not important. I need to talk to him." Sherlock finished the knot, it was one of those knots people usually use to hang themselves. John was so used to weird things that he surprised himself when he didn't even asked about Sherlock's doings.
"Oh. So you think I'm a genius?" Sherlock smirked.
Abby looked up to Sherlock’s face and gasped in understanding. “I should have known,” she said, very calm. “Sherlock Holmes and Doctor Watson. I knew your names but I didn’t know your faces. Stupid of me of not doing research beforehand.”
"No." It was only a question, of course he couldn't, nobody could answer that question. Perhaps not even Sherlock himself, now that he thought about it. What would have been Sherlock's answer? "Sorry, I can't."
"Make it four, dear brother... make it four."
"Personality...!" Sherlock snorted at that. It was a sad laugh. John got it right away:
"I don't."
He loved that... the
“No. I’m okay.” Sherlock closed his eyes for a second and evoked William Scott’s personality, not really getting it but close. “Just…” he gestured to his body with a flourish of his hand and added, “Do whatever it is you have to do,
He took a breath through his nose when John massaged up the back of his knees with his thumbs.

a man."
"Oh. Well, you should tell your friend you prefer pink over lavender, don't you think? Aha! There you are, you bloody drug trace, almost fading, but there you are…"
Sherlock pressed two. If he was talking to someone, he thought that the voice of a more mature woman could sound better.
As he was doing that he felt John's hand over his hair, pulling. He froze. He removed the tip from his lips and looked over at John. The doctor had his back arched, he was panting really hard and loudly and Sherlock noticed that he had been sucking the tip of John's cock with his eyes closed and all of the other senses had stopped functioning somehow. He stared at the figure below him, taking in John's sounds - God he loved to hear John's moans and those strangled sounds coming from his throat.
, John thought – but they were shaking uncontrollably… it was hard to say if it was because of the cold air or the nervousness both of them were feeling; they were both breathing hard again, but this time for completely different reasons. Sherlock moved John's hand near his lips and planted a chaste kiss over the palm. The gesture made John feel so vulnerable he couldn't speak; he couldn't help but stare into those eyes that were staring back into his very soul, and couldn't help but notice how Sherlock's body reacted to the closeness.
"Look at this…" John took his own notebook from his pocket, searched for a page and handed it to Sherlock "…it's our client's
Hello! Chapter 3 here! I hope you enjoy this as much as I enjoy writing it. Thank you for your kudos and comments. I really appreciate the support.
“Sherlock.”
“Well. Surprisingly, I got the job,” John announced as soon as he entered the flat. His now-client, William Scott, was dressed in the camel-coloured dressing gown, one arm around Rosie against his hip, looking at a series of photos of stick man necklaces. John got closer to look at the pictures and added, “Miss Eldridge had one of those, too.”
As soon as John turned on the kettle, there was a loud shout from Sherlock's bedroom. The voice was calling for him. Again.
He turned to his side.
"What?" the man repeated a little high pitched.
**..**
As soon as the door was closed, Mrs. Hudson's voice sounded from the first store
"Wood... and cedar... a light touch of tobacco..." he continued, his voice was merely above a whisper.
"A lawless town, John, I knew that. I also noted the cabbie was a homosexual man, he has an established relationship with a younger man. I didn't know what the man was talking about though, but it was a good way to obtain information. And
"Remember, Sherlock. We're not heroes here, we just need enough evidence. We're not going to catch them without the specialists, it's too dangerous and there is too much at stake to risk it all." Lestrade said at the end, getting a glare from the detective as a reward.
"Correct."
James Moriarty hung up and placed his headphones back. Sherlock's voice echoed in them, low, dark, whispered, purred voice.
"You want me to text him for you?"
“You wanted me to explain part of the case now, I could hear you thinking about it,” John’s lips curled at that. “The cameras were dancing men, like the necklaces and the logo of the Spa. Look at this.”
**..**
He left the violin on his chair and fled to his room, closed the door as silent as he could and stripped himself, sighing in relief when his penis was no longer trapped in his clothes.
Sherlock's softened features were slowly replaced by a frown again. He didn't want to give so much thought to the case today. He had recognized Moriarty's doing; he knew that, as a consulting criminal, he was behind the drugs and Mycroft was trying to hunt him down. Sherlock knew the criminal mind needed attention, he was aware of that. He constantly said that he loved those... mostly because he loved the expression of deception and triumph at the same time on their faces when they found someone clever than them, someone who was able to track them down. He had become a detective to help out; he knew he could use his
, then John's voice talking to Lestrade, asking about Armand. Suddenly Armand's voice resonated inside his mind palace, it was dark, John sleeping beneath him, a soft caress on his scalp.
“John?” He felt hands on his shoulders. John was behind him, trying to make him turn around.
“The new one.”
Sherlock fell back to his pensive state, ignoring John when he turned, muttered a "right" and went to his room.
Sherlock answered quickly.
There was an experiment he thought about last night, and for that, he needed to be... unaccompanied.
"Yes, I know, John, but Mycroft is a completely different story, you know… his mind works like mine."
With a mouthful, he typed with his index finger.
"Excellent." Sherlock jumped from his chair and practically ran to the front door. John and the landlady shared a look and then a soft chuckle.
And again, there were no labels for this. Oddly enough, he didn't feel
and there. In his mind, the word '
"Sherlock?"
John frowned at the paper, his eyes moving along the names of the cameras. “That…”
Received at 5:23
Neither of them knew how many minutes it lasted, neither of them noticed when John moved his hands to cup Sherlock's face, and neither noticed the moment in which Sherlock let his little ball inside his jacket's pocket to hold John's face and neck with both of his hands.
"Sherlock..."
"I don't think so..." the young man said scratching his head, "I ran a lot, really, and hailed at least four cabs to distract them. Then I walked in every possible direction until I got here." Armand searched in his jacket's pocket and he passed Sherlock a card, the detective motioned to a chair near the window making him sit, John sat in his usual chair. Sherlock placed the laptop aside and joined in the conversation about to begin.
When he was about to finish the entry he remembered something he just felt he had to write down.
Sherlock legs tangled around his waist and John kissed Sherlock at that, it was messy at first but soon Sherlock's hands moved to his face, cupping John's jaw and kissing him slowly and softly. Deep in the back of John's mind, what he thought it would be chaotic, passionate and desperate, surprisingly ended in a sensual love making, as they moved and kissed, John couldn't separate his eyes from Sherlock's expression.
Sherlock held his phone in front of John and they both watched on the thermal cameras as a woman – Abby, going by the shape of her hairdo – checked her phone, stood up from her desk and walked to the exit.
"Go and make it yourself, Sherlock."
She took the opportunity to plant her foot over Sherlock's chest and threw him backwards, giving herself the impulse she needed to get to the other side of the wall, but Sherlock managed to get the laptop and get back to his feet quickly, helped by Lestrade, shaking his head and making an aggrieved face.
"Sherlock, if you want a massage so badly, you just have to ask for it, really." John turned to face him and gave a short headshake, "Now I am really worried, you might have something serious, the crack sound was awful last time. I'm not joking here... set aside your loud cry."
"It's everything okay?" John asked as he walked rapidly, trying to match Sherlock's pace.
John found himself looking at the floor for a long time, pursing his lips to a side. Words that failed to cross the passage of his mouth, forming a knot in his throat. He lifted his eyes to look at Sherlock, his eyes felt heavy and his neck was hurting, his back was a hell and a whole different problem, but he didn't care.
… There was a crash at the end of the hallway. Just on time.
Sherlock placed his other hand over John's. It was a nice feeling, he felt then the pulse below the thumb of the doctor.
About half an hour passed when Elsie came down the stairs with notes in her hands and a few small jars full of liquid and white cream. She passed them to Abby to inspect. Both women were whispering too softly for John and Sherlock to hear therefore they stared intently at the cameras on Sherlock’s phone.
Sherlock laughed genuinely at this. He had asked John to erase those photographs from the blog, but the blogger had insisted:
Feelings he didn't held towards the people on the phone. There was no other possible explanation, he knew he felt something strong for John, he knew and was well aware of the fact that he actually...
"Now the case is personal, Sherlock..." Lestrade rubbed his temples and this time he fully looked up. "I believe the government might be involved in this one, so I cannot tell my people to track it down."
John's smile was once again replaced by a bitter smile. Sherlock
,” Sherlock smiled softly and let John’s hands go. He buttoned his shirt up and before John could say anything he turned to the glass door. “I heard the process of tea making and I’m ravenous. Coming?” He winked at John and left the bathroom.
In his usual order of things, he tried to create a list of his feelings, similar to the list he had prepared when he had first met the detective; the list about his fields of knowledge. He smiled at himself. Exactly. He was fascinated with Sherlock since the very first moment; he wanted to know more about the detective since that first meeting at Bart’s. Why would he ever deny that if as soon as he met him, he couldn't take him off his head? His world was secluded to him, he orbited the man...
“No. No… I don’t know. Abby usually comes here with…” Suddenly Elsie’s face lost all colour and she freed herself from Sherlock’s grip and started to run upstairs, “Chloe? Chloe!”
"Shh!" John put his hand over Sherlock's thigh and squeezed lightly, making a gesture with his other hand; placing his index finger over his own lips as a warning to be silent. Then he moved his finger and pointed to the mist in front. As soon as Sherlock lifted his gaze to follow John's finger, he saw people walking. John's senses were sharp, so he saw the movement in the fog before the people appeared at plain sight.
**..**
“That’s… unfortunate. You said you wouldn’t massage
"So, Chinese? Italian?" Sherlock was walking away again. John shook his head and tried to calm his breathing. If Sherlock saw it or not he never knew; he put his index and middle finger on his left wrist and checked his pulse. It was going too fast. His mouth felt dry and, once again, he cleared his throat.
His brain was still processing, he knew what he was going to find inside the room, so it wasn’t really a surprise when he saw Sidney Eldridge pouring liquid after liquid onto the bed. Chloe was deeply asleep, obviously sedated and naked below the sheets.
happened in 2010 when she moved to a temporary home in Cherry Hill, Philadelphia. She stayed in a charity home and then she came to London. Why charity? She’s a chemist, she had plenty of job opportunities but she preferred to keep a low profile. Then she met Hilton, they moved in together and, well,” Sherlock made a gesture with his phone in the other room direction, “you know the rest.”
"Sherlock?"
Sherlock curled up on his chair. His eyes felt heavy, even when he had slept several nights on a row. He was aware about Mycroft's reasoning being the right one, but he couldn't understand why he had to be destroyed.
"Yeah, consider it done. We'll keep you updated." The tall man who was talking to Sherlock eyed John and lifted his brows.
"I went to the yard and stopped by at Armand's." Sherlock replied with a groan, throwing himself to the couch next to John. "No, not cold."
"Found it. Meet me at the crime scene in one hour."
"Why? I mean... you aren't capable of...?"
Sherlock giggled at this, the action made the bed jump a little, the muscles in his back moved lightly. John followed with a snort before pouring some lotion over Sherlock's back. The detective hissed at the cold.
John was worried; he didn't want to freak Sherlock out. He didn't want to bring back the repulsion he had for sexual interaction. It was his biggest fear right now. John changed his position on the bed by supporting himself with his elbow instead of hand next to Sherlock's head, making the position even more intimate. With that hand free, he moved lightly his fingers over Sherlock's cheekbones, his lips, his nose, resting finally on his forehead moving the hair back. Sherlock was panting lightly but lifted his brows at John's concern. It was all John's needed. With confident movements, he mimicked Sherlock's pace on his own.
Sherlock knew what was coming; the only way to stop Moriarty was being gone.
There were feet coming up the stairs – clearly John’s now – and Sherlock panicked a bit. His eyes went straight to the door and Martin skilfully changed the subject.
“That’s not what I- look.” John turned around, the stove was still on. “What happened?”
Armand walked to the sofa. Sherlock didn't reply, he didn't know how.
"Sir?" Sergeant Sally Donovan got closer to the DI. He smiled at her, she was someone he could definitely trust, but he knew her way of thinking about Sherlock's methods. She, like almost all of the people he worked with, didn't trust the detective and would never admit, maybe out of pride, how an
“Oh, dear.”
Before John could add
"They already do… and I don't care since it is... you know. Pleasant."
"Yes? How would you like the coffee?" he asked, remembering a post from John's blog, saying Sherlock drank his coffee with sugar, just to make sure.
“You see, in computer coding, there are many ways to store data; so this is a code; the equal signs tell us it’s a system called base64, with this, we can get part of the letter, so the first camera in each room is coded that way. Both of your cameras, for example, give us 0, 6, R, 6 and 4. That’s the letter D that’s on your door, remember? Since all letters start with zero in the binary system they all start with the letter O. You see?” Sherlock had started to gesticulate with his hands, his cup precariously holding the tea in, clearly excited about his discovery. “Then the letter D decoded in decimal is 68, in base64 is RA, and the octal code is 104, there is a repeated number in each, but it’s because it’s twice in the same number in the base64…”
In a hospital cafeteria, John Watson sat in front of his lunch, completely unaware about Sherlock whereabouts today since he had left the flat early in the morning.
