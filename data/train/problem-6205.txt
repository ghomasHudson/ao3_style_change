He sighed heavily.
Tony has a breakthrough.
“Yes Boss!”
Steve was about to fall into a deeper sleep until Johnny nudged him.  Steve looked up at him and realized he was staring off to the city.
One needed the patients of a saint to deal with Tony at times. How on earth was Pepper ever able to do it for so many years? No one may ever know. Tony’s laughs started to die down some.
“In addition to that you, Captain Rogers, are not allowed to leave.”
“We’ll surrender quietly, just please, don’t let him die.” Steve pleaded fresh tears ran down his face despite his best efforts at keeping them at bay.
He felt a strong grasp on his shoulder and turned to see Barnes smiling at him. “You did it.” He commended.
Tony gently prodded the flesh next to the anchor wall and was entirely pleased to see a perfect merger even better than his own arc reactor socket wall. He had considered letting the Doc check out his socket wall, then thought better of it. He’ll just design a technology similar to Dr. Cho’s sometime later on, that is, if they all survive this.
"Okay." Steve nodded politely and paid the man.
"Sure is, they're right over here." She indicated that they follow her to the reserved section. "It's these two here." She said pointing to two large rolls of pale blue and yellow fabric.
Steve and Ellie followed her into the kitchen. Peggy wrote down the directions on a piece of paper.
Tony did not know how it was possible that Steve was here, fighting with them, leading them. He did not want to fathom what it truly meant to have Steve with them right here, right now, knowing what Calamity’s aim was…
“Okay!”
“It is difficult to say, Sir, more lucid than not I suspect, however.” Jarvis replied.
Tony rolled his eyes. “You don’t have to get in it, look.”
Steve thought for a moment. "When I put the Valkyrie down into the water."
Steve had decidedly thought it to be a good idea to make twenty seven pies.  Good thing too, once the scent of apple pies baking wafted around the compound, many people emerged from their niches and followed the smell.  One by one people had wandered into the kitchen to figure out the source of that divined smell.
“It seems our foe found some new targets.”  Beast stated with despair.
He leaned over and gave her a lingering kiss.
The car ride back home was quiet but comfortable. Ellie was busy counting the trees as they drove by them and Steve took that time to reflect on the last couple days. Even more so on the events of that day in particular. It was, to be Frank, a lot of information to absorb. He could not even begin to understand his outburst from earlier in regards to the unfortunate condition his friend was in.
"Okay, Babydoll. You ready for breakfast?" He asked looking down at her tear streaked face as she continued to break out into giggles.
Steve’s eyebrows rose dramatically. “Really? He must be damn serious about this woman.”
"I love you… Steve."
Somehow that description did not seem quite right then.
His team did not deserve the way he bailed on them. He winced thinking back on the lengths he went through to escape. He drugged Jane and Darcy. That was bad. He knocked out Scott and Colson. Probably the two people least deserving of his attack. And Natasha… Now that he has had a moment to breathe he recalled that conversation with her all those weeks ago.
Then suddenly he was back.
Heart… Artificial heart… Someone with an artificial heart… He holds his heart.
Bucky had successfully pinned Steve underneath him as he continued to read. His expression morphed from mischief to utter disappointment.
He didn't even know her name.
They began their trek to a part of the city that was an old industrial district. It was even harder to move unseen this time. It was midday now and the city was wide awake. Thousands upon thousands of people hustling about busy living their lives. With so many people milling about Steve knew it would be a matter of time before Jarvis and in those regards Tony found them. All it would take was one well snapped selfie from an un-aware civilian with the Captain in the background.
Chapter Thirty-One: Lullaby Under The Stars And Stripes
He pressed his hands deeper into the phantom pain until it screamed back sharply for a moment. The flying suit of armor from his dreams flashed into his mind. Somehow, despite everything it was oddly comforting.
“Look at the two of us. Two pitiful walking disasters, cursing the wretched path life paved for us, all the while regretting each step we take. We make quite a pair, don’t we?” Bucky mused, his voice thick as gravel.
Steve pressed his forehead against the cool door trying to get a grip over his warring emotions. Tears started to roll down his face without permission. He was shaking almost violently.
"Oh my God, the baby's coming."
He was falling for Tony Stark.  And that thought alone scared him more profoundly then anything ever has in his entire life.  He shuffled slowly to his bed removing the various protective garments along the way.  He plopped down onto the bed with dismal abandon.  Face planting into his pillow.  He let out a tortured groan that reverberated through his entire being and allowed his thoughts to take over.
Tony watched as he darted rooftop to rooftop trying to get ahead of these guys. Tony analyzed the situation. He needed to shield the people from Rhododendron and his lackeys.
“You got that, Jarvis?” Tony said instead, pulling his phone out again. “Put Graham on the tracking algorithm.”
"Everything is going to be fine, Stark," He murmured with an eerie calm. "You said it yourself…" He picked up a rock.
“Ah, quit, the stitches are fine.” Steve nearly squealed, pushing Tony’s hands away. “Yes,” he said continuing. “You are right about ‘some’ things.”
“Of course it is.” The genius whispered.
Steve was still full of shock after everything that had transpired that morning.  He was of little use and he hated it.  He dug up a sketchbook and made his way to the lab in which Tony, Hank and Bruce were working.  Tony along with Hank had already sat down with the Professor to go over the energy force Xavier had felt before.  With a few great ideas in mind the two eventually joined by Bruce began working together on analyzing all of the information gathered thus far.
Bucky looked back at him.
“It’s fine!” Bucky’s voice broke through Tony’s inner turmoil. It was clear, confident and… authoritative? “I can do it.” He declared resolutely.
“Come on, Tony. Let’s get cleaned up.”
"Sam can do it." Barnes countered.
Before he could fully melt into the sensation he lept up suddenly.
She frowned.
“Oh, this is rich, you really don’t know do you?” He sneered.
A lot had changed over time. It must have been well over 20 years since he was last here. Things do tend to change in that kind of time. There were new buildings here and there and even some missing, he noted. The same can also be said for varying businesses. As much as things had changed there were just as many things still the same. The ice cream shop was one of them.
Not over yet? Tony wanted to argue; the situation felt pretty desperate. However, the look on Steve’s face gave him pause and should he dare think, reason to hope?
Soon enough, they reached the end of the corridor door that led to portal B – 03.
Just as dawn was on the horizon, Jarvis alerted Tony on his phone.  Steve shook wake alert and ready for battle.  As soon as he realized what was happening he looked at Tony expectantly.  Tony sluggishly pulled his phone out and looked at the screen.
“See!” Clint shouted. “This is what I’m talking about! What the hell is going on!!?”
“Yeah?  ‘cause we didn’t have the best start.”  He laughed nervously.
Steve, the perfect tactician knew better, a full scale lock down was surly a bad idea.
A/N: Yes! Finally! Finally he gets sent back in time. For the longest time I seriously thought we were not going to get here. It is definitely something of a load off. Now all I have to do is play with this situation and at the same time show everybody what’s happening on the other side with Tony and the others, no pressure… I hope this was satisfying enough. This was actually going to end up being one of my shortest chapters ever but I felt it needed an extra scene. The extra scene was Steve’s flashback it fits well and it also will lead into various key points I have planned for later on.
“I had Jarvis search everything he could so that we may know that we’re dealing with the possibility of just one alien.  Since the cases were so random and so far away from each other at times I was afraid we might have been dealing with a few of them all working together.
Of course Johnny was one of the first to volunteer. Steve nodded in assent. In his head he thought this was most certainly going to be a very long day. He groaned on the inside.
“Hawkeye, I’m heading to the perimeter on the southeast side, I’ve got five kids with me.”
“Aww, please, daddy pleeeease?” She pleaded softly.
“Captain Rogers! I know you are leading this unit. You should face me like a man!” Dr. Doom called out.
Later that night, after successfully getting Ellie tucked in without a hitch, and reading her 'The Fox and the Grapes' from Aesop's fables, Steve went about the house and property trying to finish the chores he could before Peggy got home.
On the other side…
Tony continued and gently placed monitoring nodes at the soldiers temples, talking out each step.
“So, I looked hot before?” He smirked.
“Like I said, something stupid.” Steve replied sharply.
She started to drag him the opposite direction to her own quarters. The Captain, relatively pliant do to mortification, had no choice but to obey. By the time they made it to her room Steve gathered his wits enough to realize he needed to make an escape.
"I don't think I'm going to make it!" She exclaimed in distress.
The Crazy genius almost backed away from the beautiful intensity of Steve’s smile. Is it wrong to admit how horribly turned on the billionaire is right now?  Probably. ‘Hmmm…I wonder how he would react if I told him so.’ Tony thought mischievously. Well as they say curiosity killed the cat, good thing Tony is not a cat.
“It’s okay Stevie, it’s okay.” Bucky said through Snickers while trying to pat his shoulders.
Steve gaped at them.
Don't forget to leave me a review and let me know what you think.
“Captain America!!” They exclaimed.
In seconds he was in front of Steve looking him over.
Steve was thankful for the distraction that Peter presented. He did not know how he was going to handle Tony after that. He relaxed a bit more when he realized that Rhodey now held Tony’s attention. The Colonel lead Tony away to the bar where they began a deep conversation with Pepper and Happy.
Johnny chuckled.
He seriously could not wait till this was all over and he could remember again. This was just getting ridiculous.
“An uncivilized one!” Tony retorted with benign venom. Bucky watched him queerly. “Never mind. Just hang tight while I try another variation and set up some programs. You’re welcome to as much coffee as you want, just don’t drink straight from the pot.” Tony warned almost wild eyed.
“My Dear Captain, I had hoped you would address me again.” She smiled and came back to stand behind Steve once more. She also ran her fingers down his cheek, tracing his jaw.
‘Oh God, not now! Why now?’ He thought in misery.
Yes! Iron armor. Artificial heart, iron armor, this mysterious man… Iron M-
“Uh huh, sure.” Bucky drawled. Steve was fooling no one. “Or, how about the countless times you picked a fight with someone three times bigger than you?”
The man stopped in front of him and glared. There was a small red mark on his shoulder. Well, we made him bleed. Just as he was about to reengage the fast man Thor landed behind him.
“Most certainly Captain.” Charles replied.
Tony shook his head. "Like I said, the hole is going to destabilize and grow until it consumes everything. That's not all, if the hole gets any bigger that creature will be able to come all the way through." He replied gravely.
"Because..." He began, the cracks now started to show up over the little girl. He was alarmed to see one streak across her beautiful tear stained face.
"It's all right, dear, you didn't wake me." She said stifling a yawn. "It's about time I get up anyway."
He continued to stare down at the child. Oh, she was good. Definitely a force to reckon with. He swallowed thickly and took a deep breath. He chanted ‘don’t cave, don’t cave’ to himself over and over until he had the strength to finally look away.
“Yeah? That’s what you said last time but here I am.” Tony retorted still laughing.
“Oh... Yeah…” He squeaked out.
Steve grew stricken when he couldn’t detect a heartbeat. He began CPR. He did gentle but firm chest compressions and made sure to give small breaths her tiny lungs. Tears were streaming down his face now. He began to chant “Please don’t die.” over and over and over.
At the very least, he mused, he must of had that dance.
Steve only broke out into a wide grin. He knew she probably is the only person in the world that could take him down and likely knew each and every one of his weaknesses. But he couldn’t help it. She was so desperately beautiful, he’d expect nothing less from her fiery personality.
"Then what?!"
“No! Howard was my friend.”
“What the hell are you doing out of recovery, anyway?” Tony asked turning back to his work. But before Barnes could answer Tony’s eyes widened, focusing now on something across the room. “Dumm-E no! That way with those! That way!” He shouted at the poor bumbling robot, gesturing to a room to the left.
“No!” The Captain screamed.
Steve sighed, “Any way…” He continued.
“You’re Stupid! So fucking stupid!” Tony repeated in hysterics.
“Was that simply from the shock of her sudden appearance?” He asked.
Tony gave him his last warning in code. Clint knew it to mean ‘get the hell out, I’m going to blow skyhigh.’
Steve wondered idly what those were. Well if they had anything to do with the reason Tony was adamant on keeping him on house arrest, then he was going to punch that bastard in the face.
“Ah Hah! I knew it!” He gushed in triumph as he pulled out a military standard first aid kit. He opened it and began to remove the tools needed for stitches.
“How would that even be accomplished? There is no time to build a spaceship or even a series of spaceships for that kind of capacity. Regardless such a sentiment seems a bit much.”
Tony smiled despite himself. As he watched Bucky’s prickly obtuseness all of the new information he had gathered these last few hours became a raging storm of knowledge swirling around in a nightmarish typhoon inside his brain. The only way to stay afloat and not let his oppressive and pessimistic thoughts take over was to focus on Steve.
“Yeah?  Bet you look terrible in them.”  Tony ribbed.  Steve looked sideways at Tony thinking the same exact thing.
Tony leaned in again and pressed a firmer more tender kiss to his lips. Steve was in perfect anguish. How long had he wanted this? To have a tender moment alone with Tony without any interruptions? To finally kiss him freely? Here he was finally in this moment and it was despairingly tainted. He could not help himself though, he knew he would desperately regret it later but he began to kiss Tony back anyway. He still loved him regardless of every stupid thing that has happened so far. How can something hurt so much yet alternately feel so damn good at the same time?
‘I bet.’  Steve thought.
“Well if it is, see you all on the other side.” Tony grinned as he plugged the thumb drive into the tablet.
“Be strong Steve. Don’t fall for it.” He heard Peggy say beside him. She might as well have been 2000 light years away.
He could swear Dickie nearly swooned.
They were getting close to the point where Kevin can use the sonic pulse. Just a little further. Six of the zappers all of a sudden swarmed Steve and they got him in the chest and back before he could disable them.
“Oh! My dearest Steven this is most certainly a test!” She laughed.
“Oh come now, don’t stop on my account.”  Calamity chuckled from where she was standing, rifling through some of Steve’s paintings.
Bucky looked down at Steve once more. The Captain could see it in his eyes, the war had been settled as clarity blossomed over his features and his shaking stopped. The soldier rapidly took aim and fired.
Steve itched to aid her desperately. However, the black eye he sported for an hour or so yesterday gave him pause. He had to keep reminding himself that she was fully capable and that if she needed help she would let him know. Or, at least, that's what she kept telling him. He watched her move about carefully regardless, ready to spring into action the moment he detected any amount of unstable movement.
Tony groaned as he tapped his head against the control panel.
Fuck you, universe.
‘Great.’ Steve thought, ‘Now Tony’s drunk.’
“All right, Babydoll, go for it.”
He needed to feel more pain right?
Fuck You.
Fury was going to retort however Xavier started to chuckle.
"Great, a rogue helicarrier, perfect." He snarked.
"Well you deserve it."
"Time will tell, Anthony, time will tell." She smiled as she disappeared into nothingness.
“But, in doing so you created a grand beacon for me to follow and I can ignore it no longer.”  Her brow furrowed in dismay and her entire tone expressed ominous regret.
Why did every god damn person Tony cared about eventually leave!?
“There was a unanimous decision to put you under another house arrest, or your own safety. You just got one hell of a shock and all of us believe you are incapable of making rational decisions. You will be kept under constant surveillance and confined to your newly assigned living space until the time you are fit for duty.” Director Fury ordered officially.
Xavier spoke up, “Come.”  He gestured to the other members.  “Let’s give them a moment.”
“Any last minute objections?” Tony asked.
Calamity isn’t the only one causing trouble.
Tony sighed. “Yeah, probably.”
No one really reacted to that.  It kind of figured.
“Oh, thank God. You promise? As you know I’m starting to develop a thing about people ‘asking’ me to surrender.” He quipped. He smirked when he could visibly see their agitation grow.
"That's okay, Thor explained the basics to me once. I think I might get the gist of it."
“Mr. Stark and Captain Rogers come to my quarters now, it is urgent.”  The audio feed cut off suddenly.
Steve admonished himself or not thinking of that. Ellie must've dropped Princess Avalon in her sleep, she did not have her with her when he scooped her up. He thought of her shoes but not if she had her doll.
Tony huffed dramatically and turned away from Bucky. He grumbled to himself as he monitored the system access. Anytime now they could get booted from the system again.
"Imagine if you will a universe where every single living creature, every soul, understood one another. A universe where senseless murders and fruitless wars did not exist. A universe where the inhabitants shared resources instead of fought over them."
Steve looked upon the bot with dismay still coughing blood. He realized the bot was about to deliver a driving punch. He placed his shield between himself and the bot. The impact was like nothing he ever felt before, even with his vibranium shield that the Doom bot had successfully struck away from him.
He shook his head in an attempt to alleviate the strange hazy feeling that was wrapped around his mind. He knew without a shadow of a doubt he had forgotten something important again.
It seemed to tear its attention to the distance behind it. Then Tony heard what must have caught his attention.
“I’m sorry, Tony.” She sighed heavily. “I will try my hardest to get as much time as possible on my end. Just don’t give up, okay?” She said grabbing his hands and making him look her in the eye. “Please, just keep going.”
Steve desperately enjoyed spending his afternoons just like this, painting with his baby girl. Peggy too when she gets back. She always made the loveliest watercolor flowers.
“Calamity is the alien hell-bent on taking over the universe, right?” Bucky interceded suddenly.
"Who the hell are you?" Steve demanded cutting the man off.
The genius coughed and hiccuped as he desperately tried to pull it together. His constant consumption of coffee and alcohol combined with his desperate lack of sleep made the nightmares all the more hideous, and as time went on made them incomprehensibly worse. He was truly afraid he was going to lose it, that he
He heard her pad away and let out a breath of relief when he heard their bedroom door shut. He did not mean to be so harsh with her but he was absolutely mortified with himself.
“So, what did you think about Maria?” Steve asked casually.
She began to fade and become almost translucent like an apparition.
“Some of my best memories of Bucky are there.” He said as he willed himself not to tear up.
“Steve, please… You’ll break… His heart.” She huffed disoriented.
“Always, Boss.”
Tony whipped around to look at the hole. The mother was still wailing and squirming as she tried desperately to claw her way out. A few hundred more chrysalis came through and as he stared at the pseudo-void for a time, he was able to discern that the hole had in fact stopped closing and even more distressing, he realized, it was also ever so slightly opening back up again.
Steve may have been good at fooling other people there was no fooling James Buchanan Barnes. Bucky can see it clear as day in his pale blue eyes. Steve was scared.
He didn’t need him to finish that sentiment. Tony knew what he was talking about. If only he had pulled his head out of his ass long enough. In the end Tony didn’t risk his heart. Not really. He could make excuse after excuse as to why he put it off. But in the end he was still too much of a coward.
"So, what's gonna happen now? You don't have the people of Earth or Midgard should I say, so are you just going to go on to the next planet?"
End of discussion. No one was hurt, thank God (Thor).
“I am.” He admitted. There was absolutely no sense in denying it.
He ignored the beautiful visage in front of him the best he could.
“Did they do it?”  Johnny asked astonished.  Steve was about to reply that he hopes so before a great surge of energy exploded into the sky in a straight column.
Steve nodded in affirmation.
“That’s fantastic.” Tony growled sarcastically.
Now Harker looked really scared. He turned around and started to run. He was this fat pink waddling mess and Steve could not help but to think how immensely humorous it was if he wasn’t so God damn angry.
‘Great.’  He thought.
The display disappeared and the lights came on.
Tony gave Steve a sexy smirk before licking his lips and leaned forward at what seemed like an agonizingly slow pace. Tony gave the Captain a teasing wink before taking Steve's hard twitching cock in hand, giving it a few firm strokes evoking the most delicious sounds from Steve's lips. With the smirk still pulling on his lips Tony opened his mouth and-
“Again, proper channels.” Fury drawled.
Steve opened the door quickly and pushed a discreet button on the ball and rolled it into the kitchen. He shut the door promptly. Just that quick glance told him that there were swarms of the fuzz balls in the house.
"Okay!"
All comments, questions, and theories welcome.
“Hello, Professor Xavier. We spoke via video phone.” Bruce introduced himself and offered his hand to the Professor.
"May I know what his test was?" Steve asked, now he was thoroughly intrigued.
"I've had Jarvis working on it since the sta-"
His first thought was if he could somehow kill himself it might stop her. He laughed at the thought however. She would probably find a way to stop him or revive him. Besides there was no telling if she would just choose someone else if he did manage to off himself. He would absolutely not put that burden on anyone else.
“Stark, I do hope that whatever you are doing on your phone is important.” Fury drawled out, everyone ignored him focusing on Tony.
'Ellie needs me!'
Steve subtly shook his head in denial. ‘No please no.’
She chuckled darkly then looked up at Steve with a sad smile, "No, not anymore."
Tony twirled a way and waved the wand over the soldiers unguarded ribs to see what would happen, Barnes yelped and tried to shield his ribs the best he could with one arm.
“Our team.”  Tony clarified as he was rapidly going through information on his phone.  “Jarvis says everyone is still in good health.”
Steve took that time to gaze around the shop in an attempt to gauge what kind of gift Peggy may have ordered for Howard and Maria. Unfortunately, what he saw was that the shop contained a little bit of everything a newlywed couple could ever want or need.
Tony bristled. "Of course, I should!" Was his immediate response.
Suddenly, much to his surprise, the odd mysterious suit of armor flashed into his mind. It was the most gorgeous hue of red, he felt. It had just the right touches of gold and felt somehow like something Royal, not so much flashy, not entirely, but something more grand and powerful with an adamant statement. A proclamation of sorts.
“We had a mission a few days ago. It went sideways and we- I- barely made it out of there alive. If it wasn’t for those kids showing up… The world would have been doomed one way or another. And I can’t…” He broke off suddenly as he choked back a sob. All the emotions he had fiercely attempted to smother the last few days had come stampeding back with a vengeance.
“I have a knack for doing that.”  Steve remarked with a smirk despite himself.
“Good. Let me know at once if it gets to numb for you.” Tony instructed. The soldier only nodded.
He felt it before anything. Someone came up on him rapidly and made to trip him. He thrusted his shield out as fast as he could. He wanted to grin in triumph, he had just barely managed to nick the guy. He realized then that the man wasn’t invisible, he was fast.
“Given the information that you have compiled, Tony, I have no doubts now that SHIELD will intervene at some point soon. Which means we should prepare for the inevitable.”
“You’re on! Fifty says he’s totally plastered!”
There were a few more odd ended things stored along the left side and storage containers in the rafters.
Steve was on his way to the meeting room. Tony told him that he’d meet him on the way. Finally they were going to pool their minds and resources together to figure out a plan to fix the situation. They needed to figure out some sort of cure for the victims or the identity of the mysterious foe along with how to defeat it. He couldn’t bear it if any more people got hurt not to mention his own team mates. They were his family. He’d hate himself forever if he could not protect one of his friends...like before…
Because A: it wasn't his call to make and B: …
“There!”
All because of Steve Rogers, the man out of time. At only the very sound of his voice and his adamant resolve he was able to restore faith.
"Syncing complete in five-"
"I just can't sit here and watch, please there's gotta be a way."
“The folders that are going around contain all of the patients’ records medical and supplementary in every minuscule detail possible. Somewhere in these documents, there is a connection that links everything together. It is all of our jobs to find it.”
Please leave a review and let me know what you all think of this mess so far.
He was at Steve’s side in moments, checking him over while reassuring him.
“Earth’s mightiest heroes.” He said earning wry amusement from varying Avengers.
“There will be more outside the door. Stay behind me.”
He could see how Bucky’s demeanor had changed. When moments ago he was cocky and defiant, now he could see how frightened he truly was. The trauma and terror was bone deep. Tony could visibly see his composure crack. It was utterly revolting. Yet, despite knowing what the contents of the journal has in store for him he refused to talk. Of course, he wouldn’t say anything. He viewed Tony as the enemy and the reason for his capture and imprisonment. Tony was the guy that hurt his best friend. He was completely loyal to the bitter end.
“Tell me how many points I have now and I promise I’ll stop.” Tony demanded smugly.
“Me out of the way, obviously.  But why?  That’s the real question.”
There was no time!
“There’s a different program that is connected to your restraints that Jarvis hasn’t infiltrated yet. If it senses the removal of your restraints without the authorization code the alarm will sound.” Tony replied as he continued to examine the stats.
“Lang? You up for the challenge?”
I apologize for any and all errors.
“Sir, Miss Romanov is at the door looking for Captain Rogers, shall I let her in?”
Tony also supposed he would come up with a few designs utilizing the shifting plate technology Hydra employed. But, of course, with a few tweaks of his own. It really was a genius idea and it definitely increased strength and mobility without losing too much durability.
Married with a child.
The realization shot through his body like electricity.
He was working on another painting of the odd futuristic armor that had been plaguing his dreams. He was utilizing his art studio in the barn and had begun making significant headway in replacing the stale work he had before. The strange suit of armor had quickly become one of his favorite subjects. He worked on his paintings and drawings to give himself something to do while Ellie was at school and Peggy out with Angie.
When she rounded the corner out of sight, his smile fell into a grimace.
“How do we get out now? We’re under water.” Bucky observed.
“You can’t do it alone Tony!”  Steve shouted.
I apologize for any and all errors.
“T-there’s a c-condition though.”  He whispered, not willing to meet anybody’s gaze.
He’ll figure it out eventually.
What if he can decipher what he was thinking for even planning? He figured out how to read his eyes like Bucky did.
He dug his knees into the earth, adamantly trying to avoid getting sucked in.
“I went as far to listen to all of the folk tales of old.” He paused.
He was thinking about the extent of the abilities of their foe. To be able to put people in those types of comas, did it take extreme effort or was it as simple as breathing? There was no way to know for sure until more information surfaced or until they met the thing face to face. At the very least they are getting closer to figuring out what ever this is.
It was also created by a machine that Tony had only seen the rough schematics of once before and by the genius's estimation the machine he saw was still in its early developmental stages.
“We… Can’t.” He groaned. Steve looked almost pained.
“Wait, hey! Who’s to say I’m even gonna be remotely lucid tomorrow? It’s taking everything I have just to keep it together now, what if I don’t even want to participate in your little experiment anymore?” The soldier pointed out sharply, almost angrily.
“You know I can’t do that Bucky.”
“Wow, seven colors!? What were they?” He asked astonished as he began cracking eggs.
Steve smiled knowingly at Tony who now had his back turned to the captain.  With a warm feeling building his chest he absently started to sketch a scene almost long forgotten.
“Yeah well, I somehow have found myself in this really stupid situation and I need information.”
Steve grinned at her term of endearment for him and Ellie. "I promise we will behave." He reassured.
“Boss!  Boss!  I found a translator!”  The slender figure said dragging a frightened man behind him.
Steve decided then and there, that if they all make it somehow against all odds, he was definitely taking Tony up on that vacation offer. Seriously, the genius wouldn’t have to bribe him or trick him. Nope he’d be ready with bells on.
“Hmm, just a little over three hours.” The Captain relaxed a little.
“Yeah, I wasn’t expecting it either, I was pretty adamant in my decision last night.” He replied.
He found a way into the second factory by a broken out window on the ground floor.  He quickly found the place non-operational.  So that means no elevators.  He had to take the stairs. He looked up the staircase and experienced that odd phenomenon where the stairs seemed to keep going on and on, forever growing.
On the other side~
His wrist burned as if it was on fire.
They looked at each other for a moment before Tony had to break the mood.
Steve and Ellie looked up at the same time and grinned at each other.
But what about the siblings?
“You’re damn right! And don’t you ever forget it!” She winked.
"Yeah, well you don't exactly have a choice either." Black Widow piped up suddenly. "Looks like it's growing."
“No.” Was his resounding reply.
"Jesus Christ!" He shouted to himself as he turned on the tap and splashed his face with cold water. "Oh God, oh God." He muttered in a mantra when he realized that he was still painfully hard.
He looked down again. Aaaand that was a huge, massive mistake. Somehow, she had intensified the look. How did she do that??
No! Bucky wouldn’t! Unless he was made to forget again… No! He could see it; he was becoming himself again.
So in time Steve had been forced to learn more natural methods of taking care of things like headaches and muscle aches and such.  Meditation and aromatherapy were not even going to cut it this time, however.  Steve was this close to finding himself a pharmacy and consuming everything on site.
Tony beamed.
Barnes nodded, still haphazardly rummaging through folders.
“How, are you feeling? We’ve nearly reached the plateau point.” Tony asked getting back on task.
"Ellie…" He said slowly and warningly. "How many dolls do you have at home?" He asked critically, thinking about the Army of dolls on her shelves. There had to be at least seventy of them.
Jesus Christ, Tony was terrified, he just wanted to scream and run impossibly wet himself a little. The terror must have shown on his face because the stare relented and the bastard had the audacity to smirk at him.
Steve ended up recruiting Sam Wilson, a talented soldier from a para-rescue unit, code name Falcon. Through Sam they ended up recruiting an electrical engineer with a record. Scott Lang apparently was in possession of unregistered Pym-Tech technology with fascinating capabilities with the code name Ant-Man.
“Can’t IronMan fly us out of here?” Tommy asked shyly.
‘Great…  I really did not think that went through.’  He thought regretfully.
On the other side~
‘No!’ Tony pleaded with himself. ‘It’s not going to end here! I won’t allow it! I just got Steve back; I’m not going to lose him again!’
This person before him, the way he stands, the way he moves, even the small snippets of his voice were all familiar to him. He had felt that before when they first fought and he got a glimpse of those haunting blue eyes and again just now. They were devastatingly familiar eyes. Eyes he could not forget in a million years…
“I’ll initiate that protocol then.”  Tony replied quickly. I’ll let you know what’s happening after.
'It can't be…"
Steve sighed in relief despite the overwhelming fucked up situation and the fact he was pretty much dying right now.
"Can you just turn them off?" Barton suggested.
"Daddy, what's wrong?" She looked up at him with those beautiful eyes.
“Steve, what happened was in no way your fault.” He assured adamantly.
“So there is something.  What is it!?”  Steve was getting angrier now.
During the operation Barnes nearly had a breakdown. It was one thing to remove hardware that caused his pain and torment for years. It was another to have new, similar hardware installed. Like Tony warned, the procedure was excruciating. You’d think the most painful part was mounting the bone anchors as they needed to drill deep into the bone for the insertion mechanism and anchor screws. Because, he had the painkilling device that Tony created, that part will was a piece of cake for Barnes in comparison to the installation of the neuro-clasps. Each clasp needed to be attached to an existing nerve then tested.
His world came crashing down again.
Steve woke up with a feeling of all consuming numbness.  It took him a while to realize that he was in fact awake and…  Well…  Alive for that matter.  He looked no better either.  He had prominent dark circles under his eyes and his face was a little sunken in.  He spaced out watching his heartbeat on the monitor.
Tony went red in the face realizing now that Barnes was going through his Amazon order history. The genius snapped out of his mortification when Wanda slapped her hands over her face desperately trying not to laugh out loud.
Calamity’s response was to laugh out loud.
The room became eerily quiet.  Everyone slowly looked at Tony for confirmation.  The genius had placed his hands over his face and began to sob.
But before Steve could answer an alarming squeal sounded off.
He let go of her wrist reluctantly. She reached for Tony again. Tony stiffened, his posture as hard as iron.
“Hey, look at me.” The genius grabbed his face tenderly and made Steve look him in the eye.
Steve sat down and grabbed her hand and quickly gave thanks to the Lord. The moment he ended the prayer she ate that forkful delightfully.
In all honesty, Fury wanted to stop them and keep them on the helicarrier to continue working.  But they were neither his agents nor his employees.  They were just his honored guests and invaluable consultants.  Therefore at this point in time he had no right to keep them.
On the other side~
“Here,” she said as she produced a thumb drive out of a pocket of her jeans.
“Did just what happened is what I think just what happened?” Barton asked over the coms.
Steve could feel the rage and desperation rolling off of Tony in waves. He licked his dry chapped lips and tried to make amends.
“What about us?” Maggie asked in a whisper.
She smiled sadly as she patted his cheek fondly. She walked away to join her brother. Steve watched her go absently. He watched as she smoothed over a growing disagreement between Bucky and Pietro. He grinned briefly before turning his attention to his sketchbook. He had a few blank pages left, just enough for a letter. He went over Wanda’s words to him again.
'How on earth could Tony consume it like this and still call it glorious liquid heaven?' He mused for a moment then froze.
"I am fully aware of that, love." She said regretfully. "It is one of the reasons why I chose you." She admitted.
Bucky sighed, "That little punk would probably say something so ridiculously noble like 'I can't think of anyone worthier.'"
The heart!
Chapter Five: When the Levee Breaks
He took a shuttering breath, "This was why it was so difficult to figure out your code. Why there were large quantities of code I could not hope to read."
“Finally got your Pa out of that old barn did you?” She winked.
Tony noticed his gaze and bristled, “What? Do I have a pimple or something?”
Steve watched with bated breath as Hank finished up that conversation on the phone.  He felt absolutely wretched.  That school was full of kids, children for god’s sake.  How many were taken down?  He didn’t know.
"We better- find someplace more- comfortable, before we show the world- what we're made of." He suggested with a mischievous glint in his eye.
Bucky stared wide-eyed expectantly he shook his head ever so slightly.
Bucky turned and looked up at Tony with wide innocent eyes. “Taking advantage of my full, unrestricted access to all your personal shit.” He replied, his innocent façade never wavering.
He had also used the opportunity a computer yielded to reconnect with Jarvis. The connection was tenuous as it predicated on weak and insubstantial Wi-Fi signals. There wasn't much he could have Jarvis do from here, however, he could find out about the new suit that was supposed to be coming his way.
“I don’t know I just started drawing and this is what came out.”  He retorted a little annoyed with Tony’s attitude about the subject. The crazy genius then walked off to fiddle with his phone.
“No! Nothing happen!” Steve was adamant.
He knew the man standing before him attacking him now with unrelenting fists. His demeanor however was no longer cold and calculating. It was now white-hot with fury. The soldier’s movements were now sloppy and disjointed. Something had cracked in him. This new behavior made Steve all the more alarmed.
"Yep!" She finally got out.
Steve scowled that his response.
He took a deep breath and continued to paint the mysterious red and gold flying suit of armor.
“Sorry I was just… Making sure Tony got to bed safely.” He said his face completely flushed.
“At least your tastes are better than Steve’s.” Tony commented then flinched.
Nearly a full day had passed and Tony had been locked in his workshop the entire time, mostly manufacturing the devices that would neutralize the hold Calamity has over the people.
Witnessing Captain America with such a raunchy attitude was wildly unsettling. The genius shuddered violently causing Barnes's scowl to deepen.
She sneered. "I will gladly return him if you give me permission to take every last soul on this planet, excluding yours and his, right here, right now. Not you nor anyone else is permitted to do a single thing to stop me. Deal?"
“Okay, here’s how we’re going to do it…”
“Admittedly my first world that I took was for something as petty as fury, but I discovered so much about myself, so much about my gifts given to me by our great mother and my true purpose. I regret handling the first so brutally but alas it is what it is… The way it should be.” She admitted with a far off look.
They all froze. Everyone was shocked at the sound of the voice. No one recognized it. It reverberated about the room with a hint of vast power.
The Captain flinched at the sound of her voice, completely oblivious to her presence… Oh yes he was definitely out of it. She smiled warmly at him and stood up.
“What!? No!”
"Oh? Me trying to claim all the living souls on your planet wasn't exhilarating enough for you? How do people normally meet within your race?"
“What you mean Tony?” Asked Steve.
Bucky’s resurging love of music was the final nail in the coffin that was Hydra’s hold over him. Days ago, he had told Tony how much he loved music but had somehow completely forgotten. Tony took it upon himself to introduce Barnes to modern music, which included all his favorite rock and roll tracks. Branching out from there it really was no surprise that the soldier had taken a profound interest in various punk and metal bands. Genres like those tended to generally use darker themes, touching on war, murder, suicide, and an overall unjust world. Those particular themes resonated deeply with Bucky, as one can imagine. And despite everything, Barnes’s original love for jazz, and swing, in particular, had not diminished in the slightest, if anything, he appreciated them more.
“Well, there was a bit more that went into it. But essentially, yes.” Tony replied. “As much as I hate to admit it, Hydra did most of the hard work. I just took what they had and perfected it.” Tony added egotistically.
As soon as the bomb launched Bucky suddenly lurched into its path. He knocked it just right to send it on a new trajectory to the second unit sub. It detonated and sent the sub spiraling away. Tony cheered as he made the rest of the distance. Sub number one was about to retaliate when an actual explosive detonated near the little unit and sent it careening sharply.
What is and what should never be."
“Okay, I know I don’t have much time left but I’m going to use what I can of it to make sure you guys are safe.”
He sighed then pointed at Barnes. “You, get back to your seat so we can get this over with.”
"Oh. That time." He thought remorsefully. "I just wish I could see my friends and Tony one last time. I wanted to let him know that I never stopped loving him and to at the very least say goodbye."
“Not without getting at least a little bit to eat, you haven’t eaten anything all day I’m pretty damn sure.”  Steve said as he pulled Tony up to stand.
“You mean, like picking up a spatula, holding it tight and using it to flip over my breakfast?” Barnes asked with a rueful triumphant smirk.
"Two-"
“Come on let’s make these pies to die for!”  Steve smiled wickedly.
Tony nodded solemnly, for once at a loss for words, which only served to make Fury a thousand times more uncomfortable with the situation.
“Haven’t lost them all yet.” Fury replied from the doorway.
End Chapter Twenty.
“Is there anything else I can do for you?”  He asked looking between the two.
There is a part of me that still hates you. And that’s exactly what makes me crazy about you. I love how much I hate you. I love how angry you make me. I love how complicated you are. How you keep me on my toes, I never know what to expect out of you. You are such an infuriating puzzle. A puzzle in which I am desperate to solve.
He got the point quick enough and bailed. Tony’s weapons missed, thank God, but now he was aiming for Rhodey and Sam! They don’t have their weapons or armor on, they are sitting ducks.
Everything else had actually been going spectacularly well the last week or so. He had solved the puzzle and completed Calamity's code. Using that information, he had successfully repurposed his BARF device and had looked into the minds of some of her victims that he had access to. Realizing that the victims were playing out some sort of perfect fantasy in a dreamscape mind reality, curiosity had of course eventually consumed him.
Tony took an angry swig of his drink before chucking it across the room. He got little satisfaction watching it shatter on the wall opposite him. He sighed heavily as he ran his hands through his hair. This was just so stupid! He groaned audibly as he began to repeatedly bang his head on the table. Fuck you universe, fuck you.
Tony rolled his eyes internally, ‘Of course Nat can get through to him.’ He thought almost bitterly.
Tony sighed heavily. That was the whole god damn purpose of this entire fiasco. The very thing Tony spent the last two days trying to figure out.
End Chapter Twenty-Six
Barnes turned and gave Tony that bone chilling stare. Though the genius was still unnerved by that stare, it surprised Tony that he no longer felt the crippling fear he once did. How odd that he no longer felt Barnes was a threat to his life, not in the least. They really have come a long way.
“Why didn’t you tell me sooner? After we found out Calamity would take me for sure, why did I have to hear it Johnny?”
“Why?”  He uttered despondently looking into Xavier’s stricken face.  Steve’s eyes were a sorrowful blue.
Steve stood with all of the children still latched on to him to greet the parents.  The children were delighted.  He held out his hand best he could before they all had bypassed his hand and tearfully joined their children in hugging Captain America.
It’s only Steve now.
Steve hated this with every fiber of his being. Of course, he remembered her. He remembered everything about her with disdainful clarity. He remembered the time he spent with her, teaching her, learning from her, loving her. All that does not change the fact that he knew what Calamity was up to. He knew that the beautiful visage before him was either a very convincing figment of his imagination or a sinister specter conjured by Calamity herself. Either way, all this wasn't real.
She stared at him incredulously.
Steve was unable to resist, his body obeyed her dutifully. The others watched in frozen terror unable to comprehend what was happening. They can see the tense look on Steve’s face.
“Fitting isn’t it?” He said with unconcealed bite.
Clint looked upon Tony with sympathy.
All questions, comments, and theories welcome.
He liked the idea of Tony eating something he made. He wasn’t even going to stop his treacherous domestic thoughts, white flag remember.
At the very least this was going to be entertaining.
Oh yeah.
Tony isn't coping well with the backlash of the last mission.  However, he finds hope in the unlikeliest place.
Bucky looked at him like he had been struck. He hated having Steve twist it back at him.
“You didn’t give the letter to your team yet?” Bucky asked incredulously.
Barnes nodded. “It’s funny how close Hydra was to being right regarding everything they dug up about the Nordic lore.” He mused. “Personally, I always thought they were all bat crap crazy, at least when I was free to think so for myself.”
“How does keeping the fact that I am the keystone from me keep me alive!? Hmm? She’s going to claim me one way or another!” Steve argued.
“Whatever happens, I’m with you pal, till the end of the line.” He whispered into Steve’s shoulder.
Barnes flipped him off and Natasha shook her head and ran her hands over her eyes in exasperation.
Steve smiled sadly one last time at his sketch and turned back to his letter and began writing once more. If today was really the end, then he was going to send all his love to him. He was going to let that beautiful man know how much his existence impacted his life and how much he really meant to him. He hoped that of all the time they spent together he had a positive impact on Tony’s life to.
He noted that Angie was no longer next to them.
Saving everyone from Calamity was a priority. He had tried a few more algorithms earlier that day. They all failed spectacularly. To be honest he had somewhat given up on trying to decipher the data load Calamity gave to him and had gone back to writing the desynthization program from scratch. The simulations were as detestable as ever. He really did not know what he was going to do if he couldn’t solve the code or create one to free people from their comas, to release Calamity’s hold over them.
Why is he reacting this way? It’s like watching Bucky fall all over again but somehow worse!
“Shit.” He muttered. “Is he lucid?” Tony asked apprehensive. Maybe if he was having an episode Tony could just leave him alone.
“Oh, are you alive again?” Steve glared at him.
The only reprieve Tony got was the fact that Jarvis was able to alert him that a small number of his team were in fact waking up from Calamity's coma. Unfortunately, he had no time to celebrate as the five-minute warning had come immediately after. No point enjoying his team's awakening if there was no world for his team to wake up to.
A/N: Holy crap! This chapter was by far the most difficult chapter I ever had to write. No, not because it was emotionally draining or anything, but because it was such a hot mess. It was just all over the place, it's like I vomited up Half Baked ideas all over 30 college-ruled notebook pages. Then I sprinkled in some incredibly awkward dialogue that didn't transition well, not to mention the entire three pages of content I left out of the final draft because it got way too damn political.
They had seconds at the most because he was coming in fast and hot. The Captain turned swiftly to the twins.
Barnes took a shaky breath, “I’ll definitely try.”
"You were here about," Steve looked at his watch. "Ten hours ago."
“Thank you, Jarvis.” The genius turned to the soldier. “You heard him, let’s get a move on.”
He couldn’t help recall that the last time he ate a real, full proper meal was when he was on his outing/ date with Tony. He sighed in defeat, dropping his head heavily on to the cool surface of the table. The resounding thud was almost shocking.
The front door shut.
Steve savored the times he could hold Tony’s gaze like this.  He was usually so guarded he never held eye contact for long.  Steve soaked up what he could greedily.  Tony’s wide chocolate eyes were always so expressive.  The Captain could see so much in them.  He could see how deep Tony’s complexity ran.  It is truly no wonder why no one has any idea who Tony Stark really is.  Just yet another reason why he loves this truly infuriating person in his arms so much.
*~0~*
"It’s nothing. I was just standing in the wrong place at the wrong time when this crazy Alien came in and viciously exploded a Doom bot with enough power to take out a leviathan! Bits of Doom bot went flying everywhere even managing to hit me in the head!” Clint recited with slight irritation, staring pointedly at Thor.
“Then it's settled. Steve trusted you. Went to stupidly insane lengths to make sure you were okay, to make sure you were safe. He’s rarely wrong right? Come on, if Steve, Captain fucking America says you’re good, you’re good.”
"I'm glad you came. I have the biggest favor to ask you." He began, his voice was tight with severity. "It's a catastrophe out there, people are dead and half the city, and world for that matter, is in ruins." Tony stated with an air of exhaustion and gravity. "When I broke you out of the Raft I did it because your skills and your loyalty to Steve would have been invaluable to us, to me. I needed somebody who could lead and rally our team in my stead so that I could focus on the code. You have been the biggest help to me, leading my team and keeping them safe these last couple of weeks." Tony acknowledged stiffly.
He nodded to Wanda to indicate that she should be on alert from here on in. It did not escape Tony’s notice how the soldier stiffened seemingly to physically brace himself. The moment Tony did turn the device on, however, Bucky went ramrod straight. After a moment, he relaxed and began to fiddle with the screen again.
“Torch, do you read me?”
A/N: And here I am back again! Ready for the next chapter of our wonderful adventure. Don’t forget to leave a review at the end of the chapter and I do apologize for any and all errors. Without any further ado, on with the show!
“That sounds about right. If it was terrestrial it would follow terrestrial norms.” Tony then focused his attention in Xavier.
This wasn’t like the compound. Avengers tower was infinitely more secure because this was where Tony housed a lot of his developing projects. Not just anyone could walk or hack their way through here. This was Tony’s domain; he’d have to get extra crafty if he wanted to find a way out of there. Tony even revoked all of Steve’s clearances and overrides.
None were happy.  Clint, still with a bandaged head, and Natasha were sitting next to each other. They appeared to be absorbing the comfort of being so near one another.
“Oh my God Steve, this is beautiful.” He said slowly lowering the book to look at his friend. “I knew you were mad for this guy but this is…” He trailed off overwhelmed. He got off the Steve quickly helping him up. “Come on we gotta find a way to get these mailed off proper.” He stated with a wink.
“Rhodey, move!” Tony bellowed.
~-0-~
Tony rolled his eyes. It was nearly impossible to take this guy seriously dress like a fucking bunny rabbit. If it wasn’t for the dead civilians and the strange technology he held, he’d write off the guy completely.
That man was Tony Stark, Howard Stark's son. Which explains why he's capable of such fascinating ingenuity. That's why it was so earth shattering to hear Peggy say that Howard couldn't have children. It was because of Tony and whatever his relationship is or was with him.
Bucky pulled closer to Steve and whispered, “It’s happening now isn’t it?”
“That’s Harker! Jarvis just confirmed it.” Tony alerted them.
As Tony walked off to do god knows what, Steve was running all of the collective information is his head. Even though he feels better knowing he has a slight grip on the situation, the whole thing is still scary as hell. The Captain started to think in terms of odds, how likely it would be for them to win.
Everyone stood in an awkward silence for a moment before the King addressed Heimdall.
Steve rested on the ground for a moment taking stock of his injuries. His right arm was fractured, he was sure at least three ribs were broken and two others cracked. His left leg was pretty sore and likely sported a miner fracture as well. He’d have to be mindful on how to move until they healed. He began to watch the battle between the Doom Bot and his team mates.
“He’d come for me!” He nearly shouted. “But how would he find me? How would I find him? It’s not like they can walk up to the tower and ask for me. It’s probably all over the news that I had abandoned ship anyway.”
It stirred up a feeling deep inside Steve that he couldn’t quite describe.  Tony gripped the captain’s shoulder and gave it a firm squeeze, then continued, “I mean it. We gotta keep our heads on straight for this.” He ended with a smirk.
He chuckled bitterly to himself. Oh boy, does he have a whole truck load of things he wants to say to Tony Stark. He seethed for a moment, thinking of all the nasty and venomous insults he wanted to throw at him.
“Mr. Stark will not be happy to find out you removed your restraints.”
"Steven, my love, this is a real fine family you have here, you know that do you not?" She admitted with reverence.
“Choose!” Calamity shouted, her eyes honing in on Iron Man in the distance.
The rift pulsated and fluctuated as it became unstable. The mother screamed in glee as the hole began to dilate. Tony began to feel the pull of the pseudo-void as it had begun to grow once more.
“Good night Tony.” He replied tensely.
This gave Tony pause again. He had to forcibly stop himself from barking out a yes. He hated himself in nearly falling for it. It was practically the same deal dressed up. Both deals ended the same way, she wins and gets all or most souls on earth. Then it truly dawned on him, if he bargained his soul now, everyone was going to die, he was the only person in the world that could decipher the code and use it to stop her. Who was he to even think about bargaining with the lives of innocent people?
Steve’s scowl morphed into a pout.
It was all Tony could do to stave off the panic.
Steve could feel his ribs fracture all over again at the pressure. A new wave of agony and hysteria overcoming him. He continued to watch his brother battle his pursuers unable to do anything to help him. His heart was an absolute anguish.
"The souls." She answered. "If you recall, I stated that Yggdrasil is existence itself. Imagine if you will, the universe as one living entity. Each and every one of us is a part of this one entity. It makes little sense to hurt others as we would only be hurting ourselves."
"Which model?" Tony asked in apprehension.
The Avengers all stood stock still has her laughter died down. No one dared to move.
“Five, you have been to one world in five different realms.” Thor stated slowly a realization dawning.
“Excuse me?” Steve was thrown through a loop, he was expecting Tony to utter something far more explicit.
“Like a knight?”
“I agree with him, Steve. If you already know the crazy lady set this up, you should avoid it.” Scott said tapping his ear.
He quickly scooped Ellie up, blankets and all and even had enough foresight to grab her shoes. He went to the bedroom and grabbed the travel case that Peggy had prepared for this purpose.
"It's okay, Babydoll. Mommy is having the baby." He said as calmly as he possibly could even though all he wanted to do was scream. He did not know how it was possible to feel so scared and excited and anxious all at once.
“No, not without you.” He uttered barely above a whisper.
“Please, if I can help anywhere else? I can’t just sit around and wait for something to happen.” Steve pleaded.
Tony was fiddling with the thumb drive in his hand. He was debating with himself what he should do with it. Steve was absent mindedly watching him.
Iron Man sank to his knees, Steve's limp body heavy in his arms.
“Jackass, it’s because Barnes is Sasha.”
Fuck!
Tony had to up his game.
He showed her the hope of a future with Peggy Carter and his exhilaration of having his best friend fight by his side. He showed her what it felt like having his heart ripped out as he watched helplessly as Bucky fell to his death. He made sure to leave not a single detail out. He showed her what it was like when he made the decision to make the ultimate sacrifice. How he was ready to give everything to ensure millions could live in his place when he brought the Valkyrie down.
“Why, if it isn’t my precious Jellybean.” She set the sundae down and pinched Ellie’s cheek. Ellie giggled.
Hours turned to days and the number of victims has grown exponentially. The number is deep into the hundreds and the media is in a frenzy. Tony had made little progress in his desinthysisaion simulations. At the very least the simulated patience aren’t blowing up, imploding or turning into goo anymore, that’s something at least.
At this point, Tony was not surprised that the Rhododendron had somehow came upon that conclusion, but he was extremely annoyed that despite the Rhododendron's apparent vast knowledge the fucker couldn't seem to figure out that it was Barnes that killed Harker, not Steve.
“Anthony, come here darling.” She said gently in sing song voice.
“Yeah, and you started bleeding and threw up on his dog?” He laughed at the memory. “Thought you were going to pass out.”
Steve moved to go look outside the window. He stared at the sky and the clouds and wondered when it was all going to end.
“And make sure med bay meets us with a gurney. We are taking no chances with this one.”
“Yes?”  He flashed Steve a grin trying to distract him from his discomfort.
There are plenty of villains out there still creating chaos.
“Wonderful.”
Calamity’s response to that was to run her hands along Steve’s clavicle and down his strong chest. Tony’s ire did not go unnoticed by anyone.
“Hey, you did too!”
I am so sorry that I have been gone so long! I really tried to come back sooner but life deeply enjoys throwing me those curveballs. Nevertheless, here I am.
“Come on you can trust me.” She said gently.
“I went back to the medical room…” He continued in despair.
“It’s a good look for you, dumbass.” A voice rang out from across the room.
“And the western cheeseburger for you.”  He stated as he set a plate in front of Steve.
"Daddy!"
Barnes and the Maximoff girl exchanged something of an exasperated look before quickly getting to their feet and following Tony out the door.
“You fucking idiot… w-we ain’t going to make it!” Bucky shouted.
“Not quite,” he guffawed. “But with this hair I can see how ya got confused.” He remarked as he flipped his hair dramatically.
"Who's nearest him?"
“Yes Sir” they replied in unison.
"So, your plan stops here?" He asked apprehensively. He was actually a little torn from that knowledge.
“Oh look! There’s a video!”
He struggled to rise off of the ground before the bot could deliver another attack. He was too late. The bot had adapted to be much quicker than the Captain and now securely has Steve’s neck in its death grip.  It rose its mechanical arm up slowly until Steve’s feet were barely dangling above the ground.
“He isn’t.” Pietro interjected. “You should have seen the shit storm he tried to create. We almost could not stop him.”
“Drop it!” He urged. “Let it go!” Steve commanded him.
“Scout’s honor.” Anything to end this.
He could sense that she was still concerned, however, and hoped that he could help alleviate her worry somewhat by eating what he could of his own meal even though he had lost his appetite some hours ago.
He gave it all to her. The good times and the bad times. He gave her his entire childhood, everything from losing his parents, dealing with his laundry list of illnesses to his profound bond with Bucky. He showed her what he went through joining the Army and the hell that was the serum infusion procedure and his rocky start as Captain America. He showed her the perdition that was the war Hydra created, and the terrifying face of that horrible organization, the Red Skull.
Now all he had to do was wait.
Little did they know people were watching them intently.
Voila! He was free.
“If only.”
“I made a deal, Tony.” He admitted.
“This troubles you?” Tony shot back with his snark.
“If you hated so much stop reading it!” Steve retorted trying to unpin himself and failing miserably.
Tony stiffened considerably at the sound of her voice.
Fuck! They needed to get out of the prison as soon as possible and get Bucky treated. Tony tried to think. He quickly took off his shirt leaving him in his under tank. He wadded up his T-shirt and pressed it to the wound the best he could and dug out duct tape out of his satchel and bound Bucky’s wound with his shirt and tape. After Tony was sure the makeshift binding would hold until he got back to the tower, he looked up to see Barnes staring queerly at his arc reactor. Bucky grabbed the edge of the tank at the top and pulled down, exposing it completely.
“Ha! So you were listening! Half the time I think I’m talking to myself.” The genius said ponderingly.
The look that Steve gave him made him feel like they all already have this thing won.
Barnes sighed heavily, then began his explanation in a low gravelly voice. “Hydra was built on the bastardized ideals of ancient civilizations spanning from the Mediterranean to Iceland. That includes the Nordic lore derived from ancient Asgardian settlements, what we know as Norse mythology.” He paused as he reached up and rubbed his left temple. “Johan Schmidt wanted to harness the power of the gods which led him to obsessively digging up everything he could about Yggdrasil and the whereabouts of the cube.”
He swiftly rolled to the left and used the momentum to fling himself up and simultaneously strike with his shield.  The soldier had anticipated his move and blocked the shield with his arm while at the same time punching Steve in the face with his right hand.  That one may not have been metal but it still felt like a battering ram.
“Jealous!? Yeah!” He practically squealed as he turned around to leave.
“Earlier I was showing Peter my paintings. I told him one of his photos inspired one and he wanted to see it.” Steve paused and took a deep breath.
He could hear their jagged intake of air as they prepared themselves for the inevitable. He could hear Bucky’s arm click and whir as he clenched and unclenched his fist in an effort to stay in control despite the overwhelming almost suffocating atmosphere. He could hear his own heartbeat speed up and slow down with every ragged breath he took, in every haggard fleeting thought.
“Good.”  Tony’s suited body began to approach him from behind.  Sensing a shift in the air Steve felt something was off.
“You know what? I’m done. You are so utterly useless! I don’t even know why we even tried.”
He nodded eagerly.
“Yep, But what you need to do right now is sleep.” Tony told Steve softly.
The moment the Captain felt the man's touch he flinched and backed away slowly. "Uh, yeah," Steve said in a rush, swallowing thickly. "I'm fine! I just, uh," He scrambled for something to say. "I just remembered something important. Uh, I gotta go." He said pointing behind him in the direction of his house.
“I had been trying to get your attention for nearly five minutes now. Stop being a baby.” She replied smoothly. “Well, I’ll get right to it. The Army isn’t going to break down your doors yet. But now they are going after the company. It’s only a matter of time Tony.”
Yes!  That’s right!
On the other side…
“You’re the most likely one!”
Oh boy, that did not sound good.
A/N: Welcome back my darling earthlings! I am so glad to finally get this to you.
End Chapter Twenty-Eight
After finishing up their dinner they headed their separate ways back to work. If they lingered in the hall a little too long reluctant to part of each other’s company, well, no one said a word. That, however, did not stop a select few from giving annoying knowing glances at Steve as he parked himself back in front of the monitor. The Captain had resolutely decided to ignore them anyway.
Darcy nodded vigorously in agreement.
“Don’t worry I will alert you immediately of any changes, I promise.”
He frowned in dismay, his desires didn’t matter anymore. He couldn’t open that door with Tony knowing the end was near. He could not do that to him.
'Bruce… my science bro… son of a bitch.' Tony thought in wild relief.
“Listen Steven, you know better than anyone that some secrets are best to be kept for the greater good.”  He told the Captain calmly.
“Thank you for telling me, really.” He whispered as he gave him a quick hug. “I… I need time to think.”
Soon enough a delicate calm had enveloped them as they sat there peacefully under that tree. The kids had fallen asleep shortly after, every one of them.
Their meal together was light and silent. They shared a few pieces of fruit and watched the stars twinkle in the sky from Tony’s assigned quarters. After they ate they retired to Tony’s bed together, neither of them wanting to be alone.
The man with the artificial heart? Artificial… Artificial… He has an artificial body too? No, not body, armor… Armor?
“Will do, Sir.”
No! He had to reach him.
It didn’t help that when Steve asked Fury and Natasha about the pinched looks on their faces they said it was nothing.
Steve nodded in affirmation. He was incredibly thankful to be of use even as a potential pack rat, but at the same time wholy concerned about traveling to a distinct galaxy to do so. It is truly incredible, the thought.
He opened the glass panel then stepped toe to toe with the suit and let it envelop him. He turned to Barnes, completely somber and serious.
Suddenly the quiet enveloped them and everything fell motionless, immediately casting a foreboding shadow. They stood stock still in the middle of the street waiting. Mercifully the roads were empty of civilians awesomely adding to the ominous dead silent atmosphere.
He wanted to scream. His very heart in soul was in a horrendous a desolation.
Soon enough they had completely consumed their meal joyfully.
He continued to punch them out once they got too close to their little group. Steve began to wonder why he felt the pain every time, why his hands weren’t going numb. He scoffed as the answer came to him.
Beep. Beep. Beep.
“Hmmm.” Was Thor’s reply as he continued to mull over the mass of new information.
"Was I?" He asked.
“No! Don’t do that to yourself. You could not have known. Look at me!” Bucky grabbed Steve’s space and looked him dead in the eye.
“Eleanor, naptime.” He repeated firmly. Yes! It was definitely for this time.
Tony sighed.
“If Tony hadn’t found you when he did… Not to mention your gut wound wasn’t as bad as it could have been. Talk about a near evisceration.”
They had compiled everything they have together. Everything they were working on the past few days were in folders, stacks of books, photocopies, and hard drives that were now, more or less, organized upon the surface of the table.
Fury was still unconscious and Bruce was cradling his head in his hands speaking softly to Natasha what sounded like a slew of apologies. She kept reassuring him that it wasn’t his fault. Clint was the only one remotely lively, pacing back and forth near the window of the common room they were currently occupying.
No pressure.
The splashes of red.
One minute.
'Princess Avalon.' Steve thought at the same time Ellie exclaimed,
“Thank you, Buck.” He took a shuddering breath trying to hold the tears back. “I don’t want to be alone in this.” Steve said as he held Bucky tighter.
The children nodded eagerly.
“Natalia…” He began. “She agrees with you.” He stated finally.
Now that letter, I had hoped to make is more poetic-esk? But I figured Steve is as emotionally constipated as I am so it’s still rather in character. I am so glad I had finally gotten to this point. I had been looking forward to revealing that Bucky was alive and Tony receiving Steve’s letter. Woot!
"Can you please, for once, trust me when I say it's in your best interest not to know what's going on?"
Chapter Three: Something Wicked
Steve breathed in deeply.
“We cannot run away or escape this. Fine. We shall stay and fight this thing, all of us to our last breath. We will do everything it takes to gather as much information as possible.” He paused making eye contact with each and every person in the room.
Tony looked at him exasperated. Really, he was not expecting Barnes to come around. At least not so soon. Now that he was here the genius did not know quite what to do with him. Sure, they needed to finish calibrating the painkilling device and eventually get a full body scan completed. Then they needed to talk about what their options were regarding replacing the soldiers arm. Unfortunately, there was much they needed to do to work up to that point. Diving right in is what kind of fucked everything up the last time.
“Graham!  Introduce them to the asset!  I have built the perfect team to combat the Avengers!”
Beep. Beep. Beep.
Howard can't have children.
Steve pressed his lips together. His face now rivaled the color of the tomato. He shook his head rapidly and turned on his heel intending to go back to his quarters.
“Tsk, I forgot that traitor takes your side.” Tony stated with a deep frown that morphed into a pout that the Captain could not help but to laugh at. In moments they were both laughing.
He had dreamt of it since day one and had marveled at its mechanics and ingenuity.
Steve nearly choked on his own tea at Darcy’s vulgar statement.
He sighed, allowing this affection to linger on a bit longer than he usually would.
“To think it’s digital complexity at its finest that which is the bane of Tony stark’s existence.” Natasha mused darkly.
“But how?  How would me knowing make me die?”  Steve looked at Charles apprehensively.  “If I knew would someone try to kill me?  Would I simply kill over? Would my head explode?  How?”  He tried to project his desperation through his thoughts, hoping the telepath would understand why he needed this.
'Good job Tony. Run your fucking mouth to a celestial God. Brilliant idea!' He chided himself.
“Mr. Stark what have you got?”  He stared at him with a look that screamed ‘Whatever you have got had better be good or I will murder you in front of everybody here, so help me God!’  Obviously he was one of the ones that hadn’t gotten any sleep.
He had only needed to ask one pedestrian where he needed to go.
‘Ah!’ Tony looked down at himself and realized he was barefoot in nothing but his pajama pants and indeed utterly unarmed.
"I really don't know what to think anymore. The evil wicked people I have encountered previously all said they did what they did to inevitably abolish evil and make the world a better place. But I really don't see how you can make the world a better place by doing evil things."
‘But at least,’ Tony thought. ‘He hadn’t healed all the way.’ Tony continue to frown at the scans.
They were quiet for several minutes more. The weight and significance of their plight weighing heavily on their minds.
“What a fascinating question!  I could answer in so many different ways.”  She pondered for a moment.  “I have two reasons why I am here.”  She laughed.
Although, at first he was morbidly satisfied to hear that he was not the only one to get zapped by these things. He hated to think that way but after a few more zaps he found it harder to care. That was until the electromagnetic fields created by these critters interfered too much with the main com line. Steve found that he could only communicate directly to one team member at a time after that.
A/N: Am I a terrible person?  Who knows…  All I do know is that Calamity is very right.  It will get much worse from here on out.  I’m sorry Steve, I’m so sorry.
However Natasha, also seemingly with Coulson and Maria, was a bit unhappy with Tony’s response.  Everyone had been working tirelessly to find this woman and all the sudden Tony had come up with the information they been working so hard on.  She interjected.
Sensing Tony’s line of thought Barnes took several deep breaths to calm himself.
Tony's consciousness snapped from awe to terrified.
Johnny, seeing that Steve was genuinely curious and not at all upset at having his privacy invaded, continued back to the door.
“And hey, you would have the top three floors of the tower all to yourself, mostly. I’ll still be here.”
“God, you’re a self-deprecating idiot. It did matter!” Bucky shouted at him suddenly. “You kept both of us alive, something I wasn’t sure even I was capable of. Maybe this was the best way for things to turn out-”
What does she mean? If she’s asking where it all went wrong then he would definitely like to know that himself. Because he certainly does not know what the fuck happened.
“You should give it up, Stark! I have you right where I want you!”
Iron Man swung around quickly and knocked the guy out with a percussion grenade. One down four to go.
“Hey.” Sam greeted.
Bucky ran a hand through his hair and took a deep breath. “I know I can do this.” He said again a little less forceful but no less confident. “I refuse to be Hydras prisoner any longer. They’ve controlled my actions for far too long. They will not control my decision in this.” He clutched at his shirt over his heart. “I refuse to continue to be paralyzed by the fear and hate Hydra created within me. I will not be a useless lump on the floor while everyone else is putting everything on the line to fight this fight.” He looked up at Tony, suddenly making eye contact. “There’s no way in hell I’m taking a backseat for this.” He smirked.
