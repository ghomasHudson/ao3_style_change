The fire station is quiet. The door to the garage remains shut as cars pass by in the street and the parking lot remains mostly empty.
First a little rolling around the bed, then this vamp's head would roll - a two-in-one jackpot. But they never made it out the bar. Cas, of course, had to interrupt them, the little cockblock. Not that Dean recognized the habit at the time, only seeing a stranger ruining his night.
An earnest nod.
"I can't." Castiel's voice cracked. "Just ... I can't anymore." The clang of a bottle against the wooden table. "He needs help", he continued urging, pleading.
"Dean, no!" A hand slapped the gun out of his grasp.
Furrowing his brows Dean cocked his head and looked the man over: slightly shorter than him, shaven jaw and mussed brown hair, a black suit underneath the trench coat with a loose blue tie. Fetching. Was his behind also something to behold? "You're standing right there, man."
Back in the motel, he searched the books again. Snakes!
Dean cocked an eyebrow. "You enjoy watching me? Creep."
"I'm watching over you", the man explained.
His face revealed nothing.
Dean cocked his head worried, "You walked?"
"You're not acting like it." Castiel stepped toward him, reaching his hand out for him.
"Don't you know nothing?" Why was Cas so clueless about all the normal things? "You're supposed to come after me, but you didn't." The bond was here, right? They obviously liked each other too much.
Which made his resolve crumble a little more each day. Angels weren't supposed to enjoy earthly things, losing their magic because of it. Was Dean dooming Castiel to a worldly and mundane existence? Could he stand being responsible for that?
The barkeeper threw him a strange look. "Messy break-up, eh?"
"You're all alone out here?" Most vampires lived in nests, but Dean hadn't stumbled upon one while in town. The strong smell of iron and damp earth that this man emanated told of his true being.
"Angels don't eat", Castiel answered.
"Your effort was commendable as well", a slight nod.
The man didn't answer. Lips pursed in a serious expression, piercing blue eyes intensely watching him.
"Don't fucking do that", Dean shook his head. How was he to get distance between them if Castiel just followed him? "Why're you here? Didn't you get my message?"
Dean's silhouette hurried out the doorway and Castiel hurried after him, but he only saw a dog run across the parking lot and into the distance. "Come back", he said but his voice was low and defeated. Inside his chest still whispered the echo that he had fallen in love.
Suddenly, a cold shiver ran up Dean's spine. Something dark and ominous raised the hairs on his neck. "… Are you watching me?" He didn't dare to look over his shoulder.
"Come back, bitch!" Dean regained his footing and ran after her.
Right, of course not. Dean stole a long, wishful gaze. It was still the safest bet, given the stupid shit Evangelists spouted. Who really knew if Heaven was like that or not? "You'll love Chastity."
Cas's lips were pressed into a thin line. "It's not what you think it is."
Another hard slam on the breaks. "What the hell?!", Dean's heart beat too fast.
The motor roared, Castiel drove off the parking lot. The echo in his chest whispered of pain and sadness. He believed it better to rip the band-aid off with one fast, smooth motion. No prolonged suffering, but a quick and decisive action. If they didn't see each other ever again, the Bond couldn't matter. If their relationship ended right here, right now, the Bond would die on its own. So Castiel believed, hands strangling the steering wheel.
"It's a great movie", Dean objected defensively, "The flaws are what gives it character."
Castiel paced through the small motel room. How had it become this bad? Once they had been happy, or what went for happy in their lives at least. It wasn't all sunshine and rainbows for them, but it didn't have to be. They had each other, that was enough.
Dean looked at his lover closely. Worry lines drawing over the beautiful face, jaw muscles clenched, sorrow drowning his eyes. Blue eyes that always reminded him of the sky. "How do you stay so strong?" A sky without storms. Whenever he fell into Castiel's deep blue eyes, he felt free. Like he was a condor soaring through that sky. "I love you, too."
Humming along with the song Dean knelt at the side of Baby and ran the sponge over the rim of one of the tires. He felt a little exposed and a little silly in these jeans shorts, but also a little sexy and a little whimsical. His own backyard could handle it well enough.
"About that! Stop or I shoot!"
Instead of this discovery feeling good, feeling like an invitation to cuddle and whisper in the night, perhaps to fill the room with a little more moaning and pleasure, instead Castiel felt hollow. They laid here skin to skin but not close. Heck, they had touched deeper than that, yet this shallow gesture was too much. Dean's body radiated warmth but it only raised goosebumps with Castiel, cold making his limbs twitch. A knowledge not new raised to the forefront of his mind: Dean was here for selfish reasons.
Violently Dean shook his head. "No!", he yelled, a tone of refusal. "You're a monster!" He loved Castiel, even when he betrayed him so maliciously.
"The shop's closed", Dean said grumpily and stood up. He didn't appreciate being sneaked up on. "Come back tomorrow."
If only anyone could do that ... Her hand on his cheek was tender, soothing, blissful. Once he had felt this way with Castiel, that seemed a long time ago. Why was he fighting his family? Tired he closed his eyes. Just one moment ...
Here, where an angel got lost watching him.
Slight indignation visible on the lips forming a thin, unamused line. "I'm an angel of the Lord, Dean", Castiel explained, "Hell has nothing to do with this."
A little light emanated from the palm of Castiel's hand lying over the broken wood and little creaking noises were audible. The cue stick was whole again. Then he bent down to pick up the ball that was rolling away.
"You shouldn't go with him", Cas said, "He isn't who you think he is." His lack of subtlety was almost endearing when it wasn't annoying.
The explanation was painfully obvious. "Because you like hanging out with me."
Moreover, Castiel was glad to be here, to feel the other's presence, had been looking forward to this moment. And it stung that Dean didn't feel the same. Another discovery echoed in his chest: Love.
An echo resounding in every fiber of his body, instinctively he pulled Dean closer and kissed the back of his wonderful neck again. Castiel wasn't averse to love, he just didn't believe in it, better to enjoy the moment that was.
The echo in Castiel's chest whispered of petulant anger. He packed in his clothes and the Liber Confidebat. The motel room was booked for another week, but he couldn't stay longer. After all, he was only in town to meet Dean - and Dean clearly didn't want to see him anymore. Suited Castiel well, he didn't want part in this Bond either. Not that it had asked, magic never did, otherwise he would've refused full-heartedly and ran the other way.
Images flooded his mind of Cas alone in a motel room, alone in his car, alone at the side of the road and longing. The distance between them long, but the bond wasn't breaking.
She shook her head. "What are you talking about?" Her feet morphed into a sinewy, scaled body, wound itself over the floor. Her hair was a threatening hood.
He shook his head, her hand stayed. "I'm fine!", a sharp sound in the silent room. Cold gripped his heart. His family wanted him gone!
As well as were them. His suspicion now on his family. Betrayal pierced through his flesh. They talked big about helping him, but them second guessing him did the opposite. How could he trust them in a fight, when they wanted him gone? Family wasn't what it used to be.
"See what?"
"She was a fast machine", Dean sang into a wet sponge, foam dripping down his hand, "She kept her motor clean." Spinning around to the music his foot swiped at the bucket of soapy water, almost kicking it over and spilling it everywhere. The sloshy sounds drowned into the loud rock music. He leaned over the broad hood of the car, arm outstretched and muscles working as he drew big sudsy circles. White streaks of foam decorated the black metal. Soon she'd shine in the sunlight again. A little smile on Dean's lips while he sang along to the song and washed his car, the love of his life. His Baby was a real beauty and deserved his full attention. Not that he had anyone else to give full attention to.
And Castiel stood on the lone road waiting.
Castiel's hand stroked his cheek gently. "There's always another monster. You're not killing them, you're killing yourself. Don't do that. I want to be with you. I'll always be with you. I love you, you hear me?"
"What ya doin' here?", Dean asked and leaned against his half washed car, arms crossed in front of his chest.
With determined pushes Cas guided them towards the door. "She's a … friend, kind of. Nothing what you think."
The moment was quiet as he sat on Baby's hood, the morning sun in his face and bandages around his hands but holding a beer worked fine enough. He flipped through his dad's old journal. Dean knew every word by heart, nothing about how to break this bond. Still, his eyes flickered across the pages searching for a hint, desperation guiding his actions.
A thoughtful nod. "I received your message but … I was under the impression you liked the time we spent with each other as well, so I was worried you were in some kind of distress. I am your guardian angel after all."
"Angels aren't supposed to enjoy any earthly circumstance."
The door flew open loudly, Dean's kick almost ripped out its hinges. The barkeeper yelled: "Hey! Don't fucking start shit, boy!", and the guests looked at him. But Dean didn't listen. His eyes focused on Cas and his demonic lady friend sitting at their table all relaxed and surprised. He couldn't say if the image of the two kissing heatedly was his jealousy or the bond showing off, but it was stuck in his brain.
The wall clock showed two in the afternoon, strangely Castiel hadn't visited Dean's workshop today. The angel had made a habit out of coming by in the early morning hours, maybe throwing out a comment about the news that clearly wasn't from a human, and he'd watch Dean work on a car for a while. Patiently, silently watching.
"See!"
"You'll see, there aren't any monsters. Promise."
What a nice family he had, stabbed him in the back like this. He was fine!
The angel Castiel stood at the entrance to the shop, trench coat obscuring his silhouette and blue tie slightly loose. "I now know what happened."
Castiel lay on the ground, held is rips and his lips were bleeding. "You don't have to do this", he pleaded. "You don't need to kill anyone. You don't have to face this alone."
"Duh, weirdo."
Their bodies intertwined just like their tongues did. No boundaries between them, just fond feelings, tender touches, caressing kisses, dizzying desires, penetrating pulses. Their breathing was shallow, hardly any room between their lips. Husky cries when they came.
Dean glared angrily at his lover. "Go away."
"Dean!", a desperate call.
"Love you, too", he whispered. For a moment he closed his eyes and savored the feeling of Castiel's soft touch.
Dean turns to Rowena once again.
Are you really sure that Chuck created all of you as equals?
(he takes a deep breath to control himself and gather his thoughts)
Dean laughs without any humor.

"My day started out pretty great. I got to school and made it to class on time, my first hour teacher is one I like, I even get to sit in between Jo and Dean, if he was in class. Speaking of Dean," Cass gave Dean a pointed look before he continued. "I was enjoying my class when this little shit-"

"Um.. I'll have a cheeseburger with a strawberry milkshake, please." Charlie said.
That’s not right.
Anything in it for me?
Based on your track record, I’d say that’s called for.
Sam’s thoughts finally take over him and he stands up, attracting Eileen’s attention as he starts packing his duffle with hunting supplies.
Dean takes a moment to process this information.
The camera ZOOMS OUT to see Alex standing over the group, and as we temporarily focus on him, his eyes flash black.
Yes, just without all of the struggles and hardships they had to endure on Earth.
SUPERNATURAL
The doors to the throne room burst open and the female demon from before steps into the room-- BELA TALBOT, now a demon. Her eyes glint black as she gives Rowena a sickly-sweet smile and we--
25 EXT. HEAVEN - LAKE - DAY
(urgently)
The library is empty and untouched as Sam enters.
Sam and Eileen enter the lobby to chaos. Officers are scrambling to get their things together. Sam stops one of them.
Dean and Cas sit close to each other at the table as Dean talks to Charlie and Stevie at his other side.
DEAN (V.O.)
Sam gives Dean one of his classic bitch-faces before he answers.
"You know, one of these days we should pretend we are dating just to see how everyone would react." Dean laughed, picturing his and Cass' families' faces as they screamed in happiness.
DEAN (CONT’D)
Just call if you need anything.
Okay, putting aside the fact that Michael thinks he and Adam are the same as you and me, whatever the Hell that means-- Cas... I was trying to be happy for you. I thought you were gone for good. I’ve forgiven you-- for everything that’s ever happened and for everything that might happen in the future. Because now that I have you back... I hate to break it to you, buddy, but you’re about to spend the rest of eternity with me.
You don’t have to say it, Dean. You’ve already said enough for me.
Despite the sarcastic tone, there is a hint of truth to Balthazar’s words.
Right.
CASTIEL
"What?" Dean asked.
CASTIEL
23 INT. ROADHOUSE - BAR - DAY
Hey guys, long time no see.
Dean and Cas look at Jamie, passed out in his seat, and the girl next to him screaming as the black smoke makes its escape.
Did the boys send you, or are you here of your own accord?
END OF TEASER
Focus on the Empty as it finishes forming, stretching as if cracking its joints after a workout.
Castiel is laying down, having just arrived in The Empty after sacrificing himself to save Dean. Tears are still fresh on his face, and he is quick to wipe them off as he sits up and notices that every being here is awake, the sound closing in on him. Above it all, however, is a voice.
Well, I don’t think we’re gonna be gettin’ to bed again anytime soon. What d’ya say we get some coffee, hm?
Oh, well. That doesn’t really matter. You’re here now, but not for long.
"So what did I agree to down there?" Dean asked when he heard Cass close the door and sit on the bed next to him.
Focus on Jack and The Empty, facing off, then--
Eileen looks at him expectantly as we hear Dean’s voice through the phone.
Oh, a couple thousand. Not nearly enough to take over yet, but I’ve got patience.
CASTIEL
I’d say that’s still a pressing matter, wouldn’t you?
Eventually, Alex nods his head slightly.
Yes, Dean.
As the figures get closer, we see that they are Sam and Dean. Tears stain Sam’s face as he struggles to carry his brother’s lifeless body to the Impala.
CASTIEL
Sam and Eileen exchange a worried look as the officer rushes off and we--
Our son. He’s--
"Wait, you got Dean Winchester to go to The Roadhouse and not eat pie?" Becky asked. Michael dropped the spoon he was using to stir the spaghetti and ran over to Dean, checking his temperature.
If I tell you, it won’t come true.
Well, I think we found Jamie.
EMILY
Michael’s reaction is the most subdued, only a thankful smile and nod of his head.
Oh, not you! Balthy and Mikey!
I'm a demon looking for power and in need of an army. What do you think my business would be?
Not a hunt.
Emily pauses in packing up Nathan and Reese’s things when something small tumbles out of a pillow and onto the ground. She picks it up to see that it’s a small box-- a ring box. One of the boys was going to propose.
Okay. Well, uh, I’m gonna do some laundry first and then--
I’ve taken over as God.
DEAN (CONT’D)
At the fire station.
EILEEN sits on her couch reading a book when her phone suddenly lights up and buzzes next to her. She checks the notification and frowns in confusion as she gets up and heads to her front door, leaving her phone on the couch.
Hi everyone! Thank you for reading this episode of Supernatural Season 16! I love and appreciate all of you!

Welcome back, Samuel. How’d the hunt go?

Gertrude turns to Emily and drops her hand before motioning for Emily to come closer. Hesitantly, Emily crouches down in front of Gertrude.
We PAN to Castiel as he processes this conversation between the brothers.
(steadily)
Alex? It’s me, Sam, then one who was going to help you find your friend. We found him, he’s by the Ferris wheel if you want to meet us there.
"It doesn't taste like dog shit, Dean. Don't you remember what that tastes like? It's not this." Cass said.
CASTIEL
Dean sighs and attempts to collect himself and forget his own outburst, but Cas looks at him with sympathy.
Panic consumes Cas and he flies away before we CUT TO--
Why are you here. What do you want with him?
But you know when your choices started being taken from you. You can pinpoint exactly when you stopped being given a choice. I don’t know when that happened to me. I lived my whole life without any choice, because of dad, and then apocalypse after apocalypse, and then I found out Chuck has been in my head, controlling me. I don’t know who I am anymore.
Eileen shakes Dr. Lewis’ hand as well before she and Sam leave.
CUT TO--
Sam looks back up at Eileen, startled.
Castiel cuts Dean off before Dean can even completely open his mouth.
They found Jamie.
5  EXT. FOREST – CONTINUOUS
The group all turns to Cas, who nods his head in confirmation.
Every other demon she passes reacts with terror, but every time she waves a hand and the demon crumples to the ground.
(teasing)
Deal.
Before Meg can finish, Castiel, Balthazar, Gabriel, and Michael all appear at Jack’s side.
"I can't deny that, but they must figure it out for themselves!" Chuck replied.
When she comes back, I’ll be sure to let you know.
I thought angels can’t get drunk.
You all think you’re so much better, but you might just be the worst of them all.
I’m God now. I can take whoever I want from here as I wish.
What about the Empty, then?
Dean takes in a shuddering breath, but Castiel cuts him off before he can say anything.
MICHAEL
It’s okay. I understand. I’ll cover for you, don’t worry about it.
Come to get payback for what happened in Hell? ‘Cause I gotta tell ya, I don’t think this is really the place for that.
DEAN (O.S.)
No, I got that-- I just thought you wanted to focus on the crap we’ve got going on already.

"Really, Dean. You've known Lucifer all your life and yet you still insist on antagonizing him like that." Cass rolled his eyes.
Castiel stands up, the jacket still in his hand, and attempts to move past Michael. Michael holds out an arm to stop him and grabs the jacket to inspect.

How soon?
Sam, Meg, Dean, Cas, and Jack all gather together again, holding hands as Jack brings the back to Earth and we--

"Shut up." Dean groaned and looked back at his half-eaten bacon cheeseburger. Suddenly he wasn't hungry anymore.
Dean stands in silence and drinks his beer for a moment before Castiel and Miracle join him.
BOBBY (CONT’D)
"That is not where I pictured this story to go." Gabriel laughed.
Why did you bring me here?
Alex and Jamie break apart, Alex now resting his weight against Jamie instead of Sam. Jamie faces towards Sam, Eileen, Dean, Cas, Meg, and Jack, but he doesn’t quite meet any of their eyes.
For a while, they can’t find anything other than blood, but then, on the collar of Emily’s shirt, Eileen finds something.
CASTIEL
Rowena pulls out the bullet that had been used in her attempted assassination.
Jamie! Jamie?!
Santa Monica Pier to be exact.
ACT ONE
CASTIEL
Despite his attempted reassurances, Dean can’t help but think that he has been missing out on celebrating his birthday.
"I'm your guardian angel", the man replied, "I'm always watching you, Dean."
Dean shook his head sharply. "No, there isn't a day off, ever."
His Impala followed her bus to the northeast of the city. Close to Lake St. Clair. Neighborhood safe at night, tidy front yards, the house stood directly at the shore. As Dean walked around, he saw snakes slithering in the grass. He snuck in the back door and tiptoed through the house. The girl was upstairs humming a soft tune. As he entered the room, she was taking off her clothes and her gray scales showed. A scream.
"For your protection." Castiel sighed exhausted.
"You know exactly what I'm doing here." The bond was a two-way street after all.
"Your family wants you gone. Your brother thinks you're crazy. Your lover thinks you're a monster." Her eyes weighed him down. "But I don't. I will love you. I will make you happy. I will help you."
The cries at night kept him awake. So many nightmares harassed his lover's dreams, made sleeping unfeasible. Therefore life was impossible. He woke Dean up too often, but he had no way of sharing in the pain they caused.
"Drop the act, you ain't fooling no one", Dean hissed.
"You were gonna kill that girl. How's that fine?" Castiel threw his hands up desperately.
He tried to push his lover aside, but he stood firmly. "Leave! I have to kill her!"
"Of course I don't ..."
"I would've come sooner", the angel explained, voice serious, "But I couldn't fly here, so I had to walk."
"No, you don't!" Castiel shoved him backwards. "You need to come to yourself, that's what you need to do."
Castiel smirked softly at him. "I will find a solution, don't concern yourself with this."
"I watched the first
Sam and Castiel shared a troubled look. It dawned on them, that he knew.
Another shove. No budge. "Go!" He threw his fist into his lover's face. This monster needed to die, no matter the cost.
"You're awake? Good." The naga snaked around the basement.
Startled Dean bumped his head against the open hood. "Ouch", he muttered peeking around the car.
Good show. "Open your mouth wide and swallow this." His gun was ready to shoot.
Abruptly Castiel stood up, a startled look from Sam. He took the keys to his car and left the motel. He needed to find Dean and, more importantly, he needed to stop this madness. Dean needed help and he had to realize that, now. Otherwise he would end up on death row.
He only knew, he would stand with Dean. Always. He accompanied him on his self-imposed quests, supported him and tried to save him from harm. Harm he did to himself but also to others. Dean wasn't a bad person, but he needed help to find himself again.
A sliver of light fell underneath the kitchen door, not strong enough to eluminate a tile. The same way hope felt in his heart: A small light doing everything it could but still failing to reach someone.
Castiel fell onto the bed, face pressed into the covers. There had to be a solution to this! The TV show joked happily, the laughter of an audience reaching his ears. As if they were laughing at him. Deservedly so. Biting into the Burger, he watched.
Castiel hummed pensively, "Maybe I should then. What song would you recommend?"
"Is that a good thing", Dean huffed refusing, not prepared to take a compliment at this time.
But Dean floored the gas pedal, the heavy Impala heaved itself forward.
Did Castiel listen to the song as intently as he watched Dean?
She hummed a soft melody. The door broke open. "Don't move, bitch", Dean yelled at her. "This was your last molt."
Nothing.
"Woah!", Dean stumbled backwards equally freaked and amazed. "You just- Damn." He wasn't getting used to this. "Thought I take you out and introduce you to some … earthly circumstances to enjoy."
"Yeah", Dean's voice broke out of self-consciousness. "I want to … But in tales kisses are powerful, right? They can make a prince out of a frog or seal someone's fate. That's too much. You should go back and be an angel. You are an angel!"
A deep sigh escaped Dean's throat, longing and pleading. When was the last time they were so close? He couldn't remember. His hands grabbed the trench coat, pulled Castiel closer.
How did you hide it all for so long?" A low growl, masking hurt with ire.
A strong jerk on his arm, he almost fell over backwards. "What the hell!"
Had he heard him? "I didn't mean it like that", Castiel defended himself, talking both of them out of this idea. "I just meant, this moment is nice." It was easier to live without love, so he had done for the longest while. Being alone and free was an advantage whenever a hunter came to town, whenever Castiel needed to uproot his life again. But the past couldn't dull the person in front of him, not only a nice body for sex but Dean's childish humor was contagious, his bravery in a fight was inspiring and his caring nature couldn't be drowned in beer. This moment was nice indeed.
Frustrated Dean hit the steering wheel.
The sincerity was painful. Another fault of Cas's that could be endearing if it wasn't annoying. "I take my chances."
"There's a first time for everything", Dean voiced one of his mottos. He bent down to the bucket and the sponge, his Baby still wasn't clean. A loud wet sound and a little squeak as he began to wash the windshield.
He stood in the ruins of an old church, a small building of charred stone and without a roof, though its steeple still stood high. Shards of glass hung in the windows and threw colorful splodges onto the floor but the pews were all gone. Alone the stone altar filled the room. Not that he believed this was the mysterious way in which God worked. Mysterious it might be, but God's work most definitely not. A witch and a familiar were far removed from the divine. However, Castiel often found solace in places like this. Calm, focus.
Castiel wouldn't let that happen, not on his watch.
The cold shiver that ran down his spine and the raised hair in Dean's neck became a welcome reminder, something to trust in. Castiel was with him. But not inside him, yet. So he put his want into the chorus of the song.
Dean bared his teeth like an animal. "Monsters need to die." His voice dark with killing intent. "And you have to stay out of my way."
Dean's head was buried in the engine bay of a 1967 Ford Mustang, complete with orange racing stripes. The owner was a douche insisting on picking her up this afternoon, only giving half a day to fix her. Luckily, Dean was freaking awesome at his job.
Castiel shook his head. "You don't need to save me. She's just a girl, no danger to anyone. You don't need to do this."
"I'm in the middle of something here", Dean explained and gestured at his car. "If you wanna stare at my ass some more, be my guest." The jeans shorts were the perfect attire for that and admittedly a little wasted since he had no one to give them some attention.
With a slight smile Castiel sat back down at their table. "That was … different. Stimulating."
"Can you blame them?"
"You make me feel like I'll be okay", Castiel's voice was quiet. "I want you to feel the same. With me."
He saw through her lies. "Nagas don't deserve mercy", he spewed coldly.
Castiel shrugged briefly. "Angels don't adhere to what human call gender."
There had to be a way to make this stop. It was already hard to leave someone you liked, didn't need to make it harder by showing him how sad Cas was. They could only share a moment, not a life. Besides, Dean hadn't much life to share. A safety measure so he couldn't lose much if a hunt went wrong, which it inevitably would. This was how every hunters life ended even if Cas rescued him, only difference then he had something to lose.
"It is", the man agreed and turned around on his heels a full turn. "I wonder what happened."
"I apologize for being late today", Castiel said as he stepped into the shop, a deep frown on his face.
Dean Winchester never ran away from anything!
Dean spun around startled, feet slipping out from under him and his back pressed against the car. "What in hell! Who the fuck are you?", he yelled surprised and angry.
In a dark corner of the bar at a table sat Cas, but he wasn't alone. Him opposite sat a dark haired woman, more precisely a demon in a meat suit. Dean smelled the sulfur from here. Worse though, she was holding Cas's hand and if that jovial smile wasn't flirting, nothing was.
At the same time all these thoughts and pictures, some his and some Cas's, were burying him. An earthfall of images and feelings he couldn't fight against, sometimes tearing him up in cursing or crying or laughing. He wanted to hit something, preferably this magical bond that was fucking everything up, but the vast country had nothing to offer but some trees. Which he parked his car at and tried it, fists and tree bark colliding, pain erupting. Only thing he earned were bloody splinters in his bloody knuckles, not worth it. Neither did it elevate the strain that was tearing at him, nor did the bond magically go away. A courtesy magic didn't know.
Dean glared at him defiantly. "Oh, you do it all for my own protection. Fuck you!"
The angel was watching him intently.
She bend down to him. Her scaly fingers caressed his jaw. "You're teeming with life. But your loneliness shackles you." Vertical slits narrowed down on him. "Be my mate."
"Amor, et demetam posteriora tua!", he spoke, ordering love to go away. The affection between a witch and a familiar created the bond, without it had to wither away. A small orange flame puffed up as the match hit the concoction. Then …
Dean would talk music and movies, but the angel didn't really
"That's my line!", Castiel shouted back. Now he stood in front of the naga, guarding her. "Don't do this! She's just a girl, goddamnit."
The trench coat and suit looked comically out of place in here. A concentrative furrow on Castiel's face while he maneuvered the cue. Shooting. The tip of the cue caught on the green and the stick broke in half. The ball jumped off the table with clamor.
Dean wasn't here, that sucked absolutely.
Screeching tires. At the last second Dean hit the breaks hard and turned the wheel frantically, the car drifted around its own axis. "Shit!" He punched the steering wheel, the honking horn drowned out more cursing.
humor. He tried though which warmed Dean's little heart. Nobody had made an effort for specifically him before, to listen to his favorite music and to watch his favorite movies.
Dean chewed on his burger. "I found the case. It's her", and nodded to the counter.
"Sure, that's the important thing here", Dean barked back, a little bit of sarcasm was helping him understand the situation. "I thought your magic was gone?" Apparently it was still enough to scare the living bejesus out of him.
A long nod, a little hum agreeing. "I noticed. Don't worry about it."
A forgettable night, so he had expected at the time. He had been on the vampire's tracks for a few weeks already and it should've been easy. If Dean hadn't been in the way. Now Castiel knew he wasn't merely a human, but close enough. Stubborn human, insisting to turn off all warnings and go with a vampire anyway. The fight outside the club was hard and ended bloody, as all fights with vampires do.
"You can have a good life - with me." Her voice filled his mind with relief.
The echo in his chest whispered differently. The Liber Confidebat wrote differently. His own eyes had seen differently. But Castiel had fought the odds for too many years to surrender now. He rather follow his own path than everyone else's, this had served him well.
"What a behind to behold …", a deep voice mused.
Tugging at his flannel one last time Dean took a deep breath. "Well then", time to take an angel out on a date. "Uhm, Castiel?", he asked aloud into his apartment, "I'm not sure how prayers work but, uh, please hear me? I have a plan for us tonight, so-"
Bashful Dean looked down at the oil-stained rag in his hands, his fingers suddenly nervous fiddled with it. "Maybe you shouldn't."
"But ...", he interjected.
It was Dean's duty to show his guardian angel how wonderful and breathtaking it could be.
"Hey Castiel", he started his prayer, voice hoarse, "I, uhm … I don't want you to come to the workshop anymore. I don't want you to watch me anymore. I don't want you as my guardian angel. So, if I need to fill out a form or something, just mail it … Goodbye?"
Dean yelled: "Castiel!"
She hissed warningly and her long, sinewy body wound through the room. Long hair formed a
"Well, I do. It's quite a nice view actually." Dean threw the sponge back into the bucket of soap water.
Castiel shook his head. "How can I take the pain away?" His hand now rested on Dean's knee. "How can I save - you?"
He clenched his fist. Dean turned away from the kitchen door and left. Hearing Castiel like this was hard to swallow and no amount of beer would help with that. Beer only helped with sleep, sometimes.
", Dean explained, his heart beating a little faster. "There's more."
"I'm seeing it with my own eyes!" This wasn't going like planned. Well, Dean didn't so much plan this and more had the gut feeling that he needed to do something. He was a fighter, so he fought.
Dean threw his jacket on a chair. "She's a monster!" A snake monster. Gorgon? Apep? No, she lived at the water, maybe Jörmungandr? Koloowisi?
Dean sat back down at their table and took a big gulp from his beer. Nervousness fluttered around in his stomach.
"You shouldn't be able to see me", the man answered.
"She was the best damn woman that I ever seen." Even half attention would be an improvement at this point. Almost some attention from the cute guy with the 1978 Lincoln Continental Dean had worked on this past week. A crappy golden nightmare of a car but it was the guy's first, an emotional attachment Dean understood all too well. So he had worked extra hard for the guy with the raspy voice and baby blue eyes. God, he was too easy sometimes. Dean had flirted a little, some intense looks and some winning smiles and a witty line or two. Pretty sure the guy had flirted back, after all he'd been at the shop every day for an hour or so watching Dean work on the car. Who did that?
"Made a meal outta me, and come back for more. Had to cool me down to take another round", Dean looked straight at Castiel as he sang. Please get the hint!
Snorting with laughter Dean shook his head. "You fell on your head or something?"
A brief nod. "Then trust me. She's just a girl, a human, innocent girl. You won't save anyone, when you kill her. You'll only hurt people. I don't want anyone hurting anymore. And I know, neither do you." Castiel's voice was quiet but strong, a comfort in the damp basement.
The bang of a door falling shut. Dean startled awake. Light shined through the windows. Was the naga finally home? He wiped the nightmare from his face. A quick check of his gun, then he left the car silently, stalking towards the house. He sneaked in through the backdoor. The house seemed quiet. Was she upstairs again? He held his gun tight and moved up the stairs, pressing his back against the decorated wall.
DEAN (CONT’D)
"Ooh! Deanie's got himself a girlfriend!" Gabriel teased.
No, she got away before I could do anything. I don’t know where she went, but she is still alive.
So, she’s got demons working for her making deals against Rowena’s commands.
"Ugh! Fine!" The voice called back. Then, a bored-looking man with blonde hair walked out of the back room and came up to where Ash was standing next to Dean, Cass, and Charlie's booth. He smacked Ash on the back of the head before turning to the three teenagers. "What would you ass clowns like?" He asked.
END OF ACT TWO
Sam, Gabriel, and Castiel sit around the small table in the kitchen. Dean grabs one last beer before he heads to the table and passes the bottles out as he sits down next to Cas. He takes a long drink of his beer before he finally looks at Gabriel.
For now, I want to focus on redesigning Heaven to make it happier. Everything should be connected, and angels and souls should be free to roam wherever they wish.
As Balthazar pointed out, Heaven is indeed under new management, and as that new management, there’s a few things I would like to change.
I need you to find someone for me.
On Dean, confused and with slowly rising anger.
The same trail that all five victims were killed near. And I’ve even got a picture of where Maria and Gertrude were killed.
Not that much-- how? I lived for about forty more years after you died.
And Donna, Jody and the girls, Charlie and Stevie, all the other hunters... you just forgot about them, too?
JACK (CONT’D)
She snaps her fingers and Dean and Sam both double over in pain, coughing up blood and gasping for breath as Meg vomits up wisps of black smoke.
(a pause as Dean smiles at the rest of his family and friends)
17 EXT. PIE FESTIVAL – DAY
"They were annoying me." Lucifer shrugged. "I may or may not have given them eight-year-old fries." Michael burst into laughter and Becky smacked Lucifer upside the head. "No need to do that! Ellen already did!"
22 EXT. FOREST – CAMP – CONTINUOUS
Dean pulls his phone away and looks at it in shock.
EILEEN
Aw, come on. Just once I’d like to forget that the archangel in my head is just in my head.
Yes, well, I didn’t expect you to be here either, yet here we are.
"Okay. Coming right up." Lucifer said before turning in their order and going to get the orders from other tables.
Dean finally catches his breath as he continues glaring at the spot that Bela previously stood in.
DEAN (CONT’D)
See? I just had to kill the demon because he was hurting my business. You can't fault me for that.
15 EXT. HEAVEN – THE ROADHOUSE – DAY
GABRIEL
CASTIEL
"I'd rather not say it." Cass said.
Eileen nods and turns off the tv then gets up to join Sam in packing.
An exchange.
Sam looks back down at his computer to see a promising article that he clicks on. It’s a copy of a newspaper article from 1917.
Gabriel, what--
Well--
Sam, Eileen, Cas, Dean, Meg, and Jack all back away from Alex to give him some more space and to discuss their course of action. Sam, however, continues to glance at Alex, making sure he is okay-- or, at least, as okay as one can be after being possessed by a demon.
"Fine." Castiel replied when Dean said that, then he just went behind the chair and tilted it forward so Dean fell out and he jumped over the back of the chair, sitting down before Dean could even get off the floor.
(angrily)
Yeah, well.
Yeah, that works.
The rope that was used to hang the vics.
JACK (CONT’D)
As Castiel, the Empty pulls Jack’s hands away from his ears and forces Jack to look up.
CASTIEL
Nothing. I’m fine.
GABRIEL
"You have a brother named Lucifer?" Charlie asked.
Well, I guess, when you put it like that...
I’m sorry.
Hands-off and visiting your family are two different things.
Oh, me too, please! I'm about finished with this one.
There. See her?
Where are you taking me?
GABRIEL
The last of Chuck is gone. You are a free man.
Heaven’s controls have clearly been long-since abandoned, although the room seems to have been left in pristine condition. Computers fill the room, each one displaying someone’s Heaven, however, we don’t care about those. Our focus is on a control board with billions of switches and one master switch.
Of course, Sam.
Dean’s prayer fades out and the flashback ends as we CUT TO--
Emily?
I’ve changed, okay!
SAM (CONT’D)
"Okay." Dean and Cassie said at the same time, causing Lucifer to internally squeal because
"Go away!", Dean yelled and shifted into reverse.
Sheepishly Dean turned back to the car he was working on, leaning over the engine bay and his eyes were searching for a distraction. He didn't see nothing but Castiel's soft little smirk. "You must be starving walking all the way here. I left some of my lunch in the fridge, you can have it."
But the body next to him tensed again, more even and the breathing stopped for a second before it quickened. Dean reached out to the edge of the bed, wiggling his body out from Castiel's hug.
The longing for Dean his heart was filled with still there and drowning everything else. Pain still echoed in his chest that wasn't his. Sadness shared between them, not at all diminished by the many miles they were apart. Now defeat joined in.
How could this happen? A question Castiel didn't know the answer to. This magic was too old to be known and too rare to be expected. Perhaps worse, this magic wasn't a witch's. Dean should have told him what he truly was, so they could've stayed away from each other. But no, the boy rather play with the dangers of ancient magic and Castiel was left to find them a way out. Dean's fear to be truly known by another person brought them this mess, yet he suspected Dean wouldn't learn his lesson. Skinwalker, flimsy excuse.
defensive hood around her neck. A cobra ready to strike.
Another punch. One more.
A shiver ran up Dean's spine. The same feeling when Cas had said those three words, too sincere and too comfortable. Would he block this bar's door as well? Would he come and rescue Dean again? Not that he needed it - absolutely didn't - but the thought of someone who cared was nice. Not something Dean could afford.
"It's worth the risk", the man said and ordered them both another beer. "Name's Benny."
"But I do", Castiel responded calmly, piercing blue eyes searching Dean's face for answers.
"Hello Dean", a raspy voice greeted.
Castiel tilted his head puzzled. "You want to kiss me?"
The man frowned. "What?"
"Why couldn't you fly here?", Dean asked, the words came only slowly out of his mouth. Foreboding butterflies ravaged his stomach.
"Yeah, but", Dean objected, "Don't you wanna try it out? That's what we're here for." What was a boys night out without a nice beer and some karaoke?
Castiel didn't get that far, his sincerity and kindness about her situation got them both thrown out of the club. Some things weren't made for honesty. But it must've been enjoyable enough since the next day the angel came back for more chatting und not drinking his beer and more karaoke, and the next day after that as well.
What was a little mindless fun? It didn't matter if angels didn't exist, as long as Castiel had strong hands and soulful eyes. Dean would like to explore them more and to be explored by them.
"Wait", Castiel asked.
"What the hell?" Surprise. He was taken aback. "No!"
With a nod of the head he led the angel to a table, glasses of beer and some pretzels. Some poor woman was singing her heart out at karaoke. "Honest effort", Castiel applauded her.
Cas stood up, hands held up appeasingly. "Dean, what're you doing here?"
Dean scoffed. "Read a book." So he threw the one in his hands over to his lover. Castiel barely caught it.
It was a dimly lit room, wooden panels covered the walls and the tables showed some nicks and scratches from a lifetime of use. Dean was trying to teach his guardian angel how to play pool. Emphasis on trying.
Questioning Castiel tilted his head, "More?"
Sam's voice was agitated, a hint of accusation: "You agree with them?"
Dean's response: "Man, what a party pooper are you?" and "Wanna come to my place?"
Hot, burning pain shot through his head and bit paralyzing into his limbs. Black light spread through his eyes. "Fuck ...", only a whisper of distress.
A tight grip, Cas held Dean's hand firmly. "I did no such thing, I would never."
"It's freaking not", Dean cursed and fell out of the bed, a low thump as he hit the floor. Rustling in the darkness. "Don't say that. Don't say any of that!", his voice grew loud and frantic. "This is just sex, understand? I gotta go."
The yearning was still alive between them.
"I'm becoming human because I enjoy our time together", Castiel explained, his hand tentatively touching Dean's. "Because I want to kiss you as well."
Admittedly, it didn't stop being creepy even if Dean found the highly concentrative expression on Castiel's face cute. A combination no one else could pull off quite as well.
Dean sighed.
"Damn." Dean swallowed hard. Those hands looked soft and unburdened, but their strength was undeniable. Sexy.
Castiel didn't do a good job of this, apparently, and it tore him in two. Dean was hurting and he couldn't do much more but watch.
He growled. "Fuck you", and struggled against the bonds.
Easiest solution: They keep their distance from each other. Should be easy, Dean barely knew the guy and he was a bit creepy sometimes. But from the sound of it, this wasn't the solution the angel had in mind.
Another pause, longer this time. Shallow breathing, sometimes interrupted by the wish to speak. What could they say? They were talking about betraying their family, their brother and lover. There were no words for that. Just shame and anger. Finally Sam said flatly: "He wouldn't get much help anyway. They wouldn't help him, they rather he rot in a cell ... or worse."
"A very earthly circumstance", Dean answered smirking, "A great one."
The pain spread into Dean's senses, but he didn't give in. He had to be strong. "I do. The world is falling apart, I need to save it." Repeating himself again.
Dean dialed the volume of the music up to eleven. Wide, empty fields lay to both sides of the highway, occasionally a tree or a lonely house dotted the horizon. Perhaps if he watched enough nothingness pass by, his heart would again not pay attention. Perhaps he needed to drown it in cheap liquor until it was indifferent again. Perhaps fooling around with a few skanky waitresses was a good enough distraction.
Cas grew frustrated, his brow furrowed. "Would you listen for a second? We kissed once, ages ago. Her flirting is just teasing, it's a joke."
She hissed at him. Her voice was mangled by her transformation. "Bullets don't hurt me."
He nodded weakly. "Yes." No fighting, no monsters, no death.
"I'm saving you, idiot."
That night had grown promising, the someone else flirting back. A whistle as the stranger came over to him. "Your behind looks so tasty, I might bite it", the man's voice had a drawl to it.
Hopefully the curt grunt hid Dean's curiosity.
Dean scowled. "I don't need saving." He didn't deserve saving, especially not from Castiel. He could still feel the cold, tender lips on his own. Guilty conscience. "Where's my gun? And the torch?" Dean looked around feverishly. "I'ma kill this fucking monster!" He had to annihilate the sign of his own betrayal.
Another heated kiss shared between them.
"Wait", Castiel asked again, suddenly sitting on the passenger side seat.
"I do", another earnest nod.
"I heard you sing along to that a lot over the years, I think I should manage", Castiel agreed.
He should've said no. But Castiel had said yes. A room in a rundown motel, a bed hardly serviceable and yet they had spent the rest of the night there. A sweaty, sticky night and Dean's moans had been stuck in his head for weeks after. Thought he could feel Dean's lips and hands on his body for weeks after. Longing in him even back then, a desire for more he should not have given in to.
"What were you thinking!", Castiel shouted at him.
Dean huffed amused, "Sure, that's the problem."
Casually leaning against the car Dean looked the strange man over. "Are you trying to tell me you never had a hamburger?"
inside him compelled him to be here, but it hurt.
This was fucking wrong. But it was the right thing to do.
Blackness filled the room. Not the light of the moon nor of a streetlamp fell through the window, thick ugly curtains shielded from any disturbance. At least the ugly pattern wasn't visible in this darkness either, hardly a relief. The sticky air of sex was dissipating steadily, leaving behind the stale scent of a room neglected. What did he expect from a motel in the middle of nowhere? Castiel felt a bit of sympathy for the room, wasn't its fault that it sat here and its human didn't care. That was human nature in action.
Dean downed the last of his beer, half the bottle, also eerily similar to that night. A night he had spent in a bar similar to this, had drunk a beer similar to this and a cheesy song had played in the back similar to this. To be fair, Dean spent most of his nights like this. They often ended similar as well, with him flirting his way into someone else's pants.
"Yeah, I did but you shouldn't!" Restless and confused Dean ran a hand through his hair. Could he manage enough strength to break it off again, to Castiel's face even? Doubtful.
"You didn't miss anything", Dean waved the apology aside with a greasy hand. "Except for some heavy cursing, this one was way too attached to its fanbelt." He kicked against the tire equal parts playful and disdainful, elbow still hurting.
Hands pulled erratic at the fabric of their cloths. They needed to touch each other's skin. Liberated moans. Fingertips stroked hot skin, gripped strong muscles, needed to feel more. They held each other tight. Heart racing in their chests, sensible by their closeness. Each new kiss, each soft touch was love incarnate, their feelings coming to life with their flesh. Another deep kiss, lips moaning deeply.
There was something kinda cute about him, like a teddybear. "I can keep you company for tonight." A deadly teddybear, though.
But Castiel protected this monster and dragged him out the house. Betrayal blinded Dean's mind.
The naga curled in a corner of the basement. Her mangled voice cried: "You're mine, forever."
Slowly Dean opened his heavy eyes and saw his lover's sorrowful face. Did he know? Could he see, how weak Dean had been? He bit back the burning in his eyes and stood up. "What are you doing here?"
An intoxicating rush swept through their blood. They both sighed with relief, the soft touch tingled on the tip of their tongues, entwining around each other. Their breathing blended together.
"You almost shot that girl dead!", Castiel was still yelling at him.
Dean was pacing through his shop, frustrated with the obvious right thing he should do and the very wrong thing he desperately wanted to do. "Fuck", he cursed and screwed his eyes shut, fists shaking.
But they both had. A location spell later and they'd spent another night together. And another one. And another one. Then they started texting and calling each other almost everyday, mostly Dean telling him that he found the best cheeseburger in the state or what Led Zeppelin's best song was. They should've seen. Now they paid the painful price of a broken heart because they couldn't have more than a quick hook-up.
Her smile was bright and happy. "Here you go, Dean." A cheerful wink.
"I need to save you." Dean panted hard, his knuckles hurt. "I need to save you."
This would be so much easier if Cas was like everyone else, just some forgettable guy. No one to develop affection for, no one who'd think twice about this little fling. They should've never met a second time. He should've never given Cas his phone number. He should've never felt homey in Cas's arms. But Dean liked to fly close to the sun, the dangers of magic as alluring as those blue eyes.
The naga slithered away.
Now the figure moved, Castiel stepped closer. Brows furrowed serious as he peeked through the driver's side window.
"I know that smirk", Castiel observed with furrowed brows. "You mean sex, right?"
"I must be losing more and more magic."
"Be careful, I might bite back", Dean answered with a smirk. He had a weakness for men with prickly beards, even when they were vampires. He believed in making the most of things and that included the gift of an impromptu hunt. So, he gestured for the stranger to sit next to him.
"That's all I'm askin' for", and Benny raised his glass to drink to that.
Castiel jumped out of the bed himself, his hands searched for Dean in the black room. But didn't find him. "I know that, alright, I know." The door opened, the night outside almost bright from moonlight and a nearby streetlight. "Don't go!"
Lazily he caressed the body next to him, his fingertips felt the soft side with fondness and the warmth was creeping up his hand. The thick curtains hid the time, it felt like they'd been lying here for hours, like morning should be right around the corner. At the same time they had just said hello and barely shared a kiss, all of the night was still in front of them. His open eyes led him to believe he saw the other's neck, the brown hair and light skin inviting a kiss. Though his eyes didn't see anything his lips found the neck anyway and put a gentle kiss here.
"You're a dick, you know that?", Dean shouted at Cas while he walked over to him.
Castiel lay an arm around his shoulders. "Let's go home. We'll find you good help."
Not today, not in weeks. Inside him was turmoil, a state he did not care for.
A theatrical grip to his heart Dean gasped in shock. "How can you live like this?"
"How can I not worry?", Dean asked, voice still too loud but he didn't know where else to put all this tension. "I want to do even more stuff with you, like hug you and kiss you and - and stuff like that. But I can't be responsible for you becoming human - and what if that'll make it stick?"
"I'm not your buddy", Cas answered, blocking the door with his body, "Neither is he. He'll hurt you."
Hard Dean swallowed. Perhaps this was more frightening than funny after all. "Always?"
But this wasn't a monster he could kill. Well, Cas was a witch so he potentially could be, but he wasn't an evil witch. Moreover Dean liked Cas, he truly did - this was way scarier than a monster. He missed talking to Cas. Talking! So much for horny men, he scoffed at himself.
"My cloaking magic failed because I lost some of my powers", Castiel explained and stepped closer. "Angels aren't supposed to enjoy watching their charges."
Well, for the time being.
Dean growled. "I'm fine!"
Dean didn't want to be here. Well,
The door of his old Lincoln Continental creaked as it opened, masking Castiel's sigh. Of course he knew running away from the Bond was futile, yet he was about to try. Of course Dean wasn't the only one afraid to be truly known by another person, after all being alone was safe and spontaneous and simple. Being with another person was not.
Who was the creep now, eh? Dean was an easy lay, so easy in fact he'd go down on something that didn't exist. Desperate much? He huffed about himself, shaking his head. Sam told him to have some standards when it came to flings, more so telling him that Dean should try a serious relationship for a change. Nah.
"Since the day you were born." He came a step closer.
And Castiel let him, again the hollow feeling. Was a kiss that bad?
The road was long. A lifeless stretch of asphalt. In the middle of the road stood a lone figure, a shadow unmoving. The trench coat lightly flapped around the figure's legs.
Or so he had thought.
Dean closed the book with a loud thud. "And you think, betraying me's gonna achieve that? How stupid do you think I am? How stupid are you?"
"You are quite the character, Dean Winchester", the gravely voice spoke with Castiel's very own brand of sincerity.
"How do you stay strong
"What're you doing? Why? Don't, please!" Her body trembled.
"But I exist. And you can see me somehow." Again the man was looking around, presumably for clues to this mystery. "My cloaking magic must be faulty."
He shot her anyway. This moment of shock he used to ignite the torch. That would hurt her.
A drip on his forehead. Another drip. He squinted. Dim light, damp air. He moved just barely, his body was tied to a wooden post. "Fuck", he cursed.
Dean almost ripped the pages from the book as he flipped through. "And you want to put me in an asylum! Who's the bigger asshole here?" He couldn't see the words, blurred by ...
"You wanna fight?", Benny asked.
"A joke, eh? They never turn serious, sure." Finally Dean stumbled over the doorstep again into the open.
He sighed and fell on a chair. His hand ran through his hair, a desperate motion. The faint memory of Dean doing the same thing. He always did, or at least he used to. Even when they had first kissed, years ago and with too much beer on his tongue, but that's just how Dean tasted. Dean's fingers had been entangled in the strands of his hair and Castiel loved how these strong hands could be so gentle with him. How shy Dean had been that first night, because it had been the two of them, that meant something. That had been new for both of them.
The gravely voice wasn't made for singing but Dean's ears found it beautiful. His skin was prickling as he listened, as he watched, as he dreamed of what else they could do together. Had Castiel ever lay in a bed? Or taken a long, hot shower? Presumably, angels didn't need to. What a stale life.
Back at the motel he hit the laptop and searched the internet for clues. What kind of monster was she? Where was her lair? How could she be killed? But he found no answers in the books.
"Yes, I do!", he screamed deranged. "No one else can. She's gonna kill you and Sam and me and the entire world! I've seen it."
"No, why?", the man asked slightly confused.
The muscles in the body next to him tensed and in the silence he heard intensely slowed breathing. Dean was still awake.
"Lonely is the night", Dean suggested without hesitation.
Dean licked over his lips lascivious. Was it crazy that he wanted to fuck his guardian angel?
Cas's blue eyes bored into him as if his glance alone was a command.
"Fuck you, you lunatic!" Her voice was thin, tears on her cheeks.
Castiel tilted his head quizzically.
Dean sighed heavily as he wrung out the sponge, water splashed around the bucket and a few drops hit his exposed thighs, the jeans shorts covered nothing actually. Unfortunately, he had not asked the cute guy out on a date. A sourly missed opportunity. But he had made it a rule to not hook up with customers. It was unprofessional. Plus it lead to more trouble than the mediocre sex was usually worth. The last straw had been the crazy bitch who had sliced up all the tires of every car around his shop. The sex wasn't good, she'd given him a rash and then that? Nope, Dean was done with this shit.
He emptied the bottle and got up. Whatever this stupid bond shit wanted from him, it couldn't force him to watch this. So he left the bar, only to sit in his car stone still. What was he doing?
Dean's hand clutched hard around the bottle of beer, a hot wave of jealousy flooding his body and mind. A dark growl rumbled in his throat, "Fucking bitch! Better get her dirty hands off Cas."
The severe injustice to Castiel's tastebuds had to be rectified. Angel-schmangel, it was somewhat eerie to think about but Castiel radiated sincerity and kindness. Dean wasn't above a little desperate gambling for the chance to hook-up with a certifiable hottie.
A warm smile enveloped Castiel's face, from his lips to his eyes and every little line inbetween. "It would be my honor to kiss you, Dean, and to be a human with you."
"You can see me?", the man spoke, the gravely voice hit Dean right in the groin.
"I'm an angel of the Lord."
Dean shook his head. Ridiculous! A hunter died early and bloody, that came with the job. A home didn't. Besides, if Cas wanted a companion, romantic or magical, he probably already would have one. He had lived a century or two at least, Dean was sure from the way Cas spoke, so there been plenty of opportunity.
"We call that
Surprise in Castiel's eyes. Hurt. "She's just a girl!", he repeated.
"I love you." A silent whisper disappeared into the night.
"She's just a girl", he pleaded. "A human girl. An innocent girl. Don't do this."
"How about we take the day off?" Castiel's voice interrupted his thoughts. "Sam hasn't found anything yet, so ..."
Now Dean veered away from himself and Castiel didn't know what to do. He could handle Dean getting lost under the hood of a car or in a bar playing pool or watching some cheap porn. He knew Dean, that was all build in. But now he buried himself in dusty, old books, searched for weird news stories and drove all across the country and for what? To kill some imaginary monsters or find stupid items to save the world from ... Castiel didn't even know from what.
"Yes, for your protection", Castiel repeated. "We care about you. I care about you, a lot. I can see how this is tearing you apart."
"A plan?", the flapping of wings accompanied his words. Castiel suddenly stood right there.
In hindsight, it absolutely was. Dean wasn't good at following commands, not for a lack of trying but because he often saw a better way. He knew how to hunt, he was good at this. And at getting laid by a waitress. "You're in the way, buddy."
"I'll show you", he promised and stood up. "Let's make tonight unforgettable."
