The implications of the texts sent and received during the ride are causing shifts in his head, and now there's a pressing need to re-examine, reorganise and see if this conclusion does, in fact, fit with the things he knows to be true. He needs to review both memories and facts to see if the new data is compatible; if the theory covers all angles.
“So,” John says again, slowly, deliberately, his spine straight and his eyes measuring Sherlock without any trace of the underlying uncertainty that had been present as he’d brought up the subject of… restraint.
His head pounding slightly from leaning over the side of the bed, Sherlock scrambles for his phone where he spots it halfway under the nightstand. He recalls nothing before the sudden sound of his phone meeting the wooden floor, but he must have reached for it, still half asleep, and accidentally pushed it off the table.
There are interruptions - like John breaking away to let Sherlock breathe - but that only makes it harder. So Sherlock never lets go, keeps pushing in, and when John's not backing off slightly his movements are just as desperate and erratic as Sherlock's.
John watches the involuntary tears that well up in Sherlock’s eyes as he tries to swallow. John wipes a few tears off with his thumb before he pulls almost all the way out again.
“Deficits in social-emotional reciprocity, ranging, for example, from abnormal social approach and failure of normal back-and-forth conversation; to reduced sharing of interests, emotions, or affect; to failure to initiate or respond to social interactions.”
(It will be easier with practise, Sherlock knows this. Once the mechanics and the expectations are better defined, he will be able to do this almost effortlessly.)
“Psychotherapy?” For a split second, Sherlock can see the surprise on Mycroft’s face, before the mask of determination returns. “And you can’t try that alongside the medication? You have to jeopardize everything you’ve built up these past few years? You might recall what it was like when you were seventeen, but I doubt you remember your early twenties as clearly as I do, given that you were constantly high as a kite. Do you realise what a relapse now could mean?”
John’. John didn’t get angry or upset because he knew he was going to have the last laugh. Suppressing a chuckle he said, “Hey listen, it’s Sherlock’s birthday today so I am inviting you for lunch with us. Can you make it to…..” Before he could even finish, Phil as usual started to bully his way into the plans. “Oh yeah for sure, 1 PM at Northern Lights right? That is the best place around our college and Sherlock would love the place. He always accompanies me there. We shall see you at 1 PM, I will bring Sherlock in my car.”
It’s what makes it possible to continue like this, Sherlock knows, and that’s all there is to it. Or at least, that’s all there ought to be to it.
John’s close now, looking up at Sherlock, who straightens his back automatically, needing his body to express something he’s not even remotely close to actually feeling.
What she tells him is mostly confirmation of what he’s already pieced together, and there’s a sudden thrill because he was right - he saw it - he connected the pieces and observed the pattern and drew the right conclusions and--
(Sitting in a chair opposite John when talking about this would made it feel too similar to therapy, and Sherlock's had enough of that to last him a lifetime.)
Sherlock should take better care of himself, his father would say, but then his parents are miles and miles away and do not have to endure Sherlock's poor sleeping habits or his steadily increasing smoking habit. It's no longer their immediate problem that their youngest son dives into his newest interest with an energy that seems boundless, learning how to fence only to excel at it in record time, before spending the next three weeks hardly leaving his room, his brain too useless to see through the greyness that was waiting for him around the corner as soon as he reached his goal.
“Look, you deduced my limp, and my shoulder, the first day we met. Can't you be content with that… level of damage? For now. Until you deduce the rest. But - when you do, don't tell me. I’d rather not know, alright?”
In the end, Sherlock finds that even a text conversation with a chameleon psychiatrist from his past is preferable to his own thoughts at 5 am.
Conditioned, sexual response to certain kinds of pain and a vague and rather objectifying sexual attraction to John's more dominant behaviours notwithstanding, sensation is his main motivation.
“I'm sorry, my mistake,” John says, clearly attempting to sound serious for Sherlock’s benefit, and Sherlock might scowl, but there’s no edge to it, because poorly concealed amusement is not the worst possible outcome.
Therefore, Sherlock takes advantage of his knowledge of where John's gaze tends to linger a fraction longer than on other places on Sherlock's body by exposing even more of his neck as he's leaning down to adjust the slide on his microscope. John is barefoot, but his footsteps still gave him away as soon as he approached the kitchen doorway.
“So you work two jobs, then? Is that why you look so worn out in the end of your shifts?” Matthew says with a smile.
It's absurd, this impulse to defend his brother, given that it’s essential for their… relations that John retains a healthy suspicion towards everything Mycroft might insinuate about Sherlock in the future.
Sherlock knows that if he’s going to do something about the state of this particular area of his body, it'll have to be now, before John has seen him fully naked.
At the end of his first night of reading, Sherlock is left with said category as well as mood disorders, depressive disorders, bipolar disorders and personality disorders, all of which he will have to go through more thoroughly in order to eliminate each individual diagnosis until he finds something that seems to have at least moderate merit.
His other option is currently being let through the door by Mrs Hudson; unfortunately however it’s too annoying and intrusive to be seriously considered. Marvel it is.
And it won’t be that easy to just stop brushing John off, not really, because Sherlock didn’t even know that he’d been doing it in the first place. Just like he wasn’t even aware that he’d led John on.
Sherlock attempts to make his gaze as steady as his posture as he shakes his head, uncertain of what exactly he's negating with this gesture. There seems to be more than one meaning to the words, judging by the way John utters them and the way the arterial red is becoming more and more prominent before him.
“I'm a sensation seeker, you already know that. Pain is sensation. Pain administred by someone else is slightly less predictable sensation. You do the math,” he offers, finding that he doesn't even have to act to get that truth out just as blasé and nonchalant as it feels.
“Doctor Watson, I assure you that there are other things I’d rather give him, but I will give them to you instead, in case he… sees reason.”
It’s hateful, finding himself incapable of speaking in full, comprehensible sentences, but he’s had no time to prepare his words, and while his usual problem is an excess of the things, this is different.
“Right,” says John, pulling the duvet closer around his waist as he leans over the edge of the bed to scramble for his clothes on the floor. “You might consider showering before we go, though.”
John is frustrated, and he knows it doesn't help, knows Sherlock well enough to understand that this is a sore subject for some reason, possibly related to Sherlock's fears of ‘imposing himself’ on John sexually.
Sherlock draws in a breath, and John finds himself holding his own breath, waiting for whatever's to come.
He needs to hold himself together. It's a fine line, but prescription medications for a symptom he actually has should not be crossing the line, not even where John is concerned.
Focus - Sherlock’s not even trying to keep his focus, deeming the matter to be exceedingly dull, but even if he had attempted to do so, I think that this version of him hadn’t been able to, and that not trying in this case might be a bit of a defense mechanism - if you don’t care, you can’t fail. Sherlock’s having clear problems both in canon and in this story to sustain his focus and attention on anything that he doesn’t find interesting or relevant to his interests, and in my head, the reason he doesn’t even try to is the same reason as the one stated above; he knows he can’t. He used to try, but he never managed, and when he tried, it drained him of his energy.
Sherlock’s answer is short and dismissive, and he doesn’t bother looking up from phone as he puts the kettle on, still a bit warm from his shower.
Sherlock looks at John, at his body, at all the bare skin and imperfections and curious contradictions in front of him, and then John is stepping closer. For a moment, the question of whether Sherlock's expected to take a hint from their relative positions - if he's expected to fellate John here and now - races through his mind, but John leans his head down, and Sherlock's lips instantly come to meet John's, a slow, determined kind of pressure that soon becomes more demanding. Sherlock imagines that, for once, John can feel the internal pressure the same way Sherlock does, because while Sherlock’s brain might be wired wrong, there's nothing biologically freakish about him.
His trousers are somewhere around his knees and his erect penis is in John's hand, the hand that’s moving up and down, up and down, slowly, testing. There’s a groan next to his ear, and another erect penis is pressing - no;
Then, just as Sherlock realises that John can watch him, but that John is out of his own field of vision, a hand makes contact with his… hair.
The current correlation between the two might prove a bit inconvenient if this is to continue for any length of time.
Sherlock's hands are not in John's hair to hold him there, and John isn't sure whether it's misdirected consideration or simply an attempt to keep his balance that makes Sherlock cling to the wall instead of clinging to the man sucking him off.
John looks up at him, surprised. The orange is glowing more intensely, pulsing in a way that Sherlock has never seen anyone’s colors do before. It should not be important.
- and Sherlock pinches the skin on his left thigh through the thin wool until there are enough endorphins in his blood to make the vibrations bearable.
And now here Sherlock is, holding the catalyst for it all in his hand, doubting not only his own reactions but also John’s, doubting that John would think anything Sherlock did was ‘brilliant’ if he knew just how thin is the line between seeing connections that others miss and seeing connections where there are none.
John is no expert on these matters, but he's pretty sure that that's not exactly how this is supposed to work. Still, he doesn't have a better suggestion.
“OK, seems they called him ‘Lot’ and he had trouble sorting his documents to get treatment at a place called the Rushfordshire Clinic. Otherwise, there’s not much about him.’
Alternatively, in some cases it could be explained by a person having learned dysfunctional patterns earlier in life. Separation from parents and attachment disorders have been linked with self-destructive behavior, and with failure to engage in self-care behavior.
Sherlock considers not answering, because there's really no question posed and there's also no answer he's willing to give, but as the seconds go by, Sherlock finds an answer forming in his mouth, and he wonders why he'd give John that, but in the end, he does.
Mycroft delivers his speech in a matter-of-fact voice, and Sherlock has a vague recollection of something, a theory, that he can't quite grasp, but it still makes the blood drain from his face, his hands clasping at the tea cup, because on some level, he knows where this is going.
Of course. She might not be as bright as he is, but Helena never did fail to take his intellect and memory into account when dealing with him. She knows that he will have remember everything she’d taught him, and what had he really wanted to--
The lack of sleep will only aggravate his symptoms, and he knows what it costs not to pay attention to such things.
), all Sherlock had gotten was the awful, hateful politeness and attentiveness of John the Thoughtful Flatmate.
John, on the other hand, has no idea where to start. By the table, Sherlock’s face is still angled up towards him, his head turned in a way that exposes his neck quite distractingly.
Sherlock had allowed John to take something that John had very clearly wanted to take - which had also happened to be what Sherlock had thought he wanted as well - and he’d allowed John to see him like that, had done it despite his own instincts when it came to not allowing anyone else to know about this side of him. There'd always be that risk; the risk that he'd do something like he had done with [partially restored]. But John had liked it. They both had, in their own ways. John might have liked the physical aspect well enough, but for Sherlock it had been more about the… psychological? aspect of it. In his mind, the humiliation of his own submission and the way John had used his body to derive his own pleasure from had been on repeat more or less constantly since then, causing dryness of the mouth, palpitations and a tingling sensation in his midsection.
“I accepted a shift at the clinic tomorrow morning, so if you want me to pick up intestines or more laptops you'll have to come out with it now,” John says, his eyes back on the screen.
Resigning himself, Sherlock decides not to argue with John on this. John’s far less tetchy when his blood-sugar levels are stable anyway.
As always; my biggest and warmest thanks to my skilled beta, iriswallpaper, who helped me with the questions of 'insecurities' and who's patient with all my impulsive posting before giving her the chance to beta it first.
Turning the skull on the mantle, allowing it to face the dim light of their kitchen rather than the more illuminated living room, Sherlock knows that he’s never really freed himself of rituals no matter what he might have been telling himself over the past eight years. He’s only integrated them, made them part of his daily routine. He loathes magical thinking, but he’s rationalised his rituals as routines that will appease the other defect of his neuroanatomy, the one he refuses to let anyone name.
“Comparatively, yes. I can't say whether it's noticeable outside test situations yet, but there seems to be a discrepancy.”
John stops in his movements, looking up from Sherlock’s clavicles, cheeks flushed, lips more blood filled than Sherlock’s ever seen them. His eyes hazy, but still clear in their unspoken question.
We all experience this difference; the difference in the roles we have, but to people with BPD, these shifts might be more profound and leaving them feeling like they lack a core self, and instead are more like a fabric that soaks up all different colors and liquids that it comes into contact to, adjusting behaviours, emotions and beliefs depending on the situation at hand.
John’s doctor persona might be mild-mannered, but he takes great pride in his work, and Sherlock knows there are few things that make him as frustrated as poorly-practised medicine, including sensational research articles and the promotion of treatments that lack scientific grounding.
Perhaps it’s really self-destructiveness, Sherlock gathers. He’s no stranger to the concept and he’s no stranger to the behavior. He isn’t even sentimental enough to deny it. And if cocaine isn’t an option, and he has to live in this limbo some more, perhaps even finding himself wanting it to last, then maybe (a few pills and) a clean conscious (over how he treats John) would go a long way. The only problem would be if he fails in not harming John. This seems likely but other than hurting him in an attempt to avoid to get the chance to hurt him more, Sherlock finds that he hasn’t had any impulses to be Not Good (other than the imposing on John’s sexuality, but John denies that one, so that’s debatable).
Sherlock isn’t thinking anything. Well, he isn’t thinking about anything relevant to the corpse in front of him. Instead he’s watching John kneel down by the body, first doing an ocular inspection, then putting on vinyl gloves -
As Sherlock's reputation as both a sociopath and a consulting detective spreads, Sherlock finds that he can afford to test the waters a bit in terms of how he presents himself.
Sherlock rises from his place in front of the fire, satisfied with the way the logs are slowly beginning to catch alight. The room is aglow, the flames from the fire painting it in warm oranges and reds the way the heat of the shower painted Sherlock’s own skin in different shades of pink earlier that night.
John takes a breath, trying to come up with anything that he can do to move this ahead, but the man in front of him is making it so hard to think, to find a natural way to progress, to--
John’s at boiling point once more, trying not to let it show. This time it’s not anger. It’s something even more personal.
His new trousers certainly does a less effective job of showing off his long legs and his behind, but the cut is classic and silently tasteful. When worn with his new shirts, he finds that the combination makes him look less distinguishable, more average and more handsome than…
Taking the stairs two at a time, the boundaries of Sherlock’s sphere and John’s are markedly blurred. John’s colours bleed onto Sherlock from where he walks one step ahead, and Sherlock wonders if it’s possible to see it - see the reflection of John’s colors on Sherlock’s own skin.
They pass the sign to the rehab facility, and this isn't the first time that Sherlock's left such facilities without using the exit, but he shakes those images out of his head -
Now he's thirty-two years old and he has urges and people - even normal people - do this, but he's also twelve years old and unable to cry over the fact that in a few days time, everything will be over, and he won't miss anyone, because he won't be alive to miss anything. He's both, and he's neither.
After three days Sherlock can concede that some things didn't go according to plan in the lab that night, and people seem to assume that it's the chemicals he's referring to.
Everything's too easy, Sherlock thinks as he turns the Bunsen burner on. It's too easy, and that makes it almost impossible to endure.
“There was a poisoning. I’m still recovering. Look; tremors. I’m still poisoned.” Sherlock holds up his hand, forcing his eyes open too. The fine tremor is clearly visible.
Common factors in these meetings included laboratory setting and unexpected reactions to Sherlock’s persona. Differentiating factors included Sherlock’s grade of experience with interpersonal relationships and his level of self-control. Those two last factors
There’d been a vacuum - an empty place where something vital or necessary should have been - in John for as long as he could remember. It didn’t always surface; he soon became skilled at covering it up with other people and their needs and their reactions, but it never left. When not covered up it began to expand and diffuse into everything around him, and if he didn’t delimit it soon enough it’d lead to… things not good.
“That,” John replies with a smile in his voice, but the smile isn't his usual kind, Sherlock can tell from the sound, “was hardly my point.”
It seems like what they've started has a negative effect on John's ability to endure Sherlock's shifts, causing him to respond with shifts of his own.
John leads the way, but it's Sherlock who opens the door to his own room, then closes it behind them, breathing harder as John's hands are on him once more, rucking up his shirt from his trousers.
A well-known example of failing overcompensation, is observed in people going through a midlife-crisis. Approaching midlife, many people lack the energy to maintain their psychological defenses, including their compensatory acts.
“I thought you’d give your doctor a bit more credit than that,” Mycroft says, his voice carefully neutral as he puts down the saucer, adjusting the handle of the cup to align just so.
Rubbing the left - always the left - nipple, he lets his other hand feel the response in the right nipple. It's tightening, hardening.
John’s hand is sliding down the exposed skin of his throat. The fingers trace strained jugular muscles, following the tendons as they stretch out, struggling to accommodate the arch of Sherlock’s spine.
There's a huff that could be laughter breathed into Sherlock's mouth, but Sherlock isn't sure, because he fails to see what there is to laugh about. There’s too much to think about at the same time - the neurochemical responses to oral stimulation, the physical reactions caused by the tugging on his hair and the way he needs not to let any of these things show too much. Not yet.
John doesn’t break their eye contact, but as he surges forward to bite at Sherlock’s lips things becomes blurry and too close, and Sherlock finds himself shutting his eyes as teeth drag along his bottom lip.
All things considered, Sherlock’s brain handled the outing well, but there’s an undercurrent of pressure that’s slowly rising under his skin, because of the sounds, the movement and most of all the constant reminders of his obsessions that are everywhere -
Only once John has poured coffee into a mug - not offering any to Sherlock - does he look up. Their eyes meet, and John takes a seat on one of the kitchen chairs, giving Sherlock an expectant look.
The resistance offered by the muscles inside of Sherlock suddenly lessens and John’s fingers can slide in and out much more easily. He adds a third finger and sets out to find the prostate, soon feeling the knob of tissue and hitting it with his fingertip as he pushes in. Sherlock’s reaction is breathtaking; his whole body jerks and the sounds that escape are nothing but ultimately needy. Some day John will tell Sherlock not to attempt to suppress those sounds, but at this moment John’s too busy breathing to be able to get his own words out right. It doesn’t matter right now.
Something in his face must have given him away, because without letting his hand leave Sherlock's hair, John leans a bit forward to better see his expression.
"Have I ever wanted the fact that I'm an invert to be of greater importance?" Sherlock drawls, paraphrasing John's question with as much condecension as he possibly can.
“Will you be needing more?” the neutrally dressed woman outside his door asks and Sherlock shakes his head.
In this story, I see Sherlock as someone who genuinely enjoys pain and/or humiliation in a sexual context just for the sake of the sexual (and psychological) thrill. It’s been something he’s desired long before any thoughts of deliberate self-harm, and it’s something he does as an indulgence, not as a last way out or a desperate act to regain control. He likes fantasising about these things, but when he thinks about self-harm, it’s more like an intrusive thought. I don’t believe that his sexual enjoyment of pain in a sexual context is in any way an unconscious way to make someone else hurt him instead of doing it himself. It’s not a roundabout self-harm (or a self-destructive behaviour in which he uses sex to punish himself, which isn’t that uncommon, but not the least bit true in this verse). It’s not a pathology. The fact that his brain is indeed a bit differently and that, to use a colloquial expression, ‘his wires are a bit crossed’ does perhaps play in, because he has a very favourable reaction to pain.
Ruling out the most unlikely disorders turns out to be the easiest part. Delirium, dementia, substance-related disorders, psychotic disorders, somatoform disorders and sexual and gender identity disorders are immediately discarded, as well as some other broader categories that hardly seems to apply to him.
John is staring as if something in Sherlock's face will somehow fill him in. There's a flash of something not unlike… fear, just for a second, and Sherlock braces himself before he continues, feeling a pressure over his sternum that has nothing to do with compulsions.
Sherlock knows there are nuances, but it's one of those things he’s never quite managed to learn how to differentiate between.
Cutting himself off, Sherlock throws a glance at John and finds the mostly deep, saturated greens, blues and oranges accented by a nuance of sandy beige. John looks like he’s mentally translating Sherlock’s words before he gives a small smile and nods slowly, like he’s managed to work out something from between the lines.
In a few strides, John makes it across the room and crouches down by the tense, curled up form on the dirty, tiled floor. It only takes a few seconds for him to conclude that he’s neither injured or severely inebriated. He should have felt relief at that, but instead it only makes his anger intensify, because this really isn’t the time or the place, but he should have known that bound to happen one day.
The silence between them is thick, Sherlock’s pulse thrumming through his body in a way that has nothing whatsoever to do with pleasure.
This story has led to more than a few rather amazing things - several trips on actual silver birds, more than one very important friendship and a whole lot of interesting conversations, as well as a healthy dose of self-validation that comes from putting some of one's own little peculiarities into words, but letting someone else deal with them.
Sherlock has never been sure how to define anxiety, and therefore he's never been certain of whether or not he's experienced it.
Met with Sherlock's continued silence and apparent focus on the laptop, John takes a hesitant step into the room. He's seldom been further in than a step or two, as he’s always sensed that Sherlock's bedroom is private in a way few other things between them are. Now he takes another step, and it's hard for Sherlock not to look up, assessing the situation.
This particular tech is one of the few on the force that seems to think that Sherlock's reputation as both a freak and a sociopath is exaggerated, and who is therefore  willing to argue with him.
“Okay,” John repeats, slowly. “You’ve made your point. I’m-- It was never you who were ‘wrong’. What was wrong was the fact that I did what I did without knowing if it was something you even wanted.”
Sherlock's legs still ache slightly from all the running a few minutes earlier and a drizzle of rain is making his curls stick to his forehead the way that always makes him feel like there's something crawling on his face, and so he simply nods back, watching the tall woman try to argue her way out of the arrest while Lestrade just patiently puts his hand on top of her head as she bends down to get into the car with her hands cuffed.
It takes effort to will himself to adjust the focus on the microscope, and to continue his examination of the sample on the slide, but Sherlock will not let John shock him into acknowledging…
When John emerges in a striped dressing gown over pyjamas, heading towards the kitchen to grab something to eat before he falls asleep standing up, Sherlock speaks.
Sherlock; not attempting to lead in this. Not only accepting, but wanting (needing?) John to do so. The contrast to what they usually are. The contrast to what John usually wants to aspire to. The acquiescence to what John actually wants.
“I'm not,” Sherlock replies, and John knows that it's a lie. A lie Sherlock tells both of them in order to enable this conversation. “I am, however, not particularly eager to voice any inclinations that you might find… pitiful. My sexual desires differ a great deal from my preferences in every other aspect of my life, and while I'm comfortable with wanting them, I am less inclined to share them.”
Sherlock was thirteen when he realised that the feeling of being out of place, of the world being full of people just reading from the same, inane script whenever they interacted, and the mere hopelessness of it all were not universal. He’d thought that while most people were better at simply disregarding the notion and carrying on with their lives, these experiences were - unlike his boredom and his impossibly bright mind - shared by all humans.
“Will you ever respect that some choices are mine to make and that you don’t dictate the all of the terms and impose them on me? Will you ever let go of your megalomania long enough to do that?”
“Is his kid really going to want to see him?” John asks after they’ve walked in silence for several minutes, the heavy traffic in the street almost drowning out his voice.
Not that anyone save John would actually have to know. If Sherlock keeps things up, John might not even notice.
“I’m not letting you push and poke me. You’re going to stop doing that, because I don’t think you want to do that any more than I want to you to do it. I don’t want to say this, but it’s true; if you poke me, I will poke you. And you don’t want to get into that kind of game. I know your weaknesses and you know mine. I know that I can be cruel when I’m pushed far enough and I don’t know how you feel about this, but I don’t actually want to do that to you. Perhaps you want to, but I doubt it. I’ve never known you to be cruel for the pleasure of it. Let’s not play some manipulative game of mutual destructiveness. We’ll mess this up a lot anyway, let’s not add intentional cruelness to that mess, alright, Sherlock?”
John is absentmindedly rubbing the side of his neck, which is one of his tell-tale signs. His shoulder is bothering him. The cold, of course. His neck will be stiff from the way John compensates in his movements as soon as his shoulder is acting up.
To be surprised - just once; just every once in a while. Oh, what a splendid and rare thing, what a rush - what an absolute opposite of the thing that’s been lurking just around the corner of his mind and will now be kept just--
Without any studies to occupy his time, Sherlock has set out to once and for all determine what it is that causes him so much trouble with living. With a psychiatry textbook in front of him, he methodically worked his way through the diagnoses, searching for an explanation - other than his unusual intellect - for his being what he is. He's been ruthless, completely unsentimental about it all, because he’s no longer in a position where he can claim with even a trace of conviction that there isn’t anything wrong with him.
Lastly; the way Sherlock used deliberate self-harm as a way to 'regain control' or 'ground himself' might be functional, technically speaking, but there are more aspects to it than that. Dangers, social stigma, the closeness to suicidal behaviour (not in all cases, but statistically speaking), unwillingness to form other strategies to deal with whatever it is one deals with by harming oneself and much more. I've been working with patients with self-harming behaviour for four years, and what my patients have certainly showed me is that it is very much possible to find less harmful ways to deal with what feels unbearable, but also that self-harm per se is very rarely the problem in itself. It's the reasons behind that need adressing.
Sherlock shakes his head, instinctively opening up another browser window to hide the BDSM forum that he'd been reading. His smiles grimly to himself when he realises just how illogical his reaction is, given that John hasn't moved, only broken the silence, and that he's still seated on the opposite side of the table.
Phone still in hand, Sherlock passes the woman in the driver's seat a few notes and walks slowly towards the door that has now closed behind John.
Turning over once again, this time so that he’s facing John’s direction, Sherlock adjusts the thin sheet that he’s using as a blanket in the heat.
- because this is as illogical as Silver Birds and vibrations, but with the additional complication of being something that Sherlock might not want to dismiss.
In the mirror above the desk, he can see a face, and he knows abstractly that it could be considered attractive. He’s anonymous here in Edinburgh; he could go out and get himself laid and it would pass the time and it would ease at least one pressure.
- Sherlock’s notion that John is straight, and his knowledge of the fact that the physical aspects of what they’re doing sometimes makes John a bit distressed, contradicted by the fact that John initiates not only the sex, but the anal fingering, which Sherlock sees as a very ‘gay’ form of sexual act.
Sherlock nods, once, twice, three times for good measure. Perhaps it looks redundant, but he needs it to be Right.
John has poor sense of self; he identifies himself through the eyes of others and through different roles. Being in the army might have been a very comfortable thing in this aspect, because there's a strong sense of belonging, order and identity in there. The same can be said about his current line of work; being a doctor is a strong identity, and being a doctor in a team the way you might be at high-intensity workplaces like the A&E, ITU, psych and so forth offer even more of a team feeling, because you often need to work as one. In this chapter, John also uses his knowledge of what others might see in him to make sense of who he is - he fears what others might think of his relationship with Sherlock if it were to be known that such relationship exists, because that is something that John himself can't quite manage to merge into his sense of self. The attributes that he thinks will follow such a notion is nothing he associates with himself, and so he feels as though he'd be losing himself if he had to.
By his feet, Sherlock is waiting while John fights his own thoughts. His head is angled to the side where John must have been pulling even harder on Sherlock’s hair without realising. Sherlock is waiting, and John is waiting too, but he’s not sure what he’s waiting for. Perhaps for a plan, for an idea on how to go about this now that he knows that he can - but he still doesn’t know, not really, because ‘whatever you want to do to me is fine by me unless I say otherwise’ is not the answer he had needed to hear. He needs to know where the limits are, but Sherlock thinks that limits are like rubberbands and therefore only something to employ in order to annoy others, to snap them in people’s faces.
He makes a complicated face and puts a firm hand on Sherlock’s wrist, directing it and the cube away from where they’ve ended a bit too close to John’s face for comfort. Sherlock takes the hint and drops his hand, but picks up even more speed instead.
“We should probably leave this for now,” John says unsteadily, and Sherlock isn’t sure if he means this
is testing his pain reaction; performing a sternal rub as if Sherlock was an unresponsive patient whose level of consciousness he needed to assess.
It only takes a minute before Sherlock spills into his hand and John is thankful for that, because his hand is indeed very heavy from lactic acid and oxytocin.
John is never consciously cruel about Sherlock's oddities, but there are things that will inevitably hurt even more than cruelty. John might, for example, decide that babble about auras is enough to tip the scale from ‘amazing’ to ‘borderline psychotic’.
John’s hands find their way into Sherlock’s hair, and suddenly this feels nothing like their previous kiss. Breathing becomes hard, and not because Sherlock's forgotten that he should breathe through his nose (he’s nothing if not a fast learner), but because his chest feels constricted. For some reason, his body’s response to that is to shift closer to John, and his body seems to know what it’s doing, since the pressure and proximity ease that constriction slightly.
“Oh, I don't fret about it. Just get over whatever stupid moral objections you have towards subjecting me to pain and degradation and get on with it,” Sherlock says without looking up from his phone.
Even without comparable data, Sherlock's research on the more physiological aspects of painplay had revealed a highly probable explanation for this uncharacteristic and novel experience.
“Clearly, I don't have any such delusions at this point, and I haven't for two decades. Unfortunately, there are other symptoms that have proven to be slightly more resilient. Hence the… medication.”
Compensation is sometimes also used more freely in clinical psychiatry (at least in Sweden) as a description of what a person suffering from a psychiatric disorder or who has a neuropsychiatric diagnosis does in order to ‘compensate’ for some of the symptoms of said disorder or diagnosis by using some of their strengths or abilities, such as intelligence, knowledge, social skills, experience or mere force of will. “He compensates for some of his inattention by doing working extra hard with his homework”.
The morning light floods through the windows and Sherlock wants to close the curtains, to cover his ears, but he does neither.
Unfortunately, Sherlock can't tell John this, because doing so would mean revealing the difference in motive between the two. And Sherlock is more than well-aware that others - not even John - find his motives for most anything acceptable, so he tends to keep such things to himself, storing them neatly in the structure of his mind, knowing that they're there and that they're untangled and labelled and understood, if only ever by Sherlock himself.
Working as a consultant, he would normally be required to display at least decent social skills and be cooperative, and most certainly to explain his deductions step by step in a more pedagogical way. However, he is so brilliant at what he does that he’s given quite a lot of leeway, and doesn’t have to live up to those expectations, even this inability (or unwillingness) still gives him certain disadvantages, such as being questioned all the time. Sherlock is a (former?) drug addict with (in this story) clear traits of autism spectrum disorder as well as other neuropsychiatric conditions and his personality is not an advantage in this situation. But he is a genius who excels at what he does, hence compensating. He has to prove himself over and over again, and he does. But there are other - less ‘classical’ - ways in which he compensates as well; having John with him to smooth over some things, but also to look to for advice on certain matters in which he has a harder time than most, acting like the abuse of the other doesn’t matter, using his theatrical skills to fool others and by ‘owning’ his own inabilities; ‘high-functioning sociopath’.
“Just like my brain is me and the rest of me is an appendage,” Sherlock began, cozy in John’s arms, “You are mainly your humongous dick and the rest of you is merely an appendage attached to it. Yeah, you can tell Moriarty that.”
“You see ma’am, last night my two friends were attacked on the highway just outside the village, only about fifteen to twenty minutes from this very house. What’s this thing, it was peeping into rooms on the ground floor of your house which means it moves inside the village and waits for lonely travelers at night. This is extremely dangerous and this means we can’t even go around anywhere by ourselves after a certain hour. You need to do something about this please. We will leave after a few days but this is
“I-I was… I am sorry,” John said, standing up and holding on to one of the five tiered showcases for support, “I don’t know what I was thinking….”
“You are quite a judgmental little thing, aren’t you?” John said a bit curtly, “And who exactly are ‘they’?”
“Who says he is?” Greg countered. John blinked, once again taken aback by his ignorance about something. His assistant, one of the ladies who always remained in their vicinity and ready to help, quipped, “He wants you to keep looking, to be the one leading the moves in this relationship. You shouldn’t gawk into his face like an idiot but you must not come across as a shy wilting wallflower either. You see John, everyone likes attention. Over a period of time he too will give you the attention you seek but to get something, you must contribute something first. Please begin by asking him about his work, family, passions, ambitions, dreams, things he strongly believes in etc. Without these inputs you won’t even get a proper chance to have a constructive, engaging conversation with him.”
Sherlock realized he had muttered a few of those thoughts in his head. “No, nothing,” he replied briefly.
Sherlock was already torn between needing to cum hard and right away and prolonging the pleasure slightly longer by holding on just for a bit. He made a moaning sound and clung to John with arms and legs, kissing him hard and possessively. John’s eyebrows slightly rose as he felt the other man’s grip get tighter and he kissed him back, then smiled down at him as his hips continued to move. “Hey, I am right here babe, I am going nowhere. Why do you look so worried and anxious?! I am here aren’t I? I am right there with you and I promise for as long as I live I shall always be there for you Sherl!”
“Oh nothing to forgive about this, c’mon,” Sebastian seemed to make a lighthearted joke of it, obviously acting and pretending as much as Jim was, “As I said, he does have that kind of appeal. Anyways, good to meet you too! Actually, you need to forgive me, both of you.”
John was looking steadily at both objects. He didn’t say a thing for almost a minute, which added to Sherlock’s anxieties.
To his somewhat surprise, Sherlock batted his hand away. “What,” the confused man asked, “You don’t want me to do this to you. I mean, I could fuck you, blow you or rim you while I jerk you off, the opportunities are endless.”
“Tall tales,” Irene laughed dismissively. Sebastian joined her while Molly seemed a bit afraid. Anthea frowned but didn’t say anything. John had a faraway look in his eyes. He remembered the strange sort of feeling he had in the woods. It was indescribable. Someone was surely watching him and what bothered him more was this strong urge he had to find out who that mysterious entity was. The woods were practically luring him to come closer and explore.
- to follow, but instead Sherlock’s mind is cluttered with images of things that have never happened and connections that don’t exist.
He hears his footsteps moving into the next room, and suddenly there are no colours left to distract him, and for some reason it feels like a loss. It shouldn’t be like this, because Sherlock knows it’s just in his head, knows that he can defeat this and what do these papers even mean, he can’t focus and--
It’s not a sulk, though. It isn’t anything, really, Sherlock thinks as he rips the sheets off his bed in order to rid the room of the smell that will otherwise keep evoking sensations that he can’t currently afford.
Which leads him to this; Helena knows more about his malfunctions than anyone else, Mycroft included. Knowing what she already knows about him, there’s not much Sherlock could do to make her think even less of him, so one pathetically hopeful question can’t really make matters worse. And while he hates every direction this conversation can take, he won't be able to store it away until he's asked this. Because he needs to slay dragons before he becomes the hero he ought to tell John not to believe in.
The carpet needs vacuuming, and Sherlock needs to find release, and first things first, Sherlock thinks, but is interrupted as John pulls away, breathing against his throat.
Of course he’d known that the box wouldn’t still be there. Logically, he’d known. He’d told John about the box, and given John’s character and profession, it would be highly unlikely that he’d let a box containing illegal drugs remain in the possession of an ex-addict. Still, as long as Sherlock hadn’t opened the cupboard, he couldn’t be quite sure that the box was actually  gone. It was a bit like Schrödinger’s cat, but in this case it was ‘Sherlock’s cocaine’ that was the object or conception in question. And now he knew that there wasn’t a cat in the box, and no box in the cupboard. What he didn’t know, however, was if he ought to be relieved or distressed, but he found that his brain settled on feeling none of those emotions. Instead of reacting, his mind blanked. Sherlock stared at the empty shelf, trying to react, but failing to doing so. It was just an empty space on a shelf, and emptiness wasn't something new to him.
Executive functioning is a theoretical construct representing a domain of cognitive processes that regulate, control, and manage other cognitive processes. Executive functioning is not a unitary concept; it is a broad description of the set of processes involved in certain areas of cognitive and behavioural control. Executive processes are integral to higher brain function, particularly in the areas of goal formation, planning, goal-directed action, self-monitoring, attention, response inhibition, and coordination of complex cognition and motor control for effective performance.
Then, without any prelude, Sherlock feels John almost close enough to touch, and then the light from the fire is obscured by John leaning in in front of him. It’s a struggle not to flinch at the suddenness of it, and it’s not right that he misses the intention and the movement, but John is leaning closer, making Sherlock instinctively move backwards.
“How would I know?” Sherlock shrugs, too occupied with his phone, trying to find other contacts that can provide him with additional information in order to enable him to find an alternative way to take down the four leaders of the network.
But there will be ten guests, oh I see, it will be ready in a jiffy. I knew you were a pro at this much as you were in running a drug cartel at one point in time. Thank you, I might even
John had a budget of sixty to seventy thousand and so the amount was no big deal for him. He, however, had not planned on a pre-owned vehicle and that too something so dressy and flashy. But when he saw the other man hankering for it and Sally rattled off about how good the automobile was and how many eminent people owned it, he got convinced.
This was too much for Sally Donovan and she came forward and tried to clear the air. “Now-now please, wait a moment Sherlock because you don’t understand the background. You’re accusing the superintendent unfairly. He had no idea things were not well-managed here……” But Sherlock did not listen to her. He glared at her angrily for a moment and interrupted, “Not
John wanted to counter those points, deny, scream, rage with frustration, but he knew the stakes were heavily against him. From last evening’s fiasco when he’d been spotted entering the flat with what appeared to be the trappings of a ‘in-home-date’ and now emerging from the same bedroom in the morning, he had nothing really to favor his ‘truth’, that he was not gay and Sherlock was just a housemate.
If they hadn't gotten caught in the collar of Sherlock's T-shirt... The fabric is threadbare, and Sherlock would have been able to feel the warmth - would almost have been able to feel each fingerprint - had they continued to move down his collarbone, over his pectoral, reaching--
“Why would he do that? It’s not like he ever cares about that if it’s not related to a case. In any case, if he tried to fit in he did a pretty lousy job for a genius.”
- had proven that the disappearance was planned by the woman herself. Sherlock had the choice to just live and let live. He isn’t sure about how he feels about the “live” part when it comes to himself, but Sophia will surely live no matter if Sherlock tracks her down or not.
In the mirror he eyes the pale skin that will burn easily in the sun and turn reddish and flake. No tan lines anywhere - body lotion with sunblock, a lesson learned early in life. His skin is currently painted in different shades of pink from the heat of the water and the rub of the soft towel.
As Sherlock makes the call, it strikes him that he hasn't felt any compulsions for the entire duration of their break-in.
(What John is allowed to be - is slowly allowing himself to be - when they do this-- It’s more operative than the mere attraction to a particular set of genitals--)
In psychology, cognitive dissonance is the mental stress or discomfort experienced by an individual who holds two or more contradictory beliefs, ideas, or values at the same time, or is confronted by new information that conflicts with existing beliefs, ideas, or values.
(Too much? Too soon? Too unmistakably male? This could be the tipping of any of those scales, and Sherlock’s mind is preparing itself for the rejection and--)
His own hands. Tactile indulgence. The worn fabric of John's cardigan, the shift of muscles underneath it, the sharp tips of his newly-cut hair, the scapula underneath Sherlock's hand, moving as John's hands move on Sherlock's body. His hands slow down as the kiss does, because there's something awkward in letting your hand rummage restlessly over someone else's body when the movements of your mouths are no longer just as hungry.
His fingers fly to his lips, feeling them, trying to make sense of whether it really happened or if--
. Sherlock is still standing in the middle of the sitting room, unable to make up his mind about where to position himself. He digs his phone out of his pocket and begin to randomly swipe the screen.
Inside his shoes, his toes are tapping. A silent rhythm that grounds him, reminds him that it’s not just a story he’s just made up, not a magic trick to lure John back to him, but the truth.
- ironic, absurd. He knows it isn’t a sign, he knows that nothing he does will either prevent or hasten the end of the world.
Sherlock’s intestines seems to be making very advanced attempts at leaving his body and John seems determined not to pick up on any signals that Sherlock doesn’t want to talk at the moment. Meanwhile, Sherlock’s looking out for more silver birds, but there are none to be seen, which is almost worse than if there had been one -
In the freezing air outside, Sherlock seems to regain some of his coordination and manages to walk almost without John’s support until they reach a bench as far away from the party as they can get without actually leaving the area.
“It’s not like you didn’t know what that dosage and combination would lead to,” she concludes, her foot still wiggling. Sherlock wants to reach out and grab it until she keeps it still.
He pushes in inch by inch, feeling the tightness of the sphincters making it almost impossible to push further. Sherlock must have done this before, as Sherlock claims to have had sex before and the Sherlock John knows would try everything at least once, in the name of science or experience. They are somewhat similar in that regard, really. But even if Sherlock’s done this before it must have been a while and it feels almost like doing this to someone the very first time (which is another of those things that shouldn’t be a turn on but is, at least when coupled by the notion that this is
“Ta, found them last night, though it took some time,” John says, voice equally neutral. “Figured I’d need them if I was to talk to you.”
Sherlock steals John an ashtray, and if there was ever a second of doubt about whether John would be uncomfortable with recieving a (stolen) gift from his (gay) friend, that doubt all melts away as John laughs until Sherlock can’t stop himself from joining in.
Sherlock wants to transfer at least some of that feeling to John, but his own movements feel rigid and even the rhythm of his strokes falters. He finds himself gripping harder, without intending to.
“Hey, you can’t drag Watson away now, he’s just getting started on his beer,” Phil says. “Have a beer yourself!”
“If you mean blackmailing dozens of powerful people with dubious morals in order to establish a position where she’s basically untouchable even to the British government, then yes, I’m a fan.”
The questions on the forms have clearly been designed for normal people, Sherlock reasons. He doesn’t particularly recognise himself in any of the ones  about suicidal ideation, because they ask him to compare things to how they were ‘before’, and Sherlock doesn’t remember a ‘before’. Death is a constant, and so are his thoughts regarding his own death.
Sherlock lets out a breath and repeatedly runs his thumb over his fingernails, the sensation as familiar as it is - objectively - pointless. Subjectively, however, it does serve a purpose.
But to John, that’s apparently not acceptable, simply because Sherlock had used pain for other purposes over a decade ago.
There’s no simple answer to that carefully neutral question, but his heart races as he realises that wherever he was thinking of going, he doesn’t have the right to go there.
Trying to focus on his own movement on John’s cock, Sherlock tries to remember what he likes himself, but it's somehow lost in the electric feeling of a finger that's now circling his anus, light and without really touching the rim.
When Sherlock doesn’t offer any reply, John looks up, and it seems to take him a moment to connect the sudden sound of the coffee grinder on the shop counter behind them with Sherlock’s silence. Once the din finally stops, Sherlock taps his toes inside his shoes to rid himself of the lingering discomfort, considering John’s question.
It's been 24 hours, and Sherlock still can't decide if he wants more or if he’s already had too much.
Clearly, not thinking has never been one of Sherlock's most cultivated talents, and so here he is, trying to repair any potential damage instead of leaving it be.
For a moment, breathing is the only thing that can be heard, and Sherlock can feel something beginning to stir in his stomach before John finally breaks the silence.
John takes a step back, tugging his hair even harder, making Sherlock almost twist in his grip before releasing him. For half a second, Sherlock sways a bit, unsteady when losing the grip on his hair after having had his head inclined for so long.
If the police had brought Sherlock in on the case earlier, when the first two murders had been connected, there wouldn’t have  been a dead man in a broom closet now, but Sherlock’s too close to eruption to even comment on this fact. It doesn’t matter. The case is solved -
His thoughts are muddled, his head is pounding and he has a queasy feeling that’s exaggerated by every shift of the train. Things are blurry for a while, but after an hour, he manages to collect himself a bit as the effect of what he’s taken continues to wear off.
His words, while hatefully disjointed, at least have the benefit of making John finally look at him.
“I fail to see what one has to do with the other,” Sherlock manages to say, surprised by the steadiness of his own voice. “It wasn't like I suggested we'd indulge in any kind of bloodplay.”
. It adds up too much more than Sherlock wants to think about at this moment, so he attempts not to think about it, attempts to focus on keeping his eyes open as he bends his head, taking the first step, for once offering to be the first one to display his vulnerability -
It’s easier like this, and it shouldn’t be. It shouldn’t be easier to shag someone simply because you can use them however you like. It shouldn’t be a turn on to grab someone by the hair and hold them still. There are so many things that shouldn’t be, but still are.
“You don't object to any of the rest of it, then?” Sherlock says, trying not to look too pleased as his words clearly had the intended effect; confirming part of John's motivation and also making John feel a bit... protective on Sherlock's behalf.
? - is set aside in favor of an irritable approach towards his brother’s intervention. At this moment, however, Sherlock doesn’t reflect on such trivialities. The humiliation, the debilitating pressure behind his sternum and the unwanted thoughts and patterns leave no room for any further irrational and useless reflections. It only leaves Sherlock in all his irrationality, his unwashed, crumpled sheets and serotonin-related misery, in full view of the immaculate man by his bedside.
It seems I'm currently shite at responding to things, mostly since I'm all wrapped up in my own head at the moment, and for that, I'm sorry.
John’s lips has left his, and now John’s voice breaks the thread of Sherlock’s thoughts and makes something turn in his stomach.
Observing his own reactions after having been exposed to something novel is part of the appeal of any new sensations, because while sensations might often turn out to be painful, upsetting, distasteful or simply disappointing, they are always useful in terms of offering him new reactions to catalogue and analyse.
An important aspect of self-destructive behavior is the inability to handle the stress stemming from an individual's lack of self-confidence - for example in a relationship, whether the other person is truly faithful ("how can they love someone like me?"); at work or school, whether the realization of assignments and deadlines is possible ("there is no way I can complete all my work on time"). Self-destructive people usually lack healthier coping mechanisms, like asserting personal boundaries. As a result, they tend to feel that showing they are incompetent is the only way to untangle themselves from demands. Successful individuals may self-destructively sabotage their own achievements; this may stem from a feeling of anxiety, unworthiness, or from an impulsive desire to repeat the "climb to the top."
And Sherlock might be an excellent observer, but at times he fails to observe the difference between an imaginary experience and a real one.
Helena had never been one for pity. None of the personalities which she’d employed on him had been more than superficially inclined towards any of the emotions -
John, on the other hand, tries to keep compensating for this behaviour during sex by being extra attentive to Sherlock and trying to put up with more of Sherlock’s eccentricities than usual without getting upset. That does, however, not seem to be very functional.
“As long as there are opponents, there’s a game, Sherlock. But you always prefered making up the rules yourself, so why not advance to making up the whole game? I’m just offering you a chance to play at a real table. There’s a weak link at the Portuguese embassy and while it will require a small amount of leg-work, I doubt that your current bout of ill-health would present too much of an obstacle.”
- conclusion that Sherlock isn't, in fact, suffering from depression. That fact aside, Clomipramine is hardly the first or even second line choice for treatment of depression.
With every curtain in the room drawn to close out the harsh daylight, Sherlock is lying on the sofa with his hands pressed together, creating a calming sensation. The dim, unintrusive light paired with the pressure on his palms in addition to the 20 mg of Oxazepam help to limit his now constantly elevated level of distress, allowing him a momentary respite during which he can direct his thoughts towards a recently recognised problem.
“I got a hunch. It’s just one of those things you notice - or think that you notice - that you can’t really explain, I think. And then there’s the jealousy.” Selma bit her lip and grinned, clearly enjoying this subject way too much.
“I assumed as much when you left and didn’t even bother to text for twenty-four hours,” comes John’s reply, matter-of-fact and even slightly off-hand, like Sherlock was stating something obvious. But the fact that it arrives several seconds after Sherlock spoke suggests otherwise.
John interrupts him by holding up his hand, and suddenly, Sherlock becomes aware, for the first time in minutes, of the vivid colour scheme that radiates from him.
It's just an abbreviated version of the mental list Sherlock has, but he gathers it's enough to convey the message that Sherlock is both putting effort into giving a ‘sensible’ answer and knows what he's talking about.
“You’re telling me not to say what we both know because it’ll make you furious?” Sherlock raises his eyebrows, looking down at his shorter friend in a way that can't be described as anything but ‘slightly condescending’.
“According to… a researcher,” Sherlock starts, not knowing how else to describe Helena without mentioning things like ‘psychiatric institution’, “there's an off-chance it's not
Warning; this chapter has no explicit consent, and even if they're both willing participants, neither of them attempts to get any verbal consent. I've also been told that this reads less than consensual because of the nature of both of their reactions and thoughts. See end notes for my own rationale behind this.
Grabbing the chair next to him, Sherlock moves quickly towards the attacker, but before he gets close enough, he sees the glint of a gun in the hand of the man on the floor, and everything goes still.
The boy answers the questions the way that someone who has had to repeat the same story over and over again often finds themselves doing. Still, Sherlock finds that there’s something about the answers that is too well thought through. It’s too neutral and objective to come from a 14-year old boy with ill-fitting street clothes and badly spiked hair, and pushing his questions even further, Sherlock manages to get the answer - or lack of answer - that proves that he’s on the right track.
As long as Sherlock is not looking he will remain unaware of what John is currently radiating. Until he opens his eyes he won't know if the colours still pulse or if it they’ve slowed down to a steady, languid rhythm the way their both of their heart rates have done by now.
“I thought I might… become a bit distracted. I thought that the combination of withdrawal and distraction would prove--”
It does itch, the need to correct, and for a second, there's a flare of something sharp and corrosive inside Sherlock, but he swallows the anger down. It's a weakness, letting emotional urges get in the way of pointing out lapses in logic, and he seldom does this -
A moment’s hesitation, but Mycroft’s expression is not nearly as pitying as it would have been if he’d known what problem Sherlock was truly turning over in his mind as he interrupted, and suddenly it’s vital not to let on.
John's torso is against his now, but Sherlock is angling the lower part of his body away slightly, because erectile tissue is very responsive, and he wonders if it's too soon for erections to enter into this.
This notion hits Sherlock about the same time as he feels the burn of a second finger pushing through his anal sphincter. Anal penetration could either be seen as the ultimate homosexual act or it could actually be seen as the act most resembling that of heterosexual penetrative sex, at least for the person who’s penetrating the other. With this new perspective it’s suddenly a bit easier to let it happen, to let John do this. Because it suddenly makes sense for John to want this as well, not just indulge Sherlock in his… homosexuality?
John hadn't heard the door open. Perhaps he hadn't properly closed it. There really was no need, since Sherlock always knew when John was in there anyway. When Sherlock feels like barging in and start asking absurd questions, the bathroom door being demonstratively shut has never seemed to prevent him from doing so.
Sherlock opens the door, stopping in the doorway and watching John. John sits on his bed, his laptop on a pillow on his lap. He looks just as neutral and unreadable as he did two hours earlier and Sherlock finds this stressful. Unpleasant expressions are somehow preferable to unreadable ones. Certainty is always better.
The pain in his nipple returns, and the sounds he make might be both needy and slightly helpless. John shouldn’t want this, but he says he does, and Sherlock’s denied John too many things to deny him this. Even if it’s Not Good. Being in love is miserable, he concludes, because he’s probably been in love for a long time, and it’s led to all of this cognitive dissonance; all this distress over how the ideas and values he holds are now contradicting themselves on a daily basis. And it’s downright miserable and too addictive to give up.
. It is important that John doesn’t notice any discomfort; he’s been hesitant enough about going to a crime scene after the past five days. The previous day was pleasantly free from vomit, but Sherlock’s stomach still isn’t in favor of any solid foods. He hid this fact from John by accepting some offered toast and then binning it as John left the room to fetch his phone -
Twisting the nipple, the images in his head shift. Fragments of his old masturbatory fantasies blend with newer ones of hands travelling further and of the pain from his nipple being the result of a brutally eager mouth. That's all it takes before Sherlock feels that his body is fully responding to the stimulus, blood filling up the erectile tissue in both nipples and genitals simultaneously.
John has been gone for sixteen minutes, and Sherlock has not given him more than a sliver of thought. The distortion inside of him efficiently blocks out such trivial topics as what happened in the kitchen and how to interpret it.
“Sensation seeker?” John echoes. “You really expect me to believe that anything that concerns you is that simple and straightforward?”
A minute later, one of the many things Sherlock cannot have gives up a sigh, shifts uncomfortably and then returns back to his room.
John finally breathes after what might have been the longest cohesive exposition he’d held for months, at least on topics other than public transport or hypochondriac patients. He must have been awake for quite some time putting together arguments and insults in a way Sherlock knows that he usually does before he delivers his stated opinion on matters that might be uncomfortable for everyone involved. Usually these opinions aren’t about Sherlock, because John is rather comfortable with grumbling with him whenever he sees a reason. They usually involve authorities, co workers (other than Sherlock) or that one incompetent bank employee that John finds unbearable enough to report to the manager, after the way he’d treated a woman in the line before John a few months ago. But today, Sherlock’s the topic of John’s exposition, and he doesn’t know if he ought to feel special or degraded by this fact.
In the midst of sensations, of bodies pressing against one another and the pain of having the edge of a doorframe pressed into his back, Sherlock loses all conscious focus on the movements of his mouth. The kissing becomes more instinctive as his attention is instead directed toward the sensation of a hand roaming over his back, and then the kissing stops all together as John’s mouth leaves Sherlock’s to trace down Sherlock’s neck, leaving a trail of rapidly cooling saliva behind and causing shivers as teeth scrape lightly against warm skin.
This is not what Mycroft had intended when he brought Sherlock the pills. A victory of sorts, but it doesn’t quite feel like a feat right now, because Sherlock is wrapping his dressing gown tighter around himself as he curls up on the sofa, the leather bitingly cold against his bare feet, and he’s not counting anything, just registering and moving.
From the corner of his eye, John glances at Sherlock, who is radiating frustration in a low-key way that means that he's trying not to sulk. He will do that occasionally these days; attempts to regulate at least some parts of his mood.
Sherlock's watched John leave before, watched him from this exact spot, and the next time he saw him after that, his mind had gotten things mixed up, for a moment mistaking John for the Moriarty he was yet to meet.
If his capacities are not restored, the conclusion must either be 1) that his brain is still adjusting to the neurochemical changes and another, later, re-test is in order, or 2) that he has further reduced his cognitive abilities by adding increased symptoms of psychopathology without the positive side-effect of likewise increased executive functioning.
His own motivation is plain enough, even to himself; he’s postponing the reflux of greyness case by case, day by day.
And yet, it's an act, because it's measured and planned, calculated to make John feel like he's glimpsed something Sherlock had attempted to hide or tried to repress.
Sherlock knows that the sensations he’s experiencing are usually labeled ‘anxiety’, but he’s never been able to relate to that word. What he experiences is a surge in his body, increased heart rate, tremors, extreme discomfort in his own skin and irrational, desperate thoughts that he’s unable to divert. Anxiety doesn’t even begin to cover it.
Effort - Throughout the whole time at the Yard, Sherlock feels like his brain is heavy and slow, the way you feel when you’re about to sleep. It’s common, especially in the ADHD spectrum of executive dysfunction, that the individual has a hard time regulating alertness and wakefulness, and one of the strongest theories about this is due to a dopamine deficiency in the brains of those with ADHD. Dopamine isn’t just responsible for our reward system (the thing that makes winning a game feel good or makes us feel content after finishing a task), which is also said to be impaired in those with ADHD (which makes it so that they need stronger stimuli in order to activate the reward system) but also plays an important role in regulating the level of alertness in our brains. In short, some researchers believe that a lot of the symptoms we see of ADHD is due to the brain constantly being on the verge of falling asleep, and the fidgeting, restlessness, daydreaming and so on are different coping mechanisms to keep awake. It would also explain part of the impulsivity and the impairment in emotional regulation, as anyone who’s been really, really tired can certainly testify to.
It's so easy, now that he's found the solution. It won't fix the problem, but it does make it bearable, perhaps even enjoyable.
John breaks the kiss, breathing too hard, the last moments of the kiss have been more pressing of open mouths against each other than actual kissing. And as Sherlock feels how his sphincter slowly relaxes, John presses a bit further, than halts at the pressure that once again increases. Sherlock wonders if he ought to stop stroking John, if John wants to… in him? But that doesn’t make sense, because John isn't gay, and anal penetration with another man is a rather homosexual act. Even Sherlock knows this, and he’s not that ajour with contemporary sexuality. The thought and the contradiction in this is distressing, because even if there’s no genitals involved, John’s still penetrating him, and Sherlock can’t see why John would want to, because John’s admitted that the fact that Sherlock’s a man is somewhat new and a bit uncomfortable to him, and Sherlock hates that, hates the thought of John being uncomfortable. The most confusing thing, however, is the fact that John initiated this, that John breathes hard and seems to take some form of pleasure from penetrating an anus with his finger. It doesn’t make sense, but it feels sensical. No, it doesn’t; it feels intense, insane, invasive, incredible....
- as he fumbles for his phone, briefly turning on the flashlight to illuminate the narrow road before putting the phone away, saving the battery.
It wasn't only the details of the current case that had led him to the conclusion that Sophia wasn't missing, but hiding. There had been other cases, cases that hadn't been his but that he'd read about in the papers and routinely stored away in his Mind Palace for reference. But he hadn't been able to access those articles, because entering his Mind Palace meant entering a place where memories were kept, and there were things there that he needed not to remember in too much detail right now. Patterns that could reconnect in his brain once more, replacing what little logic he had left with more delusional obsessions.
Sherlock doesn’t, however, protest. He just lies there, something vile and hateful prickling his eyes and it might be anger or self-loathing or shame or resentment, but Sherlock only knows that it’s hateful and intense and that it’s John’s fault - or maybe it’s his? - and that this was never a good idea to begin with.
Straightening further in his armchair, Mycroft brushes some invisible lint from his jacket, adjusting it before looking at Sherlock with an expression that surely has been perfected during hundreds of meetings with government officials. The thinly veiled scepticism cuts sharp as he speaks.
From now on, trigger warnings for intrusive thoughts which might be of a violent or otherwise disturbing nature may apply, as do trigger warnings for depressive thoughts/behavior.
) need and only allow himself to give in on a few, well-chosen instances, and now he ought to know better than to embark on external solutions to internal problems, but yet he’s here; doing it once again. There’s chaos inside his mind and new obsessions threatening to override all the previous ones (
(And he is rich, comparatively, and he's white and he’s male, but he wants to tell this woman that he's more than that. A freak. Neuroatypical. Gay. Addicted. Mentally ill. Defective. These are things you can hide more or less successfully when you're a rich, white male, but they're still things that define his every waking minute some days.)
There are more words, but they’re spoken in such a way as to make them indistinguishable. Sherlock backs away, hiding himself further along the hallway before Mycroft opens the door to go down the stairs.
On the other side of the wall, John is bumping the toaster against the microwave as he wipes the kitchen counter. Normal sounds. Not the silence of an empty flat.
In the midst of the lingering confusion of the entire, unexpected ordeal, it’s a slight comfort to know that he still knows what it takes to get John’s recently discovered… ‘dominant tendencies’ to set in.
John’s voice comes from where he’s still hunched on the floor, looking up at Sherlock with patience, awaiting further explanations.
“I don't want to know!” Lestrade says, putting up his hands as if to shield himself from finding out yet another thing he’d be theoretically obliged to arrest them for.
(Better his right than his left - the left is for working the violin strings - so at least he’d had enough presence of mind to ensure that it was the right hand. The
Hidden under all the possible implications of John’s words lies a fact that Sherlock’s been long been aware of but that he’s never found relevant to examine more closely; the fact that John is not as straight as he himself would like to believe. It had been a simple deduction, one Sherlock had made within the first few days of their companionship, based on seemingly trivial observations of John’s more or less subconscious behaviours. It doesn't matter, because whether or not John has any bisexual tendencies, it's clear to Sherlock that they are either deeply repressed, subconscious or something he's made a conscious decision not to act upon. It hadn't seemed important at the time, but given recent events, it'll be something that Sherlock will need to take into account.
“No, you didn’t,” John says with a snort, apparently further amused by this. “Nope. I think even my mediocre powers of observation would allow me to notice if you’d somehow fallen asleep mid-conversation. In fact, you sounded rather put out by the whole orange thing.”
So far, this particular come down has been relatively mild, with no sensations of ants crawling under his skin, no arrhythmia nor any immediately overhanging threats of serious repercussions of any sort. In fact, this come down seems almost negligible so far compared to some of the others he’s experienced during his life.
John rubs his hands over his arms, trying to keep some warmth in his body in the freezing January night. Sherlock, on the other hand, doesn't even seem to notice the cold, sitting there like some kind of statue next to John on the bench.
As Sherlock leaves rehab for the second time, it is with only one diagnosis: F19.23 - Other psychoactive substance dependence with withdrawal. Sherlock finds that, as far as validity goes, he has no objections to said diagnosis, given the the psychical and psychological symptoms he's had the misfortune of experiencing during his stay.
Having John holding him still while towering over him and invading (there’s no other word, it’s a war of sorts) his mouth is unexpected. Sherlock loves unexpected things. And the way John takes control gives Sherlock almost complete discharge from liability.
For once, Sherlock's giving John time to protest. Time to turn his head away, to deflect, to laugh nervously and disentangle himself from this.
Sherlock was frustrated. The endorphins produced by physical stimulation and the orgasm that followed offered a certain level of respite. Endorphins might do the trick for John as well.
John hasn’t knocked on his door. John hasn’t come to him with questions. John hasn’t asked him to explain, or to provide assurances that this is  in fact one of Mycroft’s jokes at Sherlock’s expense, and of course the great detective does not need psychotropic drugs in order not to be…
There's a hint of uncertainty - of protest - in John's features, but it dies away as John takes in the intent and the excitement in Sherlock's eyes.
An average man, at least physically, if one didn't take the shattered scapula and the scar tissue of his shoulder into account. Deceivingly average. And yet.
Political games were always more Mycroft’s cup of tea than Sherlock’s - too dry and clinical, and Sherlock prefers to observe the mess that people make in their own lives rather than the mess caused by lobbying, bribes and governmental scheming. It makes his own structural distortions fade in comparison.
There’s definitely tension in the air, almost as visible as the colors that surround them. But John doesn’t move, doesn’t take a step towards Sherlock, and Sherlock isn’t sure if this is his cue or if he’s been too vague in his invitation a few seconds ago, and John simply doesn’t get it.
“You’ve read all these?” John asks and nods at the seemingly endless supply of haphazardly placed books that already covers most surfaces in 221B.
Sherlock knows this is not the solution to his problems with living. He wishes that he was naive enough to actually believe that it is, but that kind of rationalisation - or rather self-delusion - is not something his intellect will allow, not even after the cocaine crosses over the blood-brain barrier and things become far more… agreeable. Drugs are, however, effective when it comes to making those problems seem irrelevant. When Sherlock is high, the world is seldom dull.
, that very first night, to keep me at a convenient distance at all times. And you just keep doing these things, all of them. I can barely hold on to my job, never mind a woman. Because you invade everything, rummage around for a few minutes and you don’t even bother to clean up when you go, not even closing the door behind you. And now
In life, we all do this on some level. Food, sex, drugs (prescription or other), shopping, games, porn, nicotine... only to mention a few ways. We all do it, but for some, there are worse consequences than for others, some of it might depend on the seriousness of the problem one is trying to self-medicate for. In Sherlock's case, it's most of his being he's trying to medicate away (more or less consciously), and then a traumatic emotional event on top of that. Not 'problems' that are likely to solve themselves and make self-medication superfluous.
He gave the older man an anxious smile and was about to say something when Greg raised his hand and stopped him.
Unfortunately the rain came down in buckets as they crossed the swimming pond area, in the sunken courtyard surrounded by the rose bushes. While skipping past the lotus leaves on the water, splattered by the falling raindrops, Sherlock thought for a moment he saw something.
“Hey,” Greg sounded unusually stern, he raised his arm, “Wait a moment. I did this for a purpose. First and foremost, they deserve to know. They are family, it’s about their brothers too, we are not supposed to keep them in the dark. As for this situation and what Mrs. Holmes and Mrs. Moriarty said, we have to help them. Let’s make one effort, please, then we can think of other measures.”
John will take a while to be easy with this relationship but he won't have any issues continuing the conjugal life with his housemate. Go figure!
“I guess your work ethic is something I need to learn from,” the older man said, “Because my final decision has something to do with my work, as a surgeon. So, I intend to work as a surgeon for the rest of my life. I have trustworthy people like Mary, Mike, Greg and Mycroft to look after my assets, investments and contracts. The money will keep growing, the charities will continue to prosper and John Watson will have no role to play in this aside from a monthly check of the accounts and other papers.”
“What’s wrong with you,” Sherlock licked at the sore spot and went to a mirror to check. Shit, John would most definitely notice. In the mirror he saw Jim grinning and turned to face him, “What the hell is wrong with you, asshole?”
Molly answered the door at that point, pale as a sheet and shaking and trembling all over. Irene quickly threw her robe over her frail shoulders and went into the room and switched on the lights. As Molly clung to Anthea and began to weep, a fearless Mrs. Hudson went to straight to the windows and checked outside, flashing her torch light into the garden area there and the neighboring cottage. “Did you have a nightmare or did you see something outside?” She asked.
John answered the door, his T shirt still stuck half way between his head and shoulders. “What’s the matter? Is your guy still asleep? Mine’s still in bed and we were having a romantic moment so this better be something important.”
“Jimmy you need to look at me, hold my gaze, hold my hands and breathe with me. Just breathe, please!”
, but now he is even worse that that, he’s a slimmed down bigger bastard in an expensive three-piece suit and signature tie.”
Greg shrugged, “As I said, the car will be fine. We could have transported it but you insisted that it should be right before your eyes all the time, hence someone had to drive it. I could have let you drive it too but right now your life and wellbeing is a bit too precious. The last thing I wanted was any silly accident on the way….. alright, just to put some context, if you have an emotional attachment to the car then I understand. Otherwise, if it’s purely for utility purposes of taking you from one place to the other, I think you can very well afford to lose this one and buy a better one. You have a hundred grand in the bank, already.”
Mrs. Marlene Patterson lived at the edge of the town, by the riverside, with her two cats and one dog, a Tibetan mastiff. Her house was a bit secluded, with giant trees on both sides and a series of boulders behind, some open space around it which was too rugged to be used for a walkway. So she usually got a lot of privacy, except for two neighboring houses which stood about three hundred meters away on top of a hillock where the land ended. After that there was the river and beyond it was the bridge. One could see the bridge from a distance and hear the sounds of trains that chugged past.
“Yes, we should go and see her, I haven’t seen her yet,” he said with ample regret in his voice, “Thanks for reminding me about my duties. Sometimes I do tend to behave like mum, just put myself on centerstage and not look at all the bystanders who deserve to be there…. Harry, Harry I am sorry. Whatever you saw, I am sorry, you should have never seen me like that, I should have never done that, I am sorry….” He took her arm, noticing that she seemed relieved and happy at his reaction, “Come on, we must go and pay our respects to nana….. oh, by the way, did Mike write to you about coming over today? We were supposed to meet tomorrow, weren’t we?”
Mary exhaled slowly, “I know. She was a good person. Very fair, generous and intelligent. A very strong woman with a remarkable zest of life and a dry sense of humor. I am so sorry.”
In five minutes he was out through the window and downstairs, fully dressed and eyes glowing like hot coals in the dark. He pushed the motorcycle all the way to the edge of the village with amazing speed and strength where he knew his friend would be waiting for him.
Lady Elizabeth Smallwood appeared, elegantly dressed and armed with a smile. “And this must be Sherlock!” She seemed impressed, “Now that’s a very handsome young man! So tall! John you have to start putting some extra padding in your shoes from now on, huh?”
“I know young dudes in their teens and early twenties do bunk down together but a roommate situation at my age? No man shares a room at this point in their lives, unless it’s a brother or they are…..”
Both men remembered the words said by the panic-stricken man who had visited them with all good intentions. How they wished they had the opportunity to speak to him at length, to save him maybe. But even though he was no longer around, his words came back easily to them, clear as crystal. ‘The only way you can be safe is if you find love amidst the evil that surrounds us…’ He had also said something on the lines of ‘You must call out with all the love in your heart.’ Yes, that was what they had said and John remembered it now, he remembered it all too well. Sebastian too, as he interpreted the real meaning behind those words of caution and wisdom. “We should do that,” he said determinedly, “To save everyone.”
Greg smiled broadly and shook his head, “No, I don’t think anything needs to change for us. We haven’t taken the next step for a good reason.” When Mycroft gave him a slightly baffled look he added gently, “Look, things are all fine just the way they are between us right now. We have busy careers and we love our independence and lifestyle. My work takes me to a few other countries and I maintain residence at Paris as well while you love your London, your work and your social life here. Still, we are always there for each other, meet once a month and speak every day. Why does that have to change? Really, I am very happy the way we are Myc, I don’t expect anything more.”
“I am. But sympathy doesn’t equal to putting him in the position of Sherlock’s partner. Don’t you see, Sherlock is getting personally attached to this man. It’s no longer a matter of kindness or charity or helping someone in need. This is about being close to someone one is….. whom one is sexually attracted to. This is different. Such feelings make a person vulnerable and their judgment gets a bit impaired.”
“Excuse me,” another nurse came up, she was a new one and a temporary resource, “Mary you are needed upstairs at the lab, immediately.”
“You know I wouldn’t flatter, lie or fake it. I’d rather help you look the way she prefers… or is used to. But you look really gorgeous! Effortlessly gorgeous! I can already hear her telling me ‘You got real lucky son, careful, don’t lose this one’. She might be old but she’s quite stable, she has her wits around her even today. When you meet her, I swear you’ll think for a moment that she’s fifty, not ninety one.”
The feast was magnificent and the table groaned under the weight of Turducken, lobster, seabass, caviar, truffles, the best of cheeses and cold cuts, vol au vents, salads, pastas, steaks of the finest cuts and crepes. There was also champagne, whiskey, white and red wine and lots of mulled wine and eggnog to go with the food. Candles flickered everywhere, a private orchestra had been hired to play for them, guests showed up in all their finery and Sherlock was introduced to John’s limited circle of friends and associates, with much pride, joy and fanfare.
Then there were a couple of minor royals and their partners, looking for wealthy associates to fund their opulent lifestyles and drying coffers. They weren’t meeting with much success, if their expressions were anything to go by. Irene’s butler seemed to be a former henchman and wouldn’t mind grabbing a piece of good fortune in the shape of an engagement ring. He was clearly overworked and under-appreciated and under-paid as well. Irene’s assistant had elevated herself to her place, a mistress rather than a secretary, by marrying some sheikh. The sheikh was a total debauch and for sure used Irene’s contacts to get some underaged boys and girls into his bed.
“STOP IT NOW,” John yelled, “This is insane!!!” Almost immediately someone groaned, a nurse came around and asked him to keep it down and they also heard a curse from the next room. A quick peek into Sherlock’s room showed him asleep though.
“Not at all. But don’t believe me yet. Go through the employment contract with a fine tooth comb and only then you can believe me. I am sure you would.”
Greg Lestrade had recovered somewhat by then and managed to take the reins of the conversation back in his hands. “Thank you for your time Sherlock,” he said, “Please do tell us exactly how things happened on that stormy night. I know you must have said this several times and it’s become quite boring but……”
“Sure thing gran,” Sherlock did exactly as he was asked to and found she was truly stronger than he thought. Without too much of a wobble she crossed the distance between the path and the bench, walking barefoot on the grass with a blissful expression on her face. He helped her sit down and took a seat beside her. “I hear woodpeckers, thrushes, canaries,” she murmured, “This garden is a zen garden Sherlock. I designed it myself, some thirty years ago. Once I am gone, promise me you will maintain it exactly like this.”
John might be able to withstand far more than any sane man ever would in this - whatever this is - but having to watch the man he’s perhaps in some kind of sexual or romantic entanglement with putting on deoderant and brush his teeth is apparently where John draws the line.
Because in this, John is a natural leader, a pathmaker, and Sherlock is an overwhelmed child in a candy shop, too excited and filled with cravings to know where to begin and how to portion out his indulgence. And Sherlock is very rarely a follower, but in this he allows himself to be just that.
Sherlock minutely shakes his head, ridding it of images that doesn't belong in this room, in this context.
If Sherlock is not sure that this is the right, or the Right, thing to do, then he’s at least more than tired of making John doubt himself.
It's tempting to allow himself to speed up until his words come out in an incomprehensible stream, but Sherlock has promised himself to do this properly. He’s unlikely to cause more damage than his behaviour over the past few days already has done.
The thought of flying seems to be something that others connect with possibilities, and Sherlock now sees why.
“You know what? I’m too tired to even think about this right now,” John finally says, closing the fridge and instead grabbing an apple from a bowl by the cooker. “You can’t just-- no. Let's just have this talk some time when I haven't been awake for twenty-four hours straight.”
John assured her that it was, and left her smiling as he made his way through the pub. When he returned with their second round she looked inquiringly at him, but resumed the previous topic for a while, now with a more actively listening John. They’d made it to their third drink when she once again got that look on her face, and now she spoke.
Judging by the level of unpleasant sensations and increased anxiety, especially during the first two days, Sherlock has to admit that a certain degree of withdrawal
Sherlock has stopped laughing. Instead, his eyes find the tiny window that faces an identical block of flats and thinks about how birds don’t understand the concept of glass.
- but the tightness around Sherlock’s chest eased within minutes of taking the two pills. It’s not pharmacokinetically possible for the pills to have an effect before they have a chance to dissolve and be taken up into his bloodstream, and even then it will take a while for the chemicals to reach the concentration needed in order to have any significant influence. Yet Sherlock found the effect to be almost instantaneous.
“I must say, your friend is certainly less predictable than most. Embarking on this kind of… entanglement. But then he never was one for self-preservation.”
Resting his cheek against Sherlock’s bony shoulder blade John finds himself almost completely at ease with it all.
There’s so much self-destructive behavior in this fic that I could probably write an essay; but I’ll settle for this for now.
Finding himself bereft of John's mouth for a second, Sherlock has time to panic before John is pushing him back a bit, until his shoulders hit the wall behind him, steadying them both. Then, after a quick meeting of their eyes, the wet-warm pressure is back, and John is pushing into his mouth, fingers pulling slightly at Sherlock's hair and what Sherlock saw in those eyes before the kissing resumed--
It’s a decision made almost intuitively, and the words comes out of his mind almost before Sherlock is aware of having made the decision.
This is a rush of blood through his body, a sensation so strong that the doubts in the back of his head are tuned down to an acceptable level. He likes this. John Watson likes giving Sherlock more than he thought that his friend would ever accept, and he likes watching Sherlock struggle to take what’s given. Squirming as John gives his hair a harsh tug and suppressing his reflex to push John away as the pain in his nipple must surely be more intense than what could be perceived as pleasurable by any means.
“It is what’s going to happen, but that’s irrelevant to what you’re implying,” Sherlock lied, voice now sharpened by surprise. He hadn’t thought John would be level-headed enough after the exchange of words last night to even attempt to find a reason behind the words except for the undeniable fact that Sherlock was just as inhuman as John himself had so accurately stated at the time.
A psychiatric side-note; It should be mentioned that what Sherlock experiences with the tapping, the pressure and what he perceives as external compulsions isn't quite that easily categorised. At this point, I'd say that it's a mix of compulsions (which is something you do to reduce the discomfort of an obsessive thought), a stim (a behaviour which is self-calming/self-stimulating regardless, but in this case it might be prompted by an obsession) and a tic (an involuntary movement or gesture that you feel a pressure/urge to perform). I just want to clarify that some of what Sherlock regards as part of his OCD might have a different - or mixed - origin, which is only natural, given the high rate of comorbidity between the thing he never let anyone diagnose, OCD and other neurodiversities, and nothing in this story should therefore be regarded as purely symptoms of his OCD (which in this story doesn't manifest itself in any of the more common ways, but that's covered in another A/N, so let's get on with the story…).
As they cross the street, their flat becomes visible. Inside the flat, the lights are on and everything that had looked like a promise of something that would counteract the soreness in his throat and the greyness that has not in fact been kept at bay at all, but rather been managed simply by Sherlock provoking and heightening this… game of theirs, upping it until the crackling of it became loud enough to drown out the noise floor that had slowly begun to gain a foothold in his mind.
A few heartbeats pass by, then there's a squeeze from Sherlock's hand, before said hand slowly pulls away from John's.
After three and a half hours of Sherlock not destroying property or seriously insulting John, but instead seemingly pulling himself apart from the inside from the look of it, John has had enough and goes up to his room. He brings his laptop and Sherlock’s headphones with him as he goes.
He stared at her for a few seconds, noticing that she had started to feel a bit uncomfortable, but not looking away. Sherlock had begun to look away more and more frequently.
The usher nods and retreats back into the corridor, silently closing the door behind him as Sherlock takes a seat opposite Mycroft, careful to keep his expression neutral and the brief tapping of his fingers obscured by his folded arms.
John doesn’t smile, he only keeps looking intensely at Sherlock, like he’s trying to put the pieces together.
“Don't break your toys. I know it's not intentional, just like it wasn’t that time with the model railway… but you will always ignore the safety instructions.”
No. The pressure seems to fluctuate constantly and uncontrollably and it's appalling, because Sherlock knows that this is not real. He should be able to override these patterns and Not Right feelings. This time he's prepared for them, but still they seem to be taking him by surprise.
The problem is in itself a cause for distress. Reviewing his own reactions to John during the last 20 hours Sherlock can observe tendencies that would indicate certain physical and emotional responses consistent with a very specific sentiment.
At times, when there’s no case on and nothing to occupy himself with, Sherlock will do it to himself. Will lock the door to his bedroom quietly, knowing that John’s asleep or away but still being cautious. He’ll pinch his own nipples, clamp them, will slap his own skin and pretend that it’s someone else’s hand. With his hand on his cock, he’ll writhe from the mixed signals of pain and arousal and when he comes, the two sensations will be so merged together that he can no longer tell them apart.
Sherlock still can't answer that, no one can, and he does not know if he still believes in the God he thought would end the world, but if he does, it's an involuntary belief. No one can save him, and he knows this now.
It's a polite, common question. It still causes John freeze up for a second, not knowing what kind of answer he can expect from Sherlock, or if Sherlock will even bother to acknowledge the question. Usually, John wouldn’t care much, but this is his job, his colleagues and his world away from Sherlock and the madness of their life. This is his, and Sherlock could probably ruin what John's built up for himself with just a few words, as is his talent.
once again filling him with a sense of control, of being where he’s supposed to be. John’s limp had once again vanished and he was smiling as he rolled his eyes at Lestrade when he thought Sherlock was being a git.
He could ask. He’s asked about these things before. Awkwardly and almost incoherent, yes, but he’d asked. At this point he finds himself unwilling to. There are some things that you simply shouldn’t ask about.
No one believes Sherlock, and Sherlock is powerless, because he's twelve years old and everything hurts so fucking bad.
Lying besides John on their kitchen table, Sherlock's is struggling to regain control over his own breathing.
His fingers close awkwardly around the part of John’s cock that he can now reach. John's jeans are unzipped and his hand is under the elastic of John’s pants. John doesn’t seem to appreciate the awkward angle either, because his hand leaves Sherlock and quickly pushes his jeans and pants down to his thighs before he returns to Sherlock’s skin, once again feeling the fading, white lines of scar tissue that makes the skin feel a bit like it was lined with thick threads.
The symptoms are usually dramatic, happen “overnight and out of the blue,” and can include motor and/or vocal tics, obsessions, and/or compulsions. In addition to these symptoms, children may also become moody or irritable, experience anxiety attacks, or show concerns about separating from parents or loved ones.
John will feel reassured by the fact that Sherlock ingests tea, and that’s just what Sherlock needs, since Lestrade has been inquiring about a case that the Met might need his assistance on if they can’t solve it before tomorrow.
The strain in John’s voice, the voice he uses when he's so close to the edge of losing control, makes the decision easy.
Four hours ago, in his bedroom; John's questions, his insistence on checking on Sherlock. At Speedy's, working on the case.
His gaze catches on the white and yellow box just before he closes the drawer of his night table, having returned the lubricant to its place in the back.
- and Sherlock is pacing on the already threadbare parts of the warmly red carpet covering the stained wooden floor. John doesn’t need to see Sherlock display the evidence of his mental dysfunctions and Sherlock doesn’t need to watch John trying to hide-- whatever reaction he would be likely to hide behind soldier-like equanimity.
(This is a kind of problem Sherlock’s avoided until now. He’s not sure he likes this new kind of problem, but he’s determined to see things through. He will be consistent in this. He will be consistent for John. For himself.)
Considering the time he's wasted doing illogical things - a result of his current low levels of the neurotransmitter in question - lately, it only seems rational that he would make up for it by kick-starting his brain back into efficiency.
It’s almost 2 am, the party that had been thrown together by the medical students at one of the smaller clubs down by Cherwell is reaching its peak at the exact same time as John is reaching his limit.
(He wasted time, last night, time he could have spent working, not struggling pathetically against his own urges - and now that’s yet another fine pattern, isn’t it?)
. It’s childish, but one tends to regress when one is frequently hunched over a toilet, spilling out whatever amount of liquid that still remains in one’s body.
Sherlock - radiating annoyance at the whole situation - shakes his head in an almost invisible gesture. Eva looks like she's going to attempt at persuade him, but John aborts that attempt.
Mycroft is occupying an armchair in one of the few rooms of the club where conversation is allowed. He looks up from the sleek laptop perched on his knees as the door opens.
“I just told him the reckless git he asked to consult on the case had used his massive intellect and his degree in chemistry to conduct experiments with himself as a test subject. Experiments that anyone with any knowledge of toxicology could have told him would - with no uncertainty - incapacitate the test subject for a while. But Sherlock Holmes doesn’t consult anyone on his experiments, not even the obvious candidate; the medical doctor he shares a flat with. Therefore, Sherlock Holmes is currently trying to avoid his friend and throwing up bile instead of being out in Camden, deducing strangulation marks in a double murder. Bummer, right?”
“This is all the information we have on known connections between the parties involved in the disappearances. I trust you will dispose of the contents once you have everything you need.”
Sherlock might be combusting from the pressure, but doesn’t let it show on the outside. He can take the panic -
If it had been any of the people John had dated in the past, he would have known the protocol for this kind of thing.
