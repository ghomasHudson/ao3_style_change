“All right,” Cas murmured quietly, as if he were soothing animals, not flesh and blood men, “I think we just all need to cool it, all right?”
“Of course not. I was merely worried when we couldn’t find you,” He said, quietly, but loud enough for Dean to hear clearly.
Cas was pulled from the swirling tide of his thoughts by the arrival of Dean with a closed box. The scents of garlic, lime, and something floral and herby came to Cas’s nose, and he looked up.
Both men, much to Cas’s surprise, fell silent at his inquiry. The silence felt pregnant, loaded, explosive like a bomb. They drove back to the bus, and Wilkes gently tapped the back of Cas’s seat. Silently, Cas got out of the car, and Wilkes pushed past him, muttering about pay raises and crybaby superstars.
But that had been before he’d known Mary’s origins, before Azazel became interested in their family and Sam leading his ‘piss-poor demon army’.
“Thank you, but no,” He whispered, though he cupped her ass and squeezed. She groaned, grinding against his hand. “That’s not very nice, Winchester...”
Chapter five of my smutty Supernatural AU fic, Jealous, is now officially live! Castiel begins to realize the depth of his feelings for his charge, Dean. What will happen next? Read on to find out!
Castiel had been unable to resist following them, though he had not been chosen as the angel who watched over the boys. Despite himself, he’d still been drawn to them; for years, they’d been his North Star, his guiding lights. Reading novels had infused him with a romanticism that was now impossible to shake.
Not that word. It had only come up a handful of times in his youth, from a few partners, or more accurately, playmates. He had thought, for a while, that his heart lay with Cassie back in Ohio, back when he was young and had no concept of what true pain, fear, and loss was.
Wilkes had wanted to hire a man to remove the sexual temptation for Dean, but he hadn’t expected him to shut down entirely. Though he could be abrasive at times, he had inherited John’s signature charm; in fact, Wilkes had tried to recruit their father for the rock star track, but John had laughed. No, he’d said, he was a family man, and he adored his beautiful wife Mary and his growing sons. He fully intended to settle down with his family, the white picket fence and a dog, the whole nine yards.
“Hey, I gotta get going, okay? You need to get up,” Dean whispered, kissing her temple. He might have played at being a gruff asshole, and he might have been a rock star, but he appreciated her pleasuring him.
Fumbling for his phone, he grabbed it off of the bedside table, swearing. He swiped without looking.
One of the first things that Metatron had ever introduced Castiel to, pop-culture wise, was Greek mythology, and he realized that Dean looked like one of those illustrations out of the old books the scribe favored, all dark, smoldering eyes, ample lips, and gorgeous, taut muscles, a god exiled to the Earth.
Dean had no idea where to go; he’d had no plan outside of getting Cas alone. To know that the other man had gone to bat for him in such a major way; he was almost feeling affectionate. And he barely knew the guy. This scared the hell out of him. He didn’t catch feelings. Period. End of story. He hit it and quit it, sometimes by himself, other times with help, from a friend or a girl. He’d never really acknowledged the fact that he was bi, not until Castiel had come along.
By the time they’d reached the food truck and got in line, Dean was kicking himself. Castiel was awkward enough; he didn’t need another excuse to pick at his flaws. Sam had always said that Dean’s insatiable curiosity would be the death of him, and more than once, he’d been right.
He stopped at a gas station to fill up and stock up on goodies, pretending that he’d left his ID in his other pair of pants, like he literally didn’t wear the same thing every single day. It had been unconscious, at first, but it had become an unlikely signature of his. Thanking the acne-riddled teen who was more absorbed in the grainy black and white TV opposite his post, Cas took his loot and walked out to the car, loading everything into the backseat.
And now, to know that Castiel had fought for him, for his freedom, and for Baby, the last vestige of his family. It made him realize that he could no longer avoid his attraction to his bodyguard.
The agent walked into the bus, which for the moment, was quiet. “Deany boy, I got a bone to pick with you, son,” He said mildly, holding out a beer, as if it was a peace offering.
Cas didn’t like to drive often; he didn’t know how to work human things such as motor vehicles. But he didn’t want to spook or piss off his employer; the last thing he wanted was to get off on the wrong foot with Dean fucking Winchester. Things were already sticky as it were.
“Speak up, man, I can’t hear you. You need help with all that?” Dean asked impatiently, stepping forward before Cas could reply. He gave the bags to Dean silently, and both men walked to the bus, Dean deftly kicking the door loose with one leg.
For a while, the distraction of it had worked. Performing, a different city every few days, a different girl every few hours, booze and food and alcohol all at his fingertips, always. The label had let him have an assistant, until he couldn’t help himself and he’d fucked her until she’d begged him for more. After that, his agent had taken more of a controlled, streamlined approach: keep Dean happy using any means necessary, but he handled the details and the logistics.
Dean barked out an incredulous laugh, grabbing the brew and twisting the top off with deft, calloused fingers.
Castiel wondered if he was thinking of John, Mary, and Sam; if he could still feel the souls of his family, though his parents were dead and gone. And Sam, well. Sam had made a life for himself outside of hunting, choosing to stay at Stanford and head the legend and myths department. He’d gotten married, but no children.
Before Dean was even out of the infamous Impala, Wilkes was charging across the flat dirt, his mouth screwed up in a scowl.
Hey, all. Did you miss me? I missed all of you. I want to apologize for the wait; I've been going through multiple major mental health crises. It's hard to muster up the energy to be creative and write, even when you want to. I've honestly just wanted to die the last couple of months and it's been very difficult. I'm sad, lonely, stressed, tired, stir-crazy, and fucking sick of the pandemic. I'm just so very tired. It's getting harder and harder to hold on every day. I'm tired of losing people; friends and family alike. I'm just very sad and wanted to put something out there, maybe make myself feel better. I love all of you, thank you for reading and making my dreams come true. There is romance and sexy times in this chapter, and I hope you love reading it as much as I enjoyed writing it. I love you all, kudos and comments are welcome, and thank you again!
When he sat back up, the book cradled in his hands, he found Dean pulling a young woman into his rooms at the back of the bus. His private rooms were not to be touched by anyone, not even Wilkes, for fear of getting gutted like a fish. There was a flash of long, dark hair; Dean’s face, in the brief glimpse Cas had gotten, was flushed, his eyes dark with desire.
“Perhaps we should wait until we get to the bus before an argument starts?” He asked mildly, though on the inside his nerves were jangling. He hated conflict, and always had. Yet another reason for his siblings to call him weak, malleable. They could jeer at him all they liked, but he had his honor. At the very least, that could not be called into question, despite his previous mistakes.
He said the last with a sly smile that made Dean’s heart do flipflops and his stomach knot itself into ropes.
He squirmed, and Dean’s dark, delicious laugh told him he knew exactly what was going through his mind.
Cas smiled and shook his head, but he took a taco out of the box and took a big bite. He heard Dean’s quiet laughter behind him, and he turned to look at him.
Hello, all! First of all: I'm so sorry that it's taken me this long to update. First I got overwhelmed when school started, and with the holidays, I just lost track of time. I've only recently begun to get back into writing (for both work and my fun projects) and I've missed you all so much! I hope you love this chapter, seven. Under A Candy-Painted Sky! Kudos, comments, and concrit feedback welcomed! I hope you all loved this chapter as much as I enjoyed writing it. Stay tuned, because the fun is just beginning and things are only just starting to heat up. I love you all, and thank you for reading my story! This is the third baby of my heart and I love it so much. Enjoy!
“We’ll take this back to the bus for the others. I think I owe Wilkes for that bitch fit I threw over that beer.” He sounded contrite, and it made Cas’s chest ache. He only nodded.
So, even though mostly against his will, Castiel joins Naomi in rebuilding Heaven back to its old self, and attempting to make it even better. Which, of course, isn’t that easy since most of the Angels agree that the biggest reason they even need all this work done is obviously because of Castiel. Even the Angel in question agrees to that, much to his dismay and embarrassment.
But Dean shakes his head. He doesn’t want to stay here; it’s cold, his hands are shivering from both the temperature and the fear, and he’s a literal ticking time bomb. If those two kids decide to come back, he doesn’t know what he’ll be capable of doing without having Claire to hold him back.
Little did the Winchesters know, Wilkes had dealings that went a little too far south for their tastes. But what they didn’t know wouldn’t hurt them. Not yet, anyway.
Cas blinked; he hadn’t expected Dean to be so friendly, or grateful. But before he could rethink it, he nodded.
He felt something growing stiff in his boxers, and he groaned, verbally expressing the tension in his body. Unfortunately, there was no such thing for him to do with his mind. Some days were like this, though he hadn’t one in at least a month. If he didn’t already have such a packed day planned, he’d say fuck it and stay in the bus all day, the blinds closed.
He was lost in Cass’s breaths, his pants, and when Dean looked down, he was gratified and aroused to discover that the other man’s dick was pushing at his pants, as though it wanted Dean.
With Dean’s hands wrapped in his shirt, he leaned forward and kissed the other man, practically purring.
He didn’t like admitting it, not even to himself, but he craved warmth, connection, love, and not like the fleeting affair he’d had with Cassie, either.
Dean and Cas leave the bus to grab some food and get to know each other on the way. When they return with drinks and tacos, they have a conversation, bonding over their mutual love of one of Dean's favorite books.
“Dean, you feel so good, please don’t stop, fuck me harder,” Cas cried, and Dean shuddered himself, nearly undone at the dirty language and the pleasant friction between them.
“Wilkes, it’s my fucking car, man.” Dean said coldly, driving one handed, knuckles white on the steering wheel. “It’s my dad’s car. You can’t honestly sit here and tell me that I have to impound it.”
A note on the title: I’ve been really feeling Ariana Grande’s music recently, as I come into my confidence more; so, I figured why not name a sexy chapter after ‘Positions’? I do not own the lyrics or rights to the song at all; it’s more inspiration. Enjoy! *
Dean thanks Castiel for intervening with Wilkes and helping him keep Baby. As a thank you, Dean offers to take him for a ride. As the two go on a makeshift trip (date?), Dean realizes that what he feels for Castiel can no longer be ignored. Will angel and hunter find common ground under the candy-coated sky?
“Castiel! Cas, come out here, right now!” Dean called, climbing the steps to the bus three at a time. When he came inside, he found Cas with his trenchcoat discarded, and his shirt off. His back was to Dean, and the sight of the other man’s bare skin made him go stiff in his jeans. Castiel had tattoos, a beautiful rendering of an angel’s wings in stark black ink. Below the angel’s wings, there was a beautiful scripture, though Dean couldn’t read it. He didn’t know why, but his throat was tight.
He was struck breathless when Dean’s luscious, warm lips met the head of his member. It was so warm, and soft, and gentle, and oh, God, oh Father above, his tongue. It was pure magic. And judging by Dean’s laughing, hoarse moans, he was loving giving it as much as Castiel was receiving.
“Oh, God, you’re so big, I can almost feel you in my throat,” Dean purred breathlessly, eyes lustful red slits, and Cas almost came, right there in Dean’s hand. He fucking loved it when Dean used his sexy, husky bedroom voice.
And this sudden bout of feelings for this gorgeous, mysterious man, whose eyes gleamed with secret kindness, whose hands were as gentle on a guitar’s strings as well as skin...
She woke up and smiled sleepily, running one hand down his naked chest. “Are you sure you’re not up for another round?” She purred, and for a single moment, he was tempted. But he was already in enough hot water with Wilkes, and he didn’t feel like pushing it.
“Wilkes, get your ass over here and help me with this,” Dean ordered, and though the other man pursed his lips, he obeyed, taking the bags and setting them down, unpacking them. Secretly, he was relieved that the angel had followed his instructions. Surely this would take the edge off of Dean’s sudden bout of temper: an expensive beer that seemed to glow from within the bottles that held them, several stacked boxes that contained fragrant baked goods, and several girly magazines.
“Yes, but those candidates often lie; we all know most of their promises are out of their capability!” Malachi bites. From his bear face, a loud growl comes out. In return, other Angels start to hiss back at him because of his sudden outburst. “Not to add that the candidate with the most votes wins in the end, so there will be a big part that won’t get what they want.”
But Cas is smiling, making Dean smile as well in turn. It was a fun game. Hopefully, it wouldn’t be the last.
He knows, deep inside, that he needs to follow Cas, needs to tell him that he’s making things up and that he doesn’t need Dean to win this, but the longer he stands there, the more he understands that this might have been building up for a while now.
The moment Dean gets on it, Cas notices him. He calls out for him, and even waves to indicate where he is. As if Dean hasn’t noticed him the moment he got in the hall. Dean just simply waves back and even dares to get to the center of the rink instead of trying out for a few rounds at first. He’s been skating an hour already, and he’s pretty much used to how this is feeling, as well.
“You want to know what happened to the men that were hit by the Cube’s power?” he continues, close to shouting. Dean shuffles backwards just to make sure that he wouldn’t get a hit or anything. Sam, on the contrary, moves forward with his hands raised a little bit. “They disintegrated, disappeared. There was nothing left of them. No ashes, no body parts. They were just gone. And that’s the weapon you’re trying to use
That voice. Sam would recognize it anywhere. He doesn’t even need to look up to know that it comes from a woman with long black hair and beautiful mocha skin.
stupid, he continues to zap. Eventually he stops when he gets to one of the Spider-Man movies. He’s seen it a hundred times already, probably, but at least it doesn’t suck like everything else that is on does.
“No, being the leader hasn’t really been a good thing I’ve ever offered Heaven,” Castiel answers after a few moments of thinking. Azrael only blinks her eyes at that but doesn’t press further. Naomi starts to talk again, trying to lay down some basic rules for the whole thing with the other Angels, but Castiel’s mind travels somewhere else.
“I’m pretty sure it already knows we’re here,” Sam mutters, turning around so fast that it drives his head spinning. He could have sworn he saw something white there, but now that he takes a closer look, there’s nothing there.
“Let me get some clothes,” she tells him. She hurries back to the room next to his, and Castiel waits patiently. He takes out his phone and looks if he’s got a message. He finds himself disappointed when he sees he doesn’t.
“Are you alright, Sam?” Castiel asks. He pulls Sam’s arm to help him get up, and soon both men are standing again. Sam’s still a little out of breath, but at least the pain is gone. “Where’s Dean?”
“What, was I supposed to come from my room, shouting ‘heya guys, I know the Prophecy, and by the way, I’m pregnant, but that’s just a part of it as well’?” Dean mocks, shaking his head in disapproval. Kevin lowers his head a little bit, but not much.
Sam knows all about it though; otherwise he would never have let Dean go here by himself. His baby brother just pretended he had found this interesting book at the library, and thought Dean and Castiel could handle the ‘case’ by themselves.
that his breaks weren't working anymore, causing for him to smash straight into a tree. Dean had been checking them out to see what the problem is, only finding that there's nothing wrong with them at all.
Yàn seems to have no trouble in controlling himself. Meihui, on the other hand, looks like she’s close to pass out on the floor. She’s biting her lip when she stands face to face with Cas, and a loud, high-pitched noise escapes her mouth.
“So, Mr. Novak. I understand you want the custody of your daughter?” she asks politely. Castiel nods slowly.
Jimmy just nods, unable to say anything to it as he enjoys his burger probably way too much. Should Dean comment on it? Maybe not, right?
“No way, you’ll need to pay for them now. I got an extra pair in my trunk, and I think they would be better for you.”
Charlie says goodbye with a long hug. She looks at Dean with sad eyes once she lets go, and Dean is sure he sees a few tears.
“Anything missing?” she asks knowingly. Dean raises his eyebrows for a moment but then starts to think back to the visit. Did the guy say if there was anything stolen?
It’s what lonesome hunters do most of the times; they meet up to do a job, they finish it, they sleep together depending on sexual preferences, and afterwards they don’t really talk about it anymore. Of course it has been more Dean’s style to be that kind of guy, but could anybody really blame Sam for trying to find company after all that Jess-business.
Dean doesn't hesitate anymore in following him back, but he wonders what use it has, since he's not that active on it anyway.
Dean turns to the desk behind their bed, finding that their laptop is already resting on it. Damn those Angels and their ability to think ahead.
So the kid tries. “Mommy… stop it.” It’s barely a whisper, the words don’t even reach his mother’s ears.
He does stay away from the meat. His stomach already starts to ache when he even smells it – which is why he took a minute longer than the others to finally be seated. He’s also forbidden to drink wine, but that’s something he can agree on.
“Of course, miladies,” Castiel jokes with a small bow before grabbing his wallet and heading to the bar. There’s a stool free, but Castiel’s not planning on sitting down. He leans against the counter, makes his order and waits for his drinks to be made. In the meantime, he takes this moment to have a look around.
Castiel reminds himself silently as he follows his brother back to the living room. There he can see Jessica, Amelia and Jimmy serve up the dinner. Dean is still busy putting glasses on the table, while Sam starts pouring wine to the people who want. Haël, though, receives a glass with coke instead.
“You could have hurt yourself Castiel! You have a competition in two weeks, you shouldn’t be doing stuff like that!”
The carpet’s still the same, but the TV has been upgraded when they upgraded the one downstairs. The large block has been moved to the garage, or has been sold perhaps, and the one from downstairs has now been put into their bedrooms. It’s good, since this one actually has HDMI and they can connect Sam’s PS4 onto it.
“Hmmm, yes he has,” Dean says in a sigh. His eyes are closed now, his arms limp right next to his body. He doesn’t want to move anymore.
“Something about him being important for the survival of Heaven,” she says to him, probably remaining vague on purpose. “I won’t tell you the details or you’ll be doing anything you can to stop it from happening,
Before it was easy; Dean had it all, a girlfriend, good job… But then, during a case, he got himself hurt, causing him to lose his connection to metalbending and getting him off the force. They apologized, offered him money to keep on going until he found a new job, but that money had been spend on medical-bills and now he was left with almost nothing. Of course, he didn’t tell his brother that. He didn’t want his pity.
He rests his back against the door and slides down to the floor. His heart is going crazy; its thumping the only thing Dean can hear at the moment. He pulls his knees up and wraps his arms around them, making a cocoon in an attempt to protect himself.
Another problem about Dean having a new body is the fact that all their costumes need replacing. It’s not like he doesn’t fit in their uniform for Game Wardens, but it’s more like he’s drowning inside his clothes that nobody would really be able to take him seriously.
the voice on the other line says. Sam immediately remembers the guy. It’s the one who has also been chasing Lauren’s group of Vampires. If he calls, it could only mean two things. Sam doesn’t know which one he fears most.
“Dangerous places? What have you been doing, Sammy?” Dean slows down the car when he sees a hole in the road. When they pass over it, the whole vehicle bumps up and down, almost waking Kate. She sighs lightly before twisting a little. Her eyes don’t open, at least.
husband killed the guy. In panic, Dean turns to Sam to find him obviously thinking the same thing. There might be a case for them here.
Waking up next to Cas has always been his favorite part of the day. It gives him a feeling Dean hasn’t really felt a lot in his life before aside from when he was with Lisa – and that’s a time he no longer wants to remember at all.
vampire escapes; they’ll build a new nest and start looking for revenge. Sam figures this one is from quite recently, probably back from that case with Jody and Alex.
Maeve looks up at Dean when she finds him banging his head on the beat. Okay, so it’s kind of catchy? Sue him!
“Then try your best to fix it,” he tells her, because Emma’s father knows well enough not to ask for details about these things. That’s the best thing about him; he gives her the chance to fix her mistakes, and damn did she make one now!
, and Dean has hated that noun the moment his brother first pronounced it. “Anyway,” Sam suddenly continues, “I found these strange cables underneath this table, and it kind of got me thinking.” At this he points at the table Dean dropped his bag on. Immediately, the older hunter eyes it suspiciously.
The hotel he’s booked with Sam is small and cheap. There aren’t many rooms at all, and the beds are crappy, but it had been the only thing in affordable range. He’s not complaining at all, though, once he touches the bed. He falls asleep almost immediately.
“Dean, you need to pull up your shirt,” Cas silently whispers to him. Dean startles for a moment, not having noticed that he was being spoken to and finding the other two staring at him, waiting for him to go as he’s told. Luckily, he caught the last part of Cas’ sentence and takes the hem of his shirt in his hands, pulling it upward so his belly gets exposed.
“I can’t do it, Cas,” Dean groans out in annoyance, throwing his arms in the air angrily. Castiel lifts up an eyebrow at him. Dean’s paper is still blank, waiting to be filled with words that explain how he feels about Cas.
Dean is still hanging out with them, and so far Castiel still hasn’t managed to find out what it was that Dean wanted to tell him in the car that day. He figures that, if he isn’t telling him now, it probably wasn’t that important after all.
,” Cas adds to it with a light chuckle right before yawning. That, in turn, makes Dean yawn as well. When the nurse comes in with a new IV bag, Dean just nods at her and allows her to do her job.
Behind them another group of officers show up, holding up a blanket and putting it over Ronnie’s body, covering his form from everybody there. The three take a step back to get out of their way.
“Your amazing charms? You just happen to run into all the cougars on the way?” Claire asks jokingly as she wraps her arms together over her chest. Sam, too, wants to answer the question on
Sam looks at her for a long time, trying to figure out what she’s up to, but already knowing that he won’t find out by her face alone. She looks smug, as if she’s going to be the only one winning here. And Sam knows that she’s taking advantage of his weak spot – Dean will
But that’s not true. Dean looks at the fourth chair at the table right after the waiter walks off to pass along their orders. In front of him, Sam is saying something to Jessica. Their hands are resting on the table, fingers tangled together in a gentle hold. Whatever they’re talking about, Dean can’t hear it as he takes in the empty place next to him.
His arms move before he can really think too much about it. It’s such a familiar gesture by now, repeated for years and years but never shown to anybody other than his coach from that time. The wheels under his skates softly roll over the floor, making him move in a half circle before he continues backwards.
All air leaves his body when, suddenly, Bobby’s arms are wrapped around him. When it comes to hugs, this one is a strong one. Castiel is barely able to breathe. He feels Bobby gently slap him on the back, a sniff coming from his direction.
At least one good thing came from that impromptu wakeup call: his morning wood had officially worn off, thank God. Though, he mused to himself, that he’d stopped believing in God years ago.
Dean had been kissed before, but never, ever like this. Never so gently, so tenderly, as if he were being explored, enjoyed. He was so tender, and his ragged breathing turned Dean on.
“I didn’t know what flavors of pie you would enjoy,” Cas said quietly, “so I got several. I hope you like them.” His voice was quiet and shy, and his heart skipped when his eyes met Dean’s. They were the rich, gorgeous blue of a spring sky, with a ring of brown around his pupils.
“Dean, why don’t you open a beer for our guest?” Wilkes asked. He wanted to widen his eyes, do something to signal to stop acting so fucking weird. The man was a bodyguard and nothing more, but Dean acted like he was about to jump out of his skin. Much to Wilkes’s surprise, Dean obeyed, uncharacteristically quiet. He took a bottle out of its paper holder, twisting the top off and setting it in front of Castiel, making a point not to touch him.
Castiel had been kissed before, by women. And it had been nice, even pleasurable; a fun way to pass time on Earth. His kisses with Jimmy’s wife, those heated, breathless exchanges with Meg; these all paled in comparison to his first with Dean Winchester.
Wilkes had given him directions, and they’d been vague, so vague, in fact, that he’d needed to hook up a near-defunct GPS that offered more static than real help. Nonetheless, he got to the venue; he’d come this far, and he had the job already.
Chapter Six, Ride, is live at last! Dean and Wilkes talk about Baby, and Wilkes tells Dean that he has Castiel to thank for rescuing Baby. What will happen next? Read on to find out!
Cas seems content with the result then because the finger moves again, forward this time until he’s all the way inside. It hurts less, but it still feels weird. It almost feels wrong but right at the same time, and Dean can’t really say why. He huffs out another breath when Castiel moves the finger out again only to push it back in.
“Yeah, well, maybe you were right,” Dean admits after a moment. “Yeah, he seems like a good man… considering.”
The younger hunter sits up with his hands thrown in the air. His eyes find Dean immediately, and Dean smirks up at him as he finally sits down next to the both of them.
That same evening they go out to a restaurant and get some fancy dinner together. Sam and Jessica talk about how they’re doing at school, and in turn Dean tells a little bit about what has been going on in Pontiac for the last few weeks. He doesn’t bring up everything, but that’s mostly because even he doesn’t understand everything just happened yet.
“Didn’t peg you for churchy,” he says. A small smile forms on her face, so Dean knows – to his relief – that he hasn’t offended her.
music is playing at it’s keeping him awake, feeding this massive headache that keeps on getting stronger by the minute.
“Who are you?” he asks with his shoulders tensed, and the other one, the woman, looks up at him. Her dark blue eyes don’t let go of the stare they’re sharing. The way she’s watching him makes it clear to him that she must be an Angel; she stands there like how Cas used to stand back when they weren’t even friends, which is a real long time ago.
After that, they show some images of Cas. Dean notes that his uniform looks quite a lot like the thing he wore on the bachelor-party, only now he’s in a golden legging instead of a black suit pants. He’s wearing a white loose shirt and a sleeveless jacket on top of it. His hair is slicked back in that neat way of his, and he looks like he just shaved, since Dean often saw him with the fresh beginnings of a beard before now.
“Partner?” Castiel asks in surprise. The term could mean a lot of things, and the first thing that comes into his mind is also the last thing he would expect from Angels. Gadreel and Abner have been locked up since before the dawn of time, and the rules were even stricter back then. There’s no possible way that they were what he thinks they were.
“He’s in the library,” Lauren says, like she’s just read his mind or something. “Still keeping up that research. You know it’ll get done faster if you two help him out a little bit.”
Yes, Ellen is really just such a blessing. It’s impossible how she manages to stay calm like that when it’s obvious that she’s pissed off as Hell.
“Why didn’t you tell us?” Sam asks a few seconds after Dean’s finished, his voice low but not angry. Dean still can’t find it in himself to meet his eyes, feeling a bit too ashamed for keeping this for so long.
Though now as well, with Cas on the other side of the line of the phone, Dean finds himself short of words. It’s clearly one of those days, so it seems. Of course, they’ve talked a lot already today, so it’s normal that they’re a bit more quiet right now.
“Hey, Kevin? He’s doing great right now, so don’t worry about him anymore,” Dean assures him. Garth doesn’t answer to that, so Dean takes that as his cue to leave. He nods shortly at Garth, eyes the other two in the kitchen shortly, and then he makes a turn. His hand is already on the doorknob when Garth calls out for him.
“But Metatron says it isn’t?” Lauren adds. She would know, since she’s been there with Sam most of the time. Whenever Metatron refused to say anything more, she would open her mouth and speak out a low threat his way to put him back on his place.
?” she then asks eventually, however she doesn’t sound completely convinced. It’s clear in her voice.
Now there are still many dangers on the world, especially with the demons now returned to Earth. But they’re weak. They are dangerous still, but there’s still time until they start forming a real threat again.
“Sorry it took so long. There was quite a line,” he says with something in his tone Castiel can’t really place.
In front of him sits Balthazar, who wants to spend his Sunday-evening with his brother. He’s ordered a cocktail, and is at this point still drinking from it, despite it being an hour ago since he ordered it.  At first the conversations were about Castiel’s first week at school, how the things went, what he didn’t like, if he made any new friends. Castiel knows Balthazar doesn’t just ask to have a conversation. The man just wants to know if Castiel has even been
“Then there’s also this whole thing with Jessica. I’m actually afraid that she might start liking Marv and I hate it so much,” he complains. Castiel’s heart breaks, wishing he could just help Sam out. But he can’t just tell him to go for it. Not yet. He needs to help Marv just a little bit longer.
After that, Dean puts the phone aside to tend to the next few customers. In the corner of his eyes he can see that Hannah apparently failed to take Castiel along. Dean almost lets out a sigh, especially when the guy starts playing with his water. He quickly takes a look at his watch, finding that he has one more hour to go before the place closes. This shift has passed by rather quickly, he notes.
to stop it from happening. I have to warn you that by doing that, you’ll be heading down a dangerous path. More specifically,
“Honestly, I have no plans. Maybe I will just go skating for a bit,” Dean says while shrugging. Sam gives him a long look before eventually nodding. He sits down at the table, taking a seat in front of Dean. His hair is curly and messy, and honestly, it’s making him look like a damn teenager. But, on the other hand, that hairstyle is just so completely
And it all just explodes. Cas burns so brightly that his skin almost looks white. It’s the first time that Dean dares to keep his eyes open while it happens, wondering what made him even think that that’s a good idea. His eyes might have burned out from Cas’s true image, but instead, all Dean could see was his Grace, his true form, in all its majesty.
But Gadreel doesn’t try to be resentful of them. It’s not like they chose it, either. Most of all, he’s angry at his father, who seemed to have thought involving them in this matter would be a good idea. They’ve been through so much together, but as long as they had each other, things had been bearable. Now that he’s alone again, Gadreel wonders if he can even still be considered an Angel. He doesn’t feel like one, anymore, feeling more human than anything.
Sam, on the other hand, hasn’t really smiled much in the past month. Sometimes his lips slightly curl upwards, but then he catches himself and puts back this sour face of bitter heartbreak Dean can no longer look at. Lauren’s gone, Sam should better just live with it.
He doesn’t know what exactly has been said in the time he’s spaced out, but when he looks up again his hands are freed and the Sheriff’s head has been chopped off his neck.
His suspicions are right when he turns around and sees Claire walking back up to him. Ben isn’t there, though.
Castiel stumbles out of the car. He barely gets his key in the lock of the door, and when he opens it he accidentally bumps against the table. He lets out a quiet curse before taking a moment to keep his head straight.
“Not only that, but his first creations? The Leviathan?” Dean nods, feeling like growling at the mention of those sons of bitches. “He was so proud of them, but they became destructive, and had this appetite for more and more chaos. So he had to lock them away, too.”
Dean has thought quite often about how he would die. He has died, a few times, too. A lot of times, according to Sam, but since Dean can’t remember any of those hundred times, he can’t really count those, right?
After a little while, Alan stops again, keeping one hand stuck on Dean’s shirt and lifting the other one’s in Cas’ direction. The former Angel then removes his own hand from behind Alan’s head, and he allows his son to grab his finger with his little ones.
They lose their clothes before they even get to the chorus of the song. Dean’s fingers are determent to touch everywhere. Castiel just takes it, unknowingly spreading his legs again, allowing Dean to rest his hips between them.
“We set out another search for him, like you asked. We’re still not giving up.” His hand passes over his face and he sniffs his nose when he feels the cold finally getting to him. It’s February, and it’s cold, and Dean should really return home before he gets sick. “I’m still not sure if we’re going to find him, of course, but like you said, Dad, it’s worth the try.”
Dean Winchester, his older brother, who is currently stuck in a hospital room for who knows how long, currently being visited by his husband and sons, Claire, and a happy Werewolf-family Sam is honestly glad to have escaped before he left.
The second video ends as well, and the browser automatically goes onto the next one. It’s one of Cas’ old performances, Dean notes. He looks a bit younger and skinnier then, with his hair quite a bit longer. When he sees that it’s from 2005, his mind immediately makes the connection.
“Not anymore,” he says, inviting himself in. He’s quickly followed by Castiel and then Mr. Pryce, who’s closing the door behind them to keep the cold air out. The man’s house looks like an explosion happened inside a library; hundreds of books are scattered around the floor, and some are stacked up in to high towers. As Castiel walks into the living room, he finds himself face to face with what looks like a poster for Mr. Pryce’s old magician-act. The face on it is that of a child, probably himself from back in that time.
One day, Dean finds Sam in the recreation room, where his younger brother is sitting on the couch and sporting the biggest smile Dean’s ever seen on him. With a frown and a smirk, Dean sits himself down next to him and turns his face towards him.
So here he finds himself, alone again (or not really), with just more research ahead of him. But even as he plants himself behind the books does he realize that today, just like all the other days, he won’t be able to find anything. There’s just nothing written like this, and every possible loophole they’ve come across has either such a bad side-effect (like Cas dying, or the twins dying, or unleashing the end of the world (again)…) or requires for Dean to sacrifice somebody to whatever God that can help him.
“Before getting you to the operation room, we’ll give you an IV and a catheter. Now the last one might be a scary thought, but your anesthesia will have kicked in by then so you won’t feel a thing,” Dr. Pine then adds. Cas frowns for a moment.
“Where are we?” Dean asks as he takes the file out of Castiel’s hand. Inias handed it to them during the party, claiming that everything had been arranged for them for the next three months, and that all the expenses were covered for them. Dean hadn’t really understood what he meant, but when he notices the long building on the hills further away, he slowly gets an idea of where they might be.
He does notice how the redheaded girl looks at the both of them like they’re eye candy. Huh, so that’s how it feels from the other side. Dean’s not exactly annoyed, instead extremely amused. Still, to make clear that he’s actually taken, he wraps his arm around Cas’s middle when they walk towards the room they’ve been assigned by the two ladies. Cas seems confused, but he doesn’t ask about it.
Dean notices the Captain staring at him as well, eyes big in wonder and surprise, and Dean is sure he can see a little bit of pain hidden inside of there. Not much he can do about that, right. He stands back up, fishes a packet of M&N’s out of his bag, and offers one to Sam – and then, just so he isn’t too much of a jerk – he points it towards the Captain as well, but he is just shaking his head.
“You should,” Charlie says, looking around quickly before pulling out her phone. Either way, even if they would get caught, Mrs. Barnes doesn’t care either way. She always lets them do whatever they want, which is what makes her everybody’s favorite teacher at this school. “Take a look at this.”
“What makes you say the hunt isn’t over?” Tracy asks when Sam unlocks the car to get inside the trunk and check if the weapons are still there. The moment Sam looks up again, the figure’s back, hiding in the shadow underneath a tree further away.
“I do have to admit that my voice often betrays me. There’s acne on my face, which I’ve never had to deal with before. Also…” then he shuts up, and Sam dares to turn his head for a moment to find Castiel looking hesitantly ahead of him.
Dean thinks it’s endearing that Cas cares so much about it. He’s been made aware of everything; how Gadreel and Abner fell in love despite that not being a possibility in their programming, how Lucifer tricked them by using Gadreel to get to Abner.
Yes, Dean might have made an involuntary jump, and ended up landing on the ground when gravity decided to be against him. If a sound also left his mouth, he does sure hope Jimmy won’t ever hear of it.
“We’re Men of Letters. It’s our Legacy,” Sam answers. Dean then sighs as well, leaning his head back and licking his lips before then clapping his hands together.
think this is a good idea,” Cas mutters as he’s being guided forward. Once they’re at the spot Cas needs to be, Dean lets go of his hand and instead grabs his arms in a strong grip, shaking him a little bit.
Abner is lifeless, eyes closed and his wings burned down on the ground. Gadreel takes him into his arms, pressing their foreheads together as his tears drop down on Abner’s face. This must be about the most emotion Sam has ever seen on another Angel’s face aside from Cas.
Sometimes, that privacy can get really annoying. For instance, the fact that Dean won’t tell him what exactly happened to him in that djinn-made life bothers him really hard, and more than once he’s thought about just reading his mind while he wanders off again in his thoughts. A better part of him stops him every time, though. If Dean doesn’t want to share it, who is Castiel to disrespect that wish?
“Maybe partly, yes,” Castiel confesses. “I know we can’t have kids – or maybe technically right now we can, but we agreed not to. All I’m trying to say is, before we got together I couldn’t care any less about children. It’s since I’ve been with you that I’ve been craving for it. And I remembered that feeling Jimmy had when he thought back about his wife or his daughter, and somehow I wanted that for myself.”
Sam Winchester parks his stolen car into an empty spot in front of the small bar. It’s raining, it’s cold, and Sam’s good mood is very far away, somewhere unable for him to reach.
“Why, I’m a psychic of course,” Dean gets as an answer. Of course, it should have been obvious. What was he thinking? Dean could almost roll his eyes, wondering why she would have thought he would jump to that conclusion right away. “Now, enough with the chatter. I’m still working and you are a paying client.”
“I love you, Jessica, and I’m grateful that you care, but this isn’t something any of us can repair.” Then he presses a soft kiss on her forehead and pulls back a little, keeping one arm around her shoulder. Together they walk to the docks to get to the boat they rented.
“Cas,” Dean moans out. He throws his head back to allow his husband more space. He feels his hands move towards his ass, and before he knows it Cas is lifting him up from the ground and moving them through the hallway.
“Okay, Dean,” Castiel tells him obediently, but he then smiles too. Dean moves their foreheads against each other and for a moment their lips touch, but not for long. They’re both fine with just standing like this; close together, in a tight embrace.
Hello Frank, I’m glad you suggested me this. I’ll surely take this request and make something of it. Still, I’m going to give you a teaser; just wait until you’re absolutely ready. Don’t rush things and try to take your time.
“You should have asked Cas to come along,” Dean mutters. Sam is sure that he’s feeling conflicted on whether or not he should go in with Sam, given his promise not to hunt anymore. Sam would also feel like a jerk to send him all the way back to Lebanon, having made that drive for nothing.
“That’s okay, sir. I’m pretty open-minded about these sort of things,” Sam tells him, which is a lie. He doesn’t believe in alien-abductions. The only reason he’s ready to listen to this upcoming crap is because he knows the trickster played a part in this.
“What are our plans tonight?” Cas asks when the first free skaters get onto the rink. It’s two teenage girls who don’t seem too stable on the ice and are mostly just giggling as they keep on falling down.
It’s better not to say anything anymore. Especially when Dean feels his own tears rolling down his cheek all of the sudden. He hadn’t even realized he started crying. Instead, he clings on to Castiel tighter, making him sob even harder in his arms.
“I was just wondering… uhm,” Kate starts, then biting her lip and fumbling with the sleeves of her sweater. Dean frowns, almost afraid of what she’s going to ask if she’s so hesitant about this.
And with that, Annie gets out of the room, leaving Dean and Cas behind. Dean hurries to the bench and takes off his skates to switch them back to his shoes. The moment they’re off, Cas takes them from Dean and puts them into the black bag they’re always in. Then he hangs the bag over his shoulder, and holds out his hand for Dean to hold, mirroring what Dean always does for Cas after a day of training. Dean smirks and lets himself be pulled up.
“Also, thanks, for implying that wanting to save my child means I’m messed up. That’s, really, one of the best compliments you’ve given me, so far.”
She takes a step forward, trying to move closer to the figure, but there’s no change in the distance. When she moves forward, the silhouette moves backwards. No matter how many steps she takes, she just can’t reach them.
As they agreed, the place they’re taking Annie to is Dean’s house. They’ve cleaned up Dean’s mess in the past week, making sure that it’s livable for the woman for the time being. It’s not that Dean has a lot of stuff that needs to be private, but even now he feels a tad bit more relaxed knowing that they’ve cleaned the place completely for her arrival. The stuff that they took away has been moved to Cas’ place.
When Sam clears his throat, Dean startles, nodding quickly before joining the others. While the women are praying, all he can think about is what he’s going to eat for dinner. Maybe he can convince Cas to eat as well? That would be great, because Dean wants to introduce him to all kinds of food.
Sam lets out a long breath and closes his eyes while he tries to clear his head. He had completely forgotten about the warning, but now that he knows about it, isn’t it obvious that he can do everything he can not to make that happen? He’s done too much to close the gates of Hell. He won’t let his own stupidity reopen it.
So Dean doesn’t say anything. He can use the silence, dream some more about that hot bath he’s been thinking about. Luckily there’s at least one bath tub in this building, and he’s planning on using it that evening; preferably with his Angel husband, of course.
“Are you surprised about it?” he asks, and Jessica pulls back, keeping her hands on his shoulders. Her eyes look sympathetic.
times gold in a row? This guy must be a genius on the ice! Dean makes a promise to himself to look up some videos of him.
The only one seeming open to have Marv joining them is Jessica, bless her soul. She’s just too kind for this world, Castiel figures.
“The anesthesia is done, so you can go. She might need you as they place the catheter,” the man says while drying his hands and reaching for a face mask. Castiel nods again. Karen opens up the door for him, making sure that he doesn’t dirty his hands again. A few of the nurses offer him gloves as he gets inside the room, and with their assistance he puts them on. When he turns around to check on Karen, the woman is already finished and making her way behind the sheet. Where Castiel isn’t allowed to go.
Dean feels his opening wider with every second that passes. Each landing Cas makes after a jump is completely on point, balance perfect whenever he pushes himself off the ice. His arms move along with him. Dean is almost even sure that his eyes are closed during the entire performance.
Somehow, during the whole Apocalypse, Cas seemed to have found something in Sam worth saving after getting himself in the cage. Sure, Cas didn’t do an all to good job at it, but it’s the gesture that counts, right?
When Castiel realizes Dean is gone, he goes to search for him in their bedroom. When he finds both Dean and Claire lying asleep on the bed, something weird goes through his chest, and he can’t help but feel the need to shuffle close next to Dean.
Bobby calls. The Angel and the Hunter quickly turn to look at each other in a slight moment of panic.
“Eh, it’s no big deal, I can take him home,” he answered then, knowing that this wasn’t really a good idea. What was Jimmy’s deal pushing his brother like this, while it was obvious that he was very uncomfortable?
“Considering what?” she asks him while he lets the cold water splash over his face. It feels amazing to freshen up like that. He rubs his mouth and nose clean before answering her, though.
Dean closes his eyes then, tries to count to ten in his head while his breathing evens out again. It’s alright, this isn’t world-news. Dean’s face won’t end up in multiple magazines or newspapers, and there won’t be a million articles appearing on the internet.
“You’re right, Dean. I’ll call Tracy and I’ll ask her to join me,” Sam says, making his way out of the library and back into the war room, putting his cellphone on his ear. Dean frowns for a moment, looking back at Cas who has a serious look on his face.
“Can’t I stay here for once? I’m really tired,” Dean mutters out with an arm pressed against his eyes. Then he turns his head to the side only to find Cas already dressed in loose clothes.
Oh God, please, not again. Not another lesson from the Angels, not another one where’s he’s suddenly confronted by his older self. But, he figures, Castiel doesn’t see a difference. The junky from 2014 had seen he wasn’t the same even without his Grace, but this Castiel doesn’t.
“Well, I can give you the full Prophecy,” Dean finally says after a long moment of thinking. Because he remembers the Prophecy by heart. It’s like it’s written inside of his brain, and he can see it in front of him, so clearly.
When he gets out the shower, putting on his boxers, he leans over the sink and takes a look at his reflection. His thoughts to back to what Anna always used to tell him; that he’s got a lot of features from their dad, except for the dark hair. Castiel can’t really remember his father all that much, but he can remember the blue eyes.
“Why are they standing so close together?” Dean interrupts when he can’t stand it anymore. Castiel coughs subtly and Dean throws him a short look in annoyance. Marie’s cheeks seem to flush for a moment, and she smiles again.
Dean asks after a while of staring into his Angel’s eyes. Sam groans in frustration and throws his hands in the air.
“Alright, Dean,” he says, all too aware that Dean isn’t taking his eyes off the street in front of him. “Thank you.”
“Right, Jimmy and I are just going to watch the others in the meantime. You better not make us wait all that time for a crappy performance, okay?”
"Yup, I fell on my ass during my first conest," Castiel slurs out before yawning. "Placed last. Jimmy wouldn't let me hear the end of it."
After a short stop at a tanking station and eleven more hours of silence, Castiel does eventually pull up in front of a house that clearly shows that they’re not very welcome. The gates are full with signs that warns visitors to stay away, and there’s almost more garden outside than inside the lot.
“Get back up there, idiot. You have the gold, you’re supposed to be on the highest part of the stage, not the lowest,” Dean whispers to him. Cas nods, letting go of Dean and getting himself back to where he was before with the help of the other two skaters. Then Dean skates around the podium, coming to stand behind Cas, who holds out his hand for Dean to take.
“I just-“ Sam begins, but then he looks down, not really sure what he’s supposed to say, here. “I did some research, and I found that there’s been some deaths here a few years back that were never really explained.”
“You know, when I hear ‘teleport’ I can’t help but think ‘Crossroads Demon’,” Sam suddenly says when he finishes chewing the last bit of his dinner. They’ve been busy leaving suggestions all the time – Sam even dared to try the excuse of Cas’s monster-radar being broken. Dean hadn’t been happy about that one.
“What’s the news?” Dean asks. Before he joins his brother he first makes his way to the refrigerator to get another bottle of beer, but when his hand touches it, he quickly changes his mind, instead grabbing a can of soda. After closing the refrigerator, Dean moves forward to join his brother. He might as well get the current status on the progress before he makes his way through there.
Dean waves at the two, and they see that as a confirmation to approach them. Next to Dean, Cas hands back somebody’s pen and thanks them for rooting for him. Dean wraps his arm around the other man’s waist once he stands up again, safely next to Dean.
He tries calling three more times. The first time, he sees Cas looking at the screen, but ignoring it. The second time, Cas ends the call. By the time the French guy is finished with his program, Dean tries for the last time. This time, he can see Cas sigh, pressing the screen, and finally lifting the phone to his ear.
“Mrs. Winchester, your weight is obviously at the low side,” Dr. Ralph says without even reading the numbers, eyes instead resting on his thin arms and pointy shoulders. Dean looks down in shame, understanding that Cas must be a bit betrayed now.
“I’m sorry, Castiel,” she tells him. Castiel knows she’s trying to comfort him, but it won’t do any good in this case. He needs to remind himself that Dean didn’t purposely cheat on him. He didn’t know, he didn’t know,
“Yeah, if by forcing yourself on him you mean that you were trying to make out with him without giving him room to breathe, then sure, call it that,” Dean mutters back. Balthazar throws him a glare, but then sighs.
“I’m happy to see you,” Cas says, walking closer to Dean and asking for a quick kiss. Dean instead wraps his arms around him, gives him a quick peck on his lips, and then leans his head on the Angel’s shoulder as he clings to him.
“Am I allowed in the operation room?” Cas asks urgently while grabbing Dean’s hand in his own. He squeezes his fingers shortly, but Dean doesn’t return the gesture, feeling too hopeless at the moment. This is the moment he realizes he truly has no control over his life, anymore.
“He’s been asleep the entire time,” the Prophet explains. “Whatever startled Alan, Jonah wasn’t awake to see it.”
I am aware that Pontiac doesn't have a skating rink, so I'm just using a fictional one! I've never been to Pontiac and I don't know too much about it other than what I find online.
“So, how’s Heaven?” Dean asks against Castiel’s ear. His hand slowly passes over his back, and they finally pull back slightly, only to look each other in the eyes. Castiel can feel Dean’s breath pass over his skin. They’ve never been this close before since this thing started between them last week, but Castiel really likes this.
And as Sam nods, the bed moves forward again after a warning from the nurse that they can’t wait any longer. As Dean gets further away from him, their hands lose contact again, and as he sees his brother disappear through the door, he realizes that this will be the last time he saw his brother alive.
“You sure you’re okay?” he asks her worriedly. Tracy throws a small look over her shoulder, looking pensive for a moment. Then, a small smile appears on her face, and she nods, leaning forward to kiss him again, and again.
Dean’s eyes widen in the biggest surprise he’s ever had. How does Cas even think Dean will survive that?
“I’m sorry, Dean,” Castiel returns, crying just as hard as his broken husband. After that, a second shriek comes out into the room. Dean, who had been just crying, now seems to be panicking completely. The color on his face is now completely gone, he’s continuously out of breath, and the monitor next to him is going insane. Now that the twins are out, there’s nothing there to keep Dean alive. Nothing there to heal his body continuously.
Because every fiber in his body had hoped that Dean was Wind, and now he just feels like the biggest jerk because of that. With shaky hands, he reaches for his phone, remembering that he got a message earlier. He still hasn’t read it. The light of the screen hurts his eyes, but he bites through it.
“Did you kill them?” Sam asks, letting go of Dean then, meaning that it’s now the Angel’s turn to hug him again. And so the Angel does, wrapping his arms around Dean, only holding him in a much stronger embrace than his brother’s.
“Hey Benny,” Dean said once he was standing behind one of the guys he recognized. The man turned around to face him, and smiled as soon as he saw Dean standing there.
this feels right indeed. So right, and so hot, and so much. He knows there’s slight panic starting to grow in his belly, but he doesn’t want to let go just yet. Not when this feeling, having Cas pressed so close against him, just feels so perfect to him.
“Who?” he asks in a whisper, though he knows what she means. She thinks he’s broken, that some girl broke his heart and left him in pieces and unable to ever recollect himself. She’s almost right.
Suddenly, he’s not in the bed anymore. He’s in Hell, surrounded by smoke and hot air. A figure existing out of black smoke hovers all over him. He’s tied up, naked, like he’s always been, but this time the ropes seem to be holding to him tighter. With every move he makes something seems to cut into him. The figure hovering above him takes on a corporeal form, taking the appearance of some sort of doctor, scrubs covered with dark blood. Dean knows it’s his blood from his previous torture session.
“Mr. Winchester!” one of the nurses calls out, but both Sam and Castiel ignore her. With a slam, Cas opens the door again, but Sam doesn’t follow him immediately. Getting in will mean that it’s permanent, definite. Anna didn’t say anything, but the shake of her head had been enough. But, to get inside would mean that he would see the proof that his brother didn’t make it.
Sam’s arm reaches forward, and his fingers find their way in Lauren’s soft hair. He wishes this kiss would never end – despite the awkward position they’re in at the moment. It’s not the most comfortable of them all, not even a single bit. That’s why the kiss ends so soon, in Sam’s opinion.
"I went to Russia," Castiel explains plainly before finishing his drink in one go again. "And before that London, and the year before
Dean barely makes it to the bathroom, and he doesn’t even notice Lauren standing in front of the mirror with her towel around her body, fresh out of the shower. The first thing Dean does is kneel down in front of the toilet and leaning his head above it so his dinner from last night can get out again.
He only stops in his steps when he notices an overturned chair on the floor of what must be a kitchen. Now, a normal chair wouldn’t be all that interesting right here, but it’s mostly the handcuffs that get Dean’s attention here.
Cas raises his eyebrow at the mention of sex, and Dean remembers the way the guy thinks about that. He then just shrugs; just because Cas thinks of it his way doesn’t mean that Dean agrees with it. He can understand it, sure, but it’s just not for him.
But as she’s busy undressing him, he figures that nine years of age-difference isn’t that much, right? And she seems to be willing enough to do this, too. So, maybe he shouldn’t stop her?
So, Dean lowers his hand, not removing the one he still has wrapped around her neck. With a long look from Rowena, he then finally releases her completely, raising his hands and feeling the power slip away again. His head is buzzing when she starts speaking her incantation, and for a moment he wonders if it isn’t some delayed effect from that spell she cast out on him. What was all that about, even?
As it turns out, there’s only more creepy stuff scattered around here. It’s mostly random crap that one would sell on a yard sale, but obviously somebody couldn’t part from her things back when she was still alive. There are cobwebs hanging all around. Next to him, there’s a bird cage, luckily empty of a rotting bird carcass.
“You really have no taste,” Dean mutters to her. Lauren gasps a breath, pretending to feel insulted.
The rest of the phone call is filled with Dean asking Sam how his own hunt is going, but eventually they hang up the moment Cas parks the car in front of that Rick Willis guy who burned himself to death.
“Yes, they are,” Castiel answers truthfully. The nurse – Karen is written on her nametag – smiles at him and looks so genuinely happy for him. Castiel figures she would be, since she doesn’t know what is going to come afterwards. But he figures Dr. Pine has realized it as well, having taken a good look at Dean’s vitals and making the math. Dean is too skinny, too weak to go through this unscathed.
“So you won’t help us?” Sam asks, disappointment thick in his voice. Castiel can’t even begin to imagine how the hunter must be feeling right at this moment.
The best part; Castiel actually got to meet Chris Evans. He’d been freaking out the entire day, but the actor seemed to have been delighted to meet him. At least, that’s what it looked like. Surely, the man is just friendly to all of his fans.
