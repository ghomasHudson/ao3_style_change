“Look, he’s already found them,” the male guard, said, sounding amused, “he’s fucking itching to have a go at the guy.”
After a moment’s careful consideration, Steve stepped even closer. The hand that landed on Tony’s bare ribs was warm and calloused, only the coldness of steel between his fingers disrupting the impression. Tony leaned his head back against the wall, imagining that the heartbeat rushing in his ears was Steve’s.
“Nothing to say for yourself?” Asked the second guard. His squeaky voice got on Tony’s nerves. “You think you’re too good to talk to us?”
Kneeling on the ground by the trap door, Tony tried to get a read on his discovery. The heavy metal structure of the bunker blocked all the scanning tech he brought.
It was times like this that he wished that he, like the Skull, had found a way to be entirely machine.
No, better not. He couldn’t do this to Steve, couldn’t put him in this position. They were getting out.
Deliberately blocking the guards’ view with his shoulders, Tony crossed his fingers over the handle of the picana. He glanced down and felt Steve’s eyes follow his own.
He couldn’t reach out. He felt it as Steve swung back into the wall, couldn’t reach out with his hand and stop his head hitting against the brick, couldn’t reach over and soothe the shaking, convulsing muscles of his arms.
he mouthed, the word so tiny Tony almost missed it, and then rubbed the salt gently into the flesh of his upper shoulder, his fingers making circles as though applying solution.
In his twenties, he’d learned he did his best work on the precipice of running out of gas. There was a moment, always, where he felt helpless, where he’d think things like,
Just like last time, he had failed Steve. He had failed to notice the issue — had failed to realize Steve was within reach this whole time, somehow retrievable from the dead. He had failed to stop Steve being shot twice, now. He had failed to find the gas dispensers in time.
As exhausted as he was, he wasn’t able to shake the dreams for long. The warm, dreamless slumber changed shape, dragged him as though heavy,  muddied water, back into the crypt, where Steve’s body lay dead, bleeding out from the stomach wound, and Tony was poking it with the picana. It was dead -- pale, cold, set awkwardly with rigor mortis -- but each time he shocked it, it gave the breathy little scream, and Tony knew, somehow, that he was killing it again, but he could nothing more, could be nothing more. Hands grabbed at him, shook him, pulled him, monster, murderer, torturer, wake up, wake up, Tony—
“Jesus,” he muttered, pressing his hands against his eyes, and tried to catalogue everything that he’d heard. It wasn’t a task that the normal human brain would be up for, but Extremis left him with no imperfections. His brain, finally, could keep track of everything he’d always wanted to hold inside it.
There was no way to do this gracefully. Tony hunched over and reared back, turning on his heel to try to ram the top of the collar into the corner, catching himself on the wall with open palms. The little ridges stuck, so, in desperation, he swung himself at the wall again and again, hoping to use his weight and the sharp edge to finally bend one, snap one off.
Steve had died on April 1st, the world’s least funny joke yet, and on the first of October, people held candlelight vigils on the steps of the courthouse. Tony had been overseas. When he finally returned home and saw the footage on TV three days later, the guilt was dull, subdued. By then he was carrying enough guilt on his shoulders to drown out all but the loudest cries of his consciousness.
Sin stared at him, and then, suddenly, she smiled, the corners of her mouth quirking up sardonically.
“Ten opponents on each side,” he told Steve, “whatever their weapons are, they’ve melted straight through the suit and taken me down once.” He indicated the messy melted holes on the chest plate and leg armor.
Steve’s free hand landed, lightly, on his waist. Tony couldn’t tell if it was to keep him still or to comfort him.
“— to kill him?” Someone was asking in faintly accented English. Tony watched, in his mind’s eye, Extremis rebuilding the walls of the severed blood vessel, stopping the gushing blood flow, assessing the damage inflicted by the burns.
Slowly, feeling the eyes of everyone in the room on him, he hooked it up to the car battery in the corner. His hands shook badly enough that it took him several tries to get the wire in place. When he turned back, he could see uncertainty, confusion, written into the line of Steve’s eyebrows.
Steve’s eyes followed him. He was awake, alert. His expression was mask-like, so neutral Tony could see nothing at all behind his pale blue eyes.
There was no self in the noise, nothing but a general awareness of all ambient information. The goal — sabotage — was lost.
Somewhere, Tony could hear footsteps, more guards rushing into the hall. He expected these ones to be armed with the melting guns. He brute-forced his way into the system, then, and the cameras gave, showing him the crew of men.
Steve stepped away from him. Tony’s waist felt strangely cold, bereft of the touch. When had it been that someone had last touched him, skin on skin? How pathetic was it, to care here and now?
I won’t forget this time, I— where your mother’s buried, close to where the the mansion stood, somewhere…”
“Cap,” Tony said, kneeling down by him, his hands going immediately for the bullet wound, “let me see.”
The armor had been pulled off him without being disassembled; he could feel the unusual lightness of his limbs, the emptiness of his bones.
Steve could take it with the serum, probably, but Tony could already feel himself reaching for the cattle prod. The nasty little device was predictable, mechanical. If nothing else, he could know exactly what he was doing, exactly the consequences to expect.
They didn’t ask him to walk this time around. One of the guards grabbed him under the arms and pulled him roughly upwards. Barely resisting, he stumbled with them into the hall, into a larger cell across from his. His foot bumped into a rack, and he saw the expected items — the car battery, the rack of torture implements, the familiar little picana. The same one, probably.
It had been just like this last time, Steve’s body laid out in front of him, riddled with bullet holes, Steve’s blood staining his tattered uniform, Steve’s eyes, blue and half-shut, glassy.
“I’m sorry,” he mumbled, “I’m sorry, I’m sorry, I’m sorry. I’ll do better this time. None of that— not the sea, not the arctic, somewhere nice— somewhere homey, close to home, New York, some nice plot, some nice headstone— roses, I don’t
It was, of course, no use. Steve picked up the heavily metal shelving and, using it as a battering ram, he leapt forward to join the fight.
Steve obeyed him on both counts, keeping both of his hands on the wound. He walked stiffly, doubled over and barely bending his legs.
Steve’s eyes stayed on his face. Tony imagined leaning forward, making use of the little slack in the chains, to press his tired body against Steve’s warm, solid flank.
“Get up,” said the first guard. As bulky as the uniforms were, with the helmet covering her face, Tony hadn’t realized she’d been a woman until she’d spoken. Good for Hydra, he supposed, equal opportunity fascism and all.
“This is gonna hurt,” Tony said, trying to sound threatening, and thrust the prod out for Steve to see
“Yes,” Tony barked, sharp, “fine. I’m saying the gas is our best bet, if there is any. Still, though, be prepared for them to burst in.”
The flow of blood was ebbing. Holding the gauze in place with one hand, Tony reached for Steve’s limp wrist with his other, half collapsing into the fallen man, his forehead pressed against Steve’s open palm.
The door gave way not long after. Steve knocked the blaster out of the hands of the first guard through, kicking his legs roughly out from under him. Tony shot at the two shoulder-to-shoulder behind them, Steve swinging, kicking, tripping.
Tony kept his eyes on Steve’s face, wondering distantly if there was some kind of rule for injury in the same way there was for thunder and lightning, some number of seconds in between dictating distance, severity.
Provided with Sharon Carter’s blood and hair samples, the machine was meant to — what, exactly? Pull on some kind of connection, retrieve—
They pushed closer and closer to him, more men with guns streaming out of the hall. His back hit the wall. Were it not for the low ceiling, the lack of space, he could have flown.
It felt almost reassuring, imagining it. Steve, he knew, hated him. Steve must have resented his choice, the decision, once more, to hurt for the sake of greater good. And Steve’s hatred, his disappointment—
Another scream, breathier, higher in the throat, easier on the vocal cords, and was he faking, or— was there—
Someone — a man— cried out in pain as he was knocked down, and another someone fired first at Tony’s abdomen — no damage, Extermis informed him — and then at Steve’s feet — ducked — Steve’s chest — ducked, but, no, blood— Tony had to shield his face, Steve was forcing one of the guards down onto the ground, someone grunted in pain, alarms on, Tony grabbed for a gun, trying to redirect, blood sprayed, someone was hit—
He swung back on his heels and forward into the wall, putting all his weight and momentum into the awkward angle. He could feel the moment that one of the ridges bent and gave under his weight, and caught himself on the wall to keep from falling, palms flat against the cold stone.
His footsteps echoed on the cement floor as he walked, slowly, back towards the trap door, Steve limp in his arms.
He couldn’t discount the other three, the ones which had mentioned SHIELD, Doom, and Captain America, he could not discount. He took a deep breath, knowing the risk of sinking too far under, of zoning out too long, and sank, slowly, back down.
Bones snapped back into place on his knee. People were picking him up, dragging him with hands underneath the armpits.
But that wasn’t not right. Cap was dead, really dead. Tony had sat with him in the crypt, touched his fingers to his skin, cold, stone-cold, crypt-cold. Tony had spoken to him, words designed to provoke, because back then he’d kind of felt like, if he found the right words, if he said something inflammatory enough, pathetic enough, important enough, Steve would have to get up and deal with him.
To his surprise, Steve sat up with a grunt of pain and reached over to set a hand lightly, on Tony’s elbow.
Steve was silent. Tony could hear his precise, controlled breaths, like he was counting out the seconds between inhale and exhale. 1-2-3, inhale, 4-5-6, exhale.
How long had Steve been awake, alive? How long did they intend to keep him so? Were they looking for work arounds, trying to find a way to put the Skull into his body anyways?
Steve glanced up at him, giving him an odd sort of look, concern mixing with an undertone of almost-amusement, almost-affection. He didn’t say anything, setting the little machine back down, and picked up the whip, looking it over dubiously. “My ex used to have something like that.”
“Don’t patronize—“ Sin started angrily, but he didn’t get the chance to hear the rest of the sentence. She swayed, suddenly, and fell forward, onto her knees.
“What?” He said. It came out breathy, high-pitched and panicked. One of the guards nudged him  in the back with the muzzle of his gun.
Tony couldn’t imagine the Red Skull (was it still the Red Skull? Had he succeeded?) could have anything but bad things planned for Steve.
He raised a hand, making it clear he was ready to shoot. Something about her posture, though, stopped him. She walked like a woman with a hidden weapon.
He pulled himself back out with a gasp, feeling like a man emerging suddenly from deep, dark waters. His head swam. The welcoming hum of words, of technology, was still there — he could sink into it, unsure he’d rise again.
“Yeah,” Tony said, dumbly, and reached over to set a hand on the side of Steve’s face. “I’m sorry to wake you.”
Steve picked up the heavy metal shelving again. Tony held the door shut, trying to find how the gas dispensers he’d seen operated. The system was tricky; it wasn’t his inability to break into it as much as his inability to find any piece of code that connected to it. Was it entirely manual, operated by levels and buttons and canisters?
In the nanosecond that followed, he could hear the whispers of machinery near him, Extremis blanketing his mind, opening channels once closed.
Tony closed his eyes and counted to ten. He could feel the lapping waves of noise encroaching on his mind, almost impossible to navigate without Extremis at full power.  He let them pull him down, bracing himself for the complete sensory overload.
In the armor, the top of his head brushed against the ceiling, almost un-maneuverable in the narrow tunnel.
Some treacherous, long forgotten part of his brain, the one that still imagined he worked on a team, suggested that Steve and Thor were going to have a hard time following him. Stung, Tony pushed the thought away.
Tony stared at him, wide-eyed, and then, hardly knowing what he was doing, he surged up, pulling Steve into a clingy, awkward embrace, one hand digging into Steve’s bicep, the other wrapped around his waist.
It was quite silly, he thought, to leave such a machine with a self-destruct button. Why did villains always go for it?
The question left him shocked, slow to come up with a response. He hadn’t expected Steve to talk. Out of the two of them, he was the talker — and yet, he’d been struck mute by the events, and Steve seemed to be cracking quips as dryly as, by all rights, Tony should have been.
Grateful that he was overdue for a manicure, Tony dug his sharp thumbnail into the rubber insulated surface of the wire, felt the thrum of electricity under his touch, and reared back before he could catch that particular electric shock.
This time, Tony jabbed against the meaty part of his shoulder. This time, he was braced for the scream, and he watched, feeling a sense of separation between him and the world, as Steve threw his head back, squeezed his eyes shut, as his jaw convulsed, once, mouth still open, as though biting down on an invisible gag.
Stream three: Doom. Here, Tony found files, transferred recently between computers, depicting the very same technology recently stolen from SHIELD. He felt a bit vindicated to learn it was Doomtech; if he had been so puzzled by regular Hydra fodder, he’d probably be a little offended.
He was dragging out time, he knew, both to give Steve a chance to breathe and because this couldn’t be over too quickly, but he knew they wouldn’t be satisfied with an electrical shock every few minutes. This needed to be bigger, flashier, more intense. This needed to be over.
The chains were tight enough that cuffs creaked as the sheet of golden metal slid under them. Aided, now, by the strength of the undersheath, Tony yanked forward, once, twice.
Somewhere very, very far away, Steve cleared his throat, and said, in a very small voice, “thank you, Tony, but I’m hoping that’s not going to be necessary.”
“By all means, talk. I’m wired, these days, to multitask.” Halfway into the system, not yet able to access the cameras, he could turn off the alarm, and did so.
And, simply put, he hadn’t had the time. He was balancing his company on top of his job as Director of SHIELD, on TV doing PR nearly every week, talking to agents, taking field reports, attending enough board meetings to be considered present in his company.
He wasn’t a consciousness drifting along hundreds of streams of data. He was Tony Stark, he remembered, in Tony Stark’s body.
He didn’t know how long the electricity had been on. With delicate, butterfly-light fingers, he reached up and probed at the ridges, feeling the place where they had bent.
Steve held his eyes for a moment, and then leaned in, pressing his lips to Tony’s. “We weren’t,” he said, when he pulled away again, “we won’t be.”
All was quiet, and Tony found he could no longer quite feel what his body was doing, if Extremis was still repairing him. The pain had lessened considerably, but remained.
They had done this on purpose, Tony remembered. He’d been considered too dangerous with the technopathy; if they were going to keep him around, likely to use as a bargaining chip with the agents who would inevitably follow him here, they needed it gone.
“I’m terrified,” Steve rumbled, sounding both sarcastic and tired, upset. Slightly emboldened, Tony bent down and jutted the prod out roughly at his thigh, activating the electricity with a button.
And through it, somewhere, he could feel Steve, drawing closer and closer as the mechanism worked. All he got were echoes, memories transposed into code and then re-translated by his brain, the shapes of emotion and action without whatever it was that made it feel true, but—
Steve moved slowly, deliberately, signaling his movements as he picked up the salt and tipped a liberal amount onto the palm of his hand. In the same manner, he made his way back to Tony and faced him, his back to the guards.
Well, he told himself, he was still in a better position than he’d been only a few minutes ago. At the very least, he knew where his armor was, and he maintained some sort of connection to the outside world, as tenuous as it was.
The first aid kit was stored, as always, just below the control panel. He pulled it out, sanitized his hands, hastily unwrapped half a roll of gauze, and shoved it into the bullet wound.
There came the sound of feet scuffing on the floor of the hallway floor. There was a dull thud — Steve’s shoulder, probably, against the hallway walls. And then the door was opening, and Steve was shoved through bodily by the guards. His hands were still cuffed behind him, shoulders held stiffly, uncomfortably behind him.
He glanced down and made another cut on Tony’s hipbone, smaller and shallower than the first. And then, even smaller, shier, onto the skin of his upper shoulder, not even nearing the muscle.
“Yes,” he said, sharp, brisk. “I was supposed to have backup, but I’m assuming my signals were intercepted or jammed.”
Tony stared at him, confused and a little concerned. He knew Steve was a churchgoer, but the spiritualism seemed out of character. “Like… the universe or the world or something?”
He had pulled Steve’s body out of the casket meant for the public funeral and into one of his own creation. Steve had been strangely light in his arms, strangely small, and ridiculously, impossibly dead.
Steve stapled his fingers together awkwardly, shifting from foot to foot. It was a small room. He didn’t seem to find anything to occupy his attention with. “I’ll be quiet. Let you focus.”
As the sun rose, they kissed, the brush of their lips gentle but charged, desperate. Tony trailed his hands down Steve’s abs, back towards his ribs, over the backs of his thighs, following the few lines of unbroken, unbruised skin on his body. Steve took him by the waist and pulled close, tangling their legs together, his muscular thigh pressed tight against Tony’s groin. Suddenly there was nothing but feeling, tight and hot, each part of his body lighting up where Steve touched him, where he touched Steve — his legs, his sides, the palms of his hands, his cock, which Steve was now stroking with a deft, firm grip…
For a moment, Steve stood there, almost seeming to sway a little in his indecision, but a glance at the muzzle of the gun still pressed to Tony’s temple seemed to convince him to stay true to his word.  Slowly, he stepped over to the rack of torture equipment, looking it over. His lips thinned.
Pain reverberated in his legs and shoulder as he was roughly thrown, roughly, onto the covered stone floor. A new voice, female and more commanding than any of the ones before it, joined the fray.
Tony was seated, now, at the grand desk of the Director, surrounded by state of the art technology, by men ready to spring into action at a single word, his suit ready to materialize around him at a stray thought, faster, stronger, smarter than he’d ever been before, and he longed for the days when a closely constructed heavy chestplate had been the only thing keeping him breathing.
The first shot rang through the room, bouncing harmlessly off the side of Tony’s metal-clad head. Steve had the good sense to duck, for once in his life, diving under the metal shelving.
The tracker was telling him that the stolen technology was close, the signal stronger than ever. Tony activated the night vision feature on his helmet, assessing the underground base in which he’d found himself. He found he was standing in the middle of a narrow, circular hallway, the ceiling so low that if he took one step to the left or to the right, the top of his head would touch it. There were uninsulated mysterious wires running back along metal bracers. Just by them, long, perforated boxes indicating some means of dispensing gas. It was almost classic supervillain, and Tony was well protected from it; his armor filtered the air it allowed through the air holes. In places like this, he’d often been the only teammate not to succumb to poisonous fumes.
It was nearly nighttime when he arrived at his destination. A warm, humid dusk had settled over the coastal landscape, the last rays of sun near-purple through the clouds. The only place Tony could land, even in the little military jet, was a clearing two miles away from his destination, and this suited him fine; he didn’t plan to announce his arrival.
When he opened his eyes, Tony wasn’t sure how much time passed. He was half conscious, a strange, near-overheated kind of brain tired. He knew, a bone deep kind of knowledge, that he’d done what he’d set out to do, and that came with its own sort of satisfaction. They’d kill him, he knew, if they found out it’d been him who interfered. Shortsighted as they were, Hydra would be happy to surrender their bargaining chip with SHIELD for revenge. And Steve—
No guards remained standing. A few were on the ground, almost certainly dead. Most were on the ground, injured or unconscious. The rest were on the ground, disarmed, watching them, but not daring, not willing, to try their chances again.
He remembered the little nod, the way Steve’s eyes had followed him, the breathy, high pitched scream, and felt unsettled to his very bones. He’d seen something he wasn’t meant to have seen.
His newfound awareness, newfound knowledge, clued him in: Steve. Somehow, despite it all — despite the way the blood had gushed, red and wild, sputtering with each heartbeat like a broken hose, pump, the flow ebbing with the pressure, out of the wound just under his neck, despite the stiffness of his jaw, his hands, his wrists, despite the too pale skin, cold and yielding like skin on a chicken, on meat, in the crypt, despite the half closed eyes, dim, clumpy blond eyelashes, dirty face, unshaven, Jesus Christ, get up, Steve, what the hell kind of anticlimax is this, it’s not ending here, Steve, please, despite the blood under the fingers, on the muzzle of the gun — it was about Steve. They’d tethered Steve to the device they’d now recovered from SHIELD, tethered him in time, alive and dead at once, bound by the DNA of his lover and would-be murderer, and Tony was here to witness a resurrection.
But he longed to fly. Extremis meant he could keep emailing in the suit, could fill out paperwork at the speed of thought. He was faster, stronger, and better equipped than anyone working for him.
“Find a way to cut the technopathy,” it said, “or kill him. He’s too dangerous to keep around otherwise.”
Steve held his eyes for a moment, assessing, swaying on his feet as though ready to try to make a break for it anyhow. Tony must have sounded like he had a plan.
Despite everything, Tony hadn’t expected him to scream. He felt the sound deep in his gut, an almost-embarrassed guilt flaring dramatically up, a pervading sense of
“I’d like to see you watch him bleed out,” Sin suggested. “I would like to release the lovely footage I took. I would like you to be blamed for his death. It won’t be anything new, will it?”
He thought he heard something tear. A second jolt of pain from his shoulder hit him at the same time as a sharper, more intense one from his neck.
The Red Skull was there, and Tony could feel him, lines of computer code in an artificial, robotic body. He’d been killed, Tony knew, by Sharon, but he supposed this wouldn’t be his first resurrection. He’d lost so much along the way, stubbornly clinging onto life anyways, and Tony had to wonder if it was worth it, how desperate the man must be for the fresh start with Steve’s skin.
He thought of leaving flowers at the memorial, by the statue, but the thought felt as empty as he knew the coffin underneath to be. He could have gone to the real burial site in the Arctic ocean, could have sat on the ice by the water and imagined Steve, frozen and unharmed, underneath the waves.
They were both bleary with exhaustion, warm and clean for the first time in days. It suddenly seemed no question at all that they would sleep in Tony’s bed.
Slowly, he felt along the floor of the empty cell with his foot, combing for any pieces of rock or metal he could use as tools. When nothing surfaced, he felt along the edge of the wall until he found the door by running his fingers over the sharp, square corners of the doorway.
One of the guards cleared her throat, nudging Tony again with the muzzle of the semi-automatic. Steve’s crumbled once more into the anxious, angry mask.
“Uh, no,” Tony said. Somewhere behind them, a faint hissing sounded, and he shuffled his feet against the cement to try to distract her from the noise. “It wouldn’t.”
“Collar,” he mouthed, indicating it with a downward jut of his chin, and then let out a pained little whimper to hide the fact that he’d talked at all.
They hadn’t even talked. It hit Tony suddenly that he didn’t even say hello — though the idea of saying hello, in this setting, seemed kind of laughable— that he had done nothing in terms of communication, hadn’t taken advantage of the opportunity allowed to them.
He tried to push himself back into the fray, to try to overhear any other communications, feel any other processes. His head ached. Nothing came, the collar combining with Tony’s pain, his exhaustion, to block any signal. He could no longer feel even the armor, though he knew where it was.
Nothing cutting, Tony decided, looking for the row of knives, scalpels, and shears. He knew his way around the human body, had had to trust himself, several times in his life, to perform surgery with very little equipment. And so he knew exactly how costly one mistake, one hand tremor, could be.
“The gas,” Tony said. “Knock out gas. The dispensers were online after all. I just had to figure it out. I just had to get closer to the base.”
For a few moments, leaning heavily against the door, he felt nothing but overwhelming relief. The pain had gone. He wasn’t dying, not now.
It wasn’t enough. The cacophony of rays, though imprecise, was impossible to avoid. Molten metal dripped down his leg, on the inside of the armor, now, the hole gaping in his thigh. Tony gasped, recoiled, stumbled, trying in vain to escape the burn.
The six month anniversary of Captain America’s death came and went without Tony noticing the date. He’d never been good at keeping track of dates, but he’d registered every single one before that — one week that Steve had been gone. One month. Three months.
He took a deep breath, set his hands down flat on the floor around him as though to steady himself, and closed his eyes, listening.
The tracker showed the missing technology had been taken out the base in DC and down to Virginia, a location by Chesapeake Bay which satellite information told him contained nothing but dense, swampy wood. It’d be down to him, he supposed, to see the truth of the information he was working with.
Tony realized he couldn’t estimate even roughly how much time had passed since he’d first come down into the underground base. It could not have been long — they must have been in the process of setting up the machine when he’d arrived,— but… hours? Days?
Steve’s hands did not shake. That wasn’t surprising; the serum, generally, left Steve a steadier man than Tony. His face, still, was set, but his eyes darted wildly around the room, landing, on Tony’s face, as though he expected an out before this would begin.
He could adjust the settings of the thing, and, automatically, he almost set it to the lowest setting. Then, a realization settled on him, and he slid the dial back around.
But something about them made him recognize Steve immediately, and, unable to help himself, he drew closer, seemed to call out—
But to transpose computer code into the human body seemed almost an impossibility, especially a body already governed by a mind of its own. Perhaps if—
“He wants him walking,” she reminded him, and turned back to Tony, gesturing with her semi automatic, “you— walk.”
He was letting errors add up, deleting what lines he could, short circuiting what he could reach in the limbs, and then, quite suddenly, he realized he hadn’t needed to.
When he woke up for the second time, Steve was already dressed. Tony’s workout clothes looked a little tight on him. The hood of a grey sweatshirt was pulled over his head.
Were they trying to draw forth a version of Steve from before his death? Had they meant to place something — someone? — into the body of Steve from years past, Steve in the ice, Steve at twenty-five, Steve with his blue eyes wide and pretty and naive, still, Steve from the glory days of the team, who still smiled like he’d just bought his dimples and wanted to show them off, Steve from just a few years ago, a little worn down, a little more skeptical, but a Steve who still believed in them, believed in Tony, Steve who—
“Urgh,” he said, eloquently, rubbing at his jaw with a hand. Two guards, clad head to toe in black uniforms, were standing framed by pale light in the doorway. Automatically, Tony catalogued their blasters, their stances.
Steve pushed himself up on his elbows with a wet sort of squelch, clotted blood spilling liberally out of the wound as he bent at the waist.
Tony’s hands shook badly as he picked up the smallest of the scalpels on display, his eyes fixed on the metal shelving. The possibility of suicide crossed his mind. The possibility of murder, of keeping Steve out of Hydra’s hands, allowing him to be free, crossed his mind.
Steve settled back, shifted his weight, and turned to look at the guards. His face was set with a grim, angry sort of determination which was not entirely unfamiliar to Tony — he’d spent months staring into Steve’s angry, grim face— but there was a coldness to the steel, a rigidity that scared him.
He slid his hand down Tony’s body, dusting the salt off on his threadbare pants before it could do any damage, and—
He had failed to make use of the limited time they’d had together. He hadn’t said anything of value. He hadn’t apologized. He hadn’t explained. They’d been so close, on the same side again, shoulder to shoulder in the little torture room, and all they had talked about were plans, particulars. The last things Steve had said to him were
He pushed up, away from the table, away from Steve, folding his arms around himself, and stared at the floor, trying to calm down.
He would have preferred to fly the suit all the way over, but the technology stolen had been bulky, and he expected that he’d be taking suspects back in. The jet he took, digitized to be flown by AI, responded easily to a light touch of his mind and took flight, soaring through the air at speeds that didn’t quite rival the armor. Still, something about this was satisfying; Tony longed to leave home base behind him.
Stop faltering, he told himself, be predictable. Give him something to expect and he’ll be able to roll with it. He’d been through worse. He had to have been through worse.
He wasn’t sure if he came or if he was coming apart, falling into Steve with a strangled little moan, clutching at him. Steve pulled him close into his warm, solid chest and held him there, and Tony thought he mumbled something stupid, something along the lines of
He was exhausted. There was nothing he could do, Tony thought desperately, wildly, he had to stop here, leave things here, but—
Last resort, he decided, and felt up to the antennas. They were rigid and solid, unyielding under his hands even with how thin they were. He pushed and whacked at them randomly, trying to bend or snap anything, and found them immovable, solid.
Finally, the suit barreled into the room. It looked much worse for wear after the damage it had taken but fully functional. Tony could control it through the undersheath without wearing it, and that was the easiest, fastest way to pilot. The suit  grabbed one of the guards by the scruff of his neck, tossing him bodily into the hall with a sick crunch, fired at the woman shooting at Steve. It knocked  her down and shoved a guard out into the hall to follow his mate.
He was pale, clammy. Tony couldn’t tell if he was breathing. He remembered peeling off his gauntlets in the crypt, remembered the stains on the white stripes of the uniform, bright candy red in the center, rusting and drying on the edges. No time had passed, but he was sure, somehow, that if he took his gauntlets off now, Steve would be just as cold to the touch as he had been in the crypt.
For a while, his brain seemed full of guilt and noise, numbed and deadened by the events that had taken place. Then came the overwhelming urge to plan, to calculate, to
His fingers didn’t shake when he flicked the power down one notch, to the second-highest intensity. Steve stared at him, expressionless.
He remembered the woman closing something around his neck, and reached up, feeling the uneven weight that had settled there. It was a heavy metallic collar, its edges spiked with small, antenna-like ridges. Tony slipped his fingers under the edge, felt the bundle of wires underneath, ran his finger along the rounded metal without finding the lock.
But Steve, Tony remembered, had never been a fan of fireworks, his ears too accustomed to the artillery fire of the war which had given rise to Captain America. Steve had never liked the cold. Steve had never liked the ocean.
Tony, on the left, pointed his hands outwards towards the door, while Steve took the right, the metal shelving raised.
But then he was throwing himself, every part of himself, into turning the machine off, wrecking the code.
Tony fed her a greatly modified version of events — he’d gone, he said, been captured, and fought his way out. He was wounded. He expected back-up here, busting the terror cell, within the hour.  They’d find he’d done much of the work for them, but he was going home.
Steve stepped forward, his eyes roaming over Tony’s chained form. Tony could tell that he was thinking — he, too, was running through the places where the most superficial wounds could be made without real damage.
He discounted the numbers and equations right away; he knew that, without the larger picture, he wouldn’t be able to act on them. He retraced the source of those feeds,  muted them in his mind, and returned to the rest.
“You can undo the cuffs,” Steve said, gruffly, breaking off Tony’s catastrophizing thoughts with a reminder that very real pain was coming. “I’ll do it.”
Stream two: Captain America. For the first time, looking through the files, Tony felt genuine dread, genuine shock, genuine horror curdling in the pit of his stomach. Someone on the Hydra base had been putting together a folder, full of audio recordings and video tapes of Cap, notes on his mannerisms, his way of speaking, his posture. It had been sent recently from one device to another, to which a response had come:
His hands were forced into hanging handcuffs, feet kicked out from under him until he was kneeling. Numb, he didn’t resist.
Perhaps they were about to show him Steve’s body. Perhaps they were about to torture Steve in front of him. Perhaps they’d use him, somehow, to hurt Steve, though he doubted that would do much good. Steve, he remembered well, had died hating him.
He was putting Steve into an awkward position. He was forcing this naked, vulnerable display of emotion on Steve, who had just come from the war, from the fight, who had fought Tony in the streets just days before. It wasn’t fair to put this on him. It wasn’t fair to do this.
And then, just as he could feel Steve returning, the Skull’s robotic mind gained dominance in the picture once more, following Steve down into the body.Tony pivoted, changed course, and, using the last of Extremis’s power, the very last strength remaining in his mind, he  slammed the passage shut.
The flood of men, some of whom had quickly figured out the situation and started trying to shoot into the room without advancing — sometimes hitting their own — closed on them so fast Tony stopped trying to keep track of the individual fates of their assailants and focused on the flow of shooting, kicking, punching, hitting.
“I know,” Steve said, softly. It was only days ago for him, Tony remembered. The last conversation they’d had, before Steve’s death, he’d been shouting insults, locked in a prison cell on the helicarrier. Steve had asked—
Tony stared at her, calculating. This time, when he raised his hands, it was in an appeasing sort of gesture. “Alright, let’s— let’s talk about how we can get that done, yeah?”
) and powered up the suit, feeling a familiar comfort settle over him along with the metal. It was always easier to be Iron Man, tracking down those deserving of justice, than it was to be Tony Stark, alone and brooding over details over a memorial service no one could possibly enjoy.
He couldn’t even think about it. Steve, headstrong, determined, his own man to the end, being puppeted around like that. It didn’t bear thinking about.
To ordinary human eyes, the smaller clearing where the last known location of the tracker had brought him would have looked empty. Tony’s scanners, though, immediately brought him forward towards the little protruding hunk of metal, carefully obscured by mud. There was an underground bunker here.
expression. He caught him by the shoulder, stepping once more in front of him, and asked quickly, “What do you want?”
“I’m sorry,” Tony said, again, still unable to get a hold of himself, still crying, “I’m sorry, it was never supposed to— I never wanted it to— Cap, I never meant—“
Limping heavily down the hallway, Tony tried to brace himself for anything that could possibly happen, imagined the worst possibilities, imagined Steve slaughtered in a million different ways, imagined Steve hurt, Steve screaming at him, cursing him out, everything he could say, every true thing they could have told him, every false one, and, somehow, he tricked himself into feeling like he could face it.
No sooner had Tony had the thought that he was feeling the machine, understanding its clever little trappings. It was Doomtech at its most Doomtech — messy, disorienting, counterintuitive to anyone like Tony, anyone whose mind naturally desired order, efficiency, and, underneath it all, genius. The machine had only just been activated, and Tony’s thoughts swirled with its strange, cyclical pull.
Whoever these people were, they outnumbered him, and they were surrounding him. Tony hoped the darkness of the hallway, which he saw through easily with the aid of his helmet, would give him an advantage.
“There are explosives by the exit,” she said, “wired to me by a dead man’s switch. If you shoot me, you’ll collapse the whole tunnel. You’ll trap yourself.”
“Six months,” said Tony, now unwilling to meet his eye. Some part of him still felt a pang of guilt at having missed the date, the vigils. Some part of him felt that Steve would know. “Six months a couple days ago.”
Stream one, which he could now distinguish was another real-time exchange, was concerned with measures taken to prevent SHIELD from following him down too quickly. He’d seen straight through the camouflage on the entrance to the bunker, and it seemed workers were modifying it, trying to make it harder to find him. Fine. Mute.
“Nothing burst. I’ll be good as new in a couple weeks,” Steve told him, confident and easy, “the serum will take care of it.”
“It wasn’t worth it,” he said, repeating the mantra he’d said in the crypt. “It was never worth it.”
A beeping from the radio on the control panel interrupted them. Shakily, Tony let go of his hand and stood, reading the signal.
To his surprise, the blood was warm, sticky. Steve didn’t reach to the push at all, his head lolling back against the table with a faint little thud.
He wasn’t going to try that again, if only because he didn’t know if he could survive another shock.
Well. To say Tony passed out would be inaccurate. Finding himself unable to resist, he retreated back into himself, into the artificial cavern created in his mind by Extremis. He focused, now, on nothing but survival.
The scene devolved rapidly into chaos. His were shots quicker and deadlier than theirs, but the repulsor blasts mostly glanced off the riot shields, leaving the smell of burning plastic in the air and the soldiers unharmed. Their guns fired laser-like glowing rays, blinding, and Tony found that a well aimed shot could melt the joints of his armor, the first holes starting to form around the chest, the legs.
For a long moment, they held each other’s eyes. Steve was breathing heavily, pale and winded, his uniform blood splattered. Tony was sure he couldn’t look much better. No one spoke. Then, they spoke at once.
How long would it take for the lack of food and water to begin to affect them? How long could they survive? Were they meant to see each other again?
The action reverberated, sending echoes hurtling through space, and for a second Tony thought Steve wouldn’t make it either, pushed back by the closer passage.
The third cut was lower, going into the scant layer of fat just over Tony’s hip, and it hurt less. Distracted by Steve’s hand, Tony barely had the presence of mind to loll forward, exaggerating the pain and groan.
He stumbled, and this time he couldn’t catch himself, falling back against the wall. A second blast hit him just over his left collarbone, a third just under his knee. He fired blindly, now, his raised hands sending men careening back into the other wall. He was bleeding out quickly, already woozy, and he could feel Extremis pulling at the edges of his consciousness, cataloguing the damage. Severed femoral. Fractured collarbone. Bruised fibula, cartilage damage around the knee. Given time, Extremis could repair it all, put him back together. Already it was redirecting blood flow away from the area, compensating for the blood loss.
He cloaked the jet, cut nonessential lines of communication, and followed the call of the tracker. The ground under his feet was treacherous, swampy mug and tangled, uneven tree root, and he found it easier to take to the air and soar several feet over the ground, counting on the trees to mask his arrival.
They needed this to start. Now, the Hydra guards would be more cautious than at any other time, waiting for Cap to chicken out, to change his mind.
For a moment, he couldn’t breathe. He screamed, convulsing, his nails digging cruelly into the flesh of his hands, kicked out wildly, his feet hitting something, yelled again, words this time,
His expression set, Steve stayed silent. Tony knew there wasn’t, really, anything he could say, but he found himself wishing desperately for another cue, for anything at all.
He could feel the humid air well, now, even through his faceplate. It was much colder below the swamp than it had been above it, and the air smelled stale, rotten, full of bacteria.
Steve held the scalpel like a pencil, his hand so low on the hilt that his fingers almost brushed against the blade. He glanced up again at Tony, meeting his eyes, and Tony couldn’t help the little bubble of frustration bubbling up in the pit of his stomach.
Steve was close enough, now, that Tony could have leaned forward and touched him even with the chains binding him to the wall. The temptation to whisper now and  convey a message was overwhelming.
In the darkness, the movement was dizzying. Twice, he bumped against the cement wall with his  face or head, uncertain on his feet. And then, finally—
Tony had many men he could delegate this task to. Teams of men, even. It would make more sense to have them in the field than him.
At least the walls were solid cement. No chance of them trying to blast through there, not without compromising the structural integrity of the already thin bunker.
It never hurt to try, so Tony rotated the lock, running through the usual: 1-2-3-4, 1-1-1-1, 0-0-0-0, 8-9-1-0, 2-0-0-1. None of them gave results, which he expected, and Tony raised a hand, firing up a repulsor beam, a single precise shot to melt the locking mechanism without doing any damage to the structure.
For a few moments, he sat, letting his heart slow, shivering slightly in the chilly air — the sweat-soaked pants let him colder, perhaps, than being naked — and let himself wallow in self-loathing, self-pity.
The position his hands were chained in made it hard to gesture, but he made a valiant attempt, folding his fingers together in a rough sort of
He realized that he was still hearing the distant whisper of technology around him. He could feel his armor, fully assembled and empty several rooms away from him, and when he reached for it with his mind, it didn’t heed his call.
The next set of guards were armed with only semi-automatics. Tony took out the first one with a blast to the shoulder, feeling a sick, swooping feeling of relief. The camera feed told him there weren’t more incoming, and if they could take down—
Steve cleared his throat. It was a strange sound, far too banal for the setting, too normal. When he spoke, his voice was sharp, rough with disuse. Distantly, Tony wondered if he still tasted crypt-dust.
This time, Tony’s yelp of pain was genuine. He groaned sharply, canting away from the touch as best he could, but Steve’s warm, calloused, cruel hand caught the side of his neck, keeping him still, and—
Once more, desperately, he tried to reach out to his armor. Again, he felt it, still and assembled, in the same building, probably only rooms away, and yet it remained out of reach, impossible to summon to himself.
He was vaguely aware that he’d crumpled against the wall, that there were hands on him. Someone yanked his helmet off in one clean, jagged gesture, someone was saying, “the man himself.,” Ssomeone pressed fingers under his chin, checking for pulse, and Tony—
He was somewhere dark, and his eyes struggled to adjust without the helmet’s visors; he could tell the room was small but made out no details, nothing but the general shape of the walls. His shoulder, thigh, and knee ached, though nowhere nearly as badly as they had. Distantly, he could hear machines buzz.
He stared down at the scalpel, contemplating the idea of trying to sever nerve endings, and then discarded it. His hands were shaking horribly. Even with the serum, he couldn’t guarantee he wouldn’t do any lasting damage.
Steve was strung up by chains attached to heavy metal cuffs on his wrists, and already looking exhausted, out of breath. He was kneeling with his arms suspended above his head. The gunshot wounds were gone, but Tony recognized the uniform; it had been the one Steve had died in, and it bore the same tatters, the same grime, built up from weeks of living on the run.
Steve stared at him like he was an idiot, but didn’t seem to come up with the words to tell him so. He seemed paler by the minute, leaning heavily against the wall.
But then again, Tony realized, Steve thought that he had a plan. He was looking for cues, for something to work off of. And Tony—
“Stay out of the way!” Tony shouted at him, sprinting to try to get himself between the guards and Steve. They weren’t armed to take down Iron Man, now. In the undersheath, Tony was mostly shielded from the gunfire.  If they could wait for the Iron Man suit to arrive (forty-eight seconds, Tony counted, for it to assemble itself and make its way through the corridors), he could take out the guards with their semi-automatics in seconds. If Steve just stayed
A shot rang out. Someone screamed in pain, a muffled, strangled sort of noise. Many shots were ringing out, and the screaming was not entirely new. At first, Tony hadn’t noticed that it had been Steve.
“Stay back,” he said, sharply, as his repulsors whirred to life, glowing threateningly, more of a display than an actual necessity, “this is your only warning.”
“When I was…” he started, but didn’t seem to find the words, “… when I was dead. Gone. Whatever I was. I saw—“
All he knew was that Steve’s chapped, cool lips were on his, his mouth tasting of blood and dust, and then they weren’t.
Tony stared at him, taken aback and disbelieving. Then, a moment late, he took Steve’s offered hand and laced their fingers together. His eyes traced Steve’s hunched, wounded form, the sharp planes of his muscles, the dirt clinging to his skin, the stubble, and landed on his warm, deep blue eyes.
He opened his eyes, blinking, already feeling better, stronger, fresher than before. It wouldn’t be long until the cuts were closing, and he needed to be out of the chains by then.
There was something desperate to the second kiss, something pushy. It didn’t last. Steve straightened up, glanced at Tony one last time, and then he was gone, leaving behind nothing but his tattered, bloody uniform.
It was a strange decision. She tried to talk him into staying long enough to meet the backup, to watch the bunker. She tried to talk him into heading for SHIELD medbay instead of his tower.
Well. Steve was still held captive. The most likely outcome for him was death, a slower and more painful one than the one he’d just returned from. If not, well.
“I can’t hurt you again,” Tony's voice broke, “this can’t happen again. I can’t believe they made us do it again.”
“— it’s just a dream,” Steve said, looming out of the half darkness. The first rays of sunrise, red gold, hit his blond hair from behind, giving him a faint, halo-like glow. “I’m okay.”
He hadn’t. He was scared, he supposed, of what he’d find, picturing skeletal hands coming out from underneath the waves, picturing decomposition, or, perhaps just Steve, somehow whole and unharmed and breathing and cold and angry.
It was a reasonable question. He’d asked once before. Tony could close his eyes and picture it vividly, Steve over him, shield raised, his own voice, begging —
“Well,” he said to Steve, who was frozen and watching him, when Tony  screamed, “don’t stop on my account.”
Tony, breathing air filtered through the mask of the suit, turned to catch Steve before he, too, fell. He had pitched backwards, and so it had only been natural to catch him bridal style, but now Tony worried about hurting him, about agitating the wound.
Had it been a day? Was that how they’d done it, one of these ghastly scenes a day? Or had they only waited for Cap to come to?
The golden undersheath slid smoothly over Tony’s skin. He could finally feel the pieces of the armor where they’d taken from him, stacked in the storage room above them.
Tony caught him by the back of the neck and kept him a moment longer. “Stay in touch. Take— take more, take cash.”
For a moment, Tony could not think, could not breathe, didn’t even process the pain enough to want it to stop. Then, the pain was everything he was aware of. He clawed uselessly at his neck, tried to pull at the collar. He might have screamed.
The shock had subsided. Steve’s wrists, already worn down by him yanking at the chain, were streaming fresh rivulets of blood, running down his arm and pooling on the wrinkled skin at his elbows. His chest rose and fell in fast, deep, don’t-panic breaths of a cornered, wounded animal. He was flushed, the pink dots on his cheeks inappropriately boyish.
They tossed him back into the cell where he’d been kept. He stumbled, fell, and didn’t even bother to get up.
Except, of course, Hydra didn’t want Steve back. They wanted Steve’s body, alive and breathing, with the Red Skull in the driver’s seat.
At some point, he had slid down the wall, sitting with his back pressed against the door. Sharp, concrete-y dust clung to his sweat-soaked skin; the floor had been ridiculously dirty. Warm blood trickled down his neck where he’d torn it open with his nails, startlingly wet. He was out of breath, his heart thudding frantically and a little irregularly against his ribcage.
He had to stay alive. He had to get the collar off. He had to get them out of there. His jet — if it hadn’t been found yet — would be nearby. He’d been outnumbered, the first time, but now he’d been able to grasp the layout of the bunker which surrounded them, and the guards had traded the blasters they had employed against his suit for regular semi-automatics (for economy’s sake, Tony presumed).
He’d been left unchained. The undersheath was gone, having retreated, for reasons unclear to him, back into the hollows of his bones.
During a prison break of several important captured terrorists, a broken Hydra machine of unknown purpose, extracted from the field by Agent Sharon Carter about a month previously, has been stolen from SHIELD storage, along with blood samples from several agents. No one knew exactly why these things had been taken, or by whom. A tracker installed on the confiscated tech had worked until several hours ago.
Steve had the last guard down on the ground, and Tony directed the suit to grab him and the one he’d just shot to the floor, sending both of them out of the room as well.
“Not great,” Tony said. He just had to keep her talking, he told himself. He had just had to go along with it. “I wouldn’t feel great.”
It didn’t sit right with Tony, but by the time they were landing on the roof of his tower, Steve’s color returned to him. He looked steadier, calmer. Tony insisted on helping him out of the jet, on sitting him down on one of the clean chairs in his penthouse and fishing the bullet out with clean tweezers. The bleeding had stopped completely by then.
It wouldn’t be long, now. Tony could feel them pulling at the connection, exploring it, plugging Carter’s hair and blood into the appropriate places.
His eyes watered, and he blinked rapidly, staring at Steve with betrayal, confusion, thinking for a moment that this whole time Steve had wanted to hurt him, had meant it, was relishing in it, and—
Never before had Tony felt so alone, and though it wasn’t just Steve’s death that had left him here — for the first time in years, he didn’t have his team, barely had time for social interaction of any kind — it was easy to blame on the war, on Steve’s death.
He led Steve into the master bathroom, intending to leave him there, but then the spray was on, and Steve was stripping, and Tony was still there, and so he stayed to rinse the cuts on Steve’s wide, muscular back, to work the dirt free from the fine hairs on the back of his neck.
One of the guards — there were four for Steve — stepped forward and pressed the muzzle of his gun to Tony’s temple. He didn’t flinch away, staring.
His mind, finally, buzzed with activity. He filled out travel paperwork, kept a mental eye out on the digital tracker from the stolen tech, just in case its signal surfaced once more, piloted the plane, answered any and all incoming questions from agents and staff. Aided by Extremis, he could stuff his mind so full that no space remained for anxiety, for worry, for grief. Part of him felt like he was designed for this, like this was how he’d been meant to be all along. Before, he told himself, he’d just left too much space in his mind, and so the worries and the insecurities and the sadness took hold.
The interior furnishings were sparse, and, after a moment of deliberation, he set Steve down on the long, thin map table in the center of the cabin.
Steve’s throat bobbed as he swallowed, though his voice still sounded dry when he spoke. “Bring your worst.”
Tony closed his eyes, braced himself, and dove back into the sea of information around him. His own goal was to find anything, anywhere, that he could pull at. A message he could send, a system he could sabotage, anything, anything at all.
He was only bleeding from a few spots — the first a shallow wound on his leg, most likely inflicted in a tussle with one of the guards, the result of a blaster shot, and then a long, shallow cut over his forehead.  Then there were his wrists, rubbed raw from pulling on the chains, whole strips of skin peeling off with the uniform.
Slowly, already telling himself that he had no other choice, already feeling he’d made the wrong choice, he took a step forward.
Nothing had happened yet. Most likely, they intended for one of them to watch. Tony had been preparing himself for this, had expected this.
“How would you feel knowing that you’d had the chance to fix it all and squandered it? How would you feel knowing you killed Cap, again?”
There was the dull pain in his knee, the sharper one in his collar bone, the prickling of the burns, half healed by Extremis. There was the cold, the sweat, the fabric clinging hard to bare skin. There was the crust in the corners of his eyes, the hair clinging to his forehead.
“Oh, yeah,” Steve said, turning to face him. Their eyes met. For a moment, the whip dangled, limp and forgotten in his hands.
Steve said, or thought, or both, sounding just as he always had, the low rumble of his voice carrying somehow through the code, and Tony wanted to answer him. I’m here, I’m here, he wanted to say, but he wasn’t.
Automatically, he pulled himself to his feet and reached out with his mind to probe at the machines, at any line of communication, and—
“Do you want that?” Steve asked, raggedly, and that seemed like a strange question to Tony. Of course they wanted it. They wanted to see them suffer, to hurt them for the trouble they’d caused, the plans they’d foiled, to have footage— for whatever reason — of the pain, the torture. They wanted them dead. They didn’t care—
This time, when Steve bent down to kiss him, it was deliberate, careful. His jaw was smooth. He smelled of mouthwash and Tony’s shaving cream.
Steve’s expression of concern was harder to to deal with than anything else. He didn’t seem to know how to proceed. “Those look— are you—“
“I can’t.” This, too, seemed simple now but promised consequences soon. “But we need to get you to a hospital.”
Pain, sharp and despite everything surprising, bloomed in his ribs. Liquid, sticky and slow, followed behind it. And, last in the procession, came a realization: Steve had glanced up at him to warn him.
Tony slipped out of bed and watched the street out of the window. Thousands of feet below him, a little figure in a grey sweatshirt stepped out of the lobby and disappeared into the morning crowd.
Despite it all, he knew he’d saved Steve from a worse fate, that he had, finally, done right by him. Even if they didn’t leave this situation, he knew Steve would choose death over what had been in store for him.
He’s hurt. He doesn’t want this. He hates you. You’re ugly and awful and you’re crying. You look pathetic. He thinks you’re pathetic.
His first shot seemed to bounce, richotting oddly off the gleaming metal, but he adjusted his fingers and tried again, shooting once more. This time, something inside gave a drawn-out, painful kind of creak and, when Tony applied pressure, the trap door opened.
He glanced up, meeting Tony’s eyes. Tony wished, desperately, for his helmet, for anything, for an executioner’s hood, even.
Tony hadn’t been enough. Not in arranging the service, not in remembering the half-anniversary of the death, not in protecting the Steve that had been dragged back into life. How stupid could he have been to feel accomplished, to feel like he’d done anything at all right?
The mechanism had to be somewhere in the antennas and the wires. He was barefoot, his feet cold on the concrete floor, the sole of one foot already scratched.
Steve cut again, another shallow cut on his ribs, just underneath the first. This time, the force of it — the scalpel, Tony realized, was dull— pulled hard at Tony’s skin, reopening the cut above it, and he inhaled sharply, crowding back against the wall to avoid the top layer of stinging pain and the dull one underneath.
The first blast from one of the blasters pierced through the door. “I can’t get to it,” Tony snapped, feeling the structure of the door give under his fingers, “They’re coming in.”
Steve glanced down, bent his knees to come closer, alarmed. Tony glanced up and momentarily met his eye.
Tony came to sluggishly, feeling as though his head had been encased in a block of clear, not-quite-cold gelatin.
“I’ll be fine,” Steve said. He’d pulled out a bottle of bright blue Powerade from the first aid kit, and he waved it at Tony, the brightly colored liquid sloshing out over the lip. “I’m hydrating.”
There were twenty of them, eight on one side and twelve on the other, armored heavily in dark green kevlar, wielding unfamiliar-looking guns and long, reflective riot shields.
He’d wanted it to be over. He’d wanted it to be over, and he’d let himself run on automatic. He had thought he was being clever. He’d thought he was outsmarting them, having the picana on the lowest setting. He’d thought he could fake it.
Steve’s eyes lingered a moment too long on the collar, but, thankfully, he had the good sense not to react immediately.
