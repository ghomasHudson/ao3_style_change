Dean grunts, eyeing him warily for a moment. “You need something?”
“Not that this isn’t adorable,” Charlie pipes up “but can we get back to the presents?”
Cas frowns, seeming confused as he says, “Why not?”
Not long after that, they’re back on the road again to their second destination for the day – a petting zoo in Lincoln. It’s an almost two-hour drive out from the museum, but it’s worth it when they let the kids loose to go play with the animals.
Sam heads over to the kitchen after what he feels was a reasonable amount of time. He knows better than to get in the middle of a long-overdue talk-slash-argument (it could go either way knowing the both of them), but it’s best for everybody involved if he pops in there to help with the inevitable damage control after.
Parking the car in front of the bunker’s entrance, Sam gets out and gently nudges the kids awake and out of the car. He ushers them into the bunker, closing the door behind him with a quiet, solid thud. He heads down the stairs, stopping next to the map table when he realizes the kids aren’t behind him. Confused, he looks around, only to find the kids still up on the landing, staring in wide-eyed fascination down at the war room. He rolls his eyes, a small smile playing at his lips as he wanders into the library, listening for any sounds of Kevin’s presence in the bunker. He hears two sets of light footsteps behind him as the kids finally clamber down the stairs, but nothing else. Climbing the two steps into the library proper, he calls out, “Kevin! Kev, you here?!”
“Regardless, this is man’s natural state.”
“And if it doesn’t work?” With an expression like he doesn’t expect Sam to agree, he adds, “You gonna keep Cas busy?”
“I’ve narrowed it down to a few things, but short of actually touching them we don’t know which one’s causing it. So far it doesn’t seem to be dangerous, but obviously that’s not something to take a chance on.”
He turns to leave, before deciding he can risk two seconds to leave one parting remark. “Maybe take your celebration somewhere else though like, oh,
“I wanted to,” Cas says. “Now open it.”
“Mmhm. Yup.” Dean darts a glance at Sam, like he’s trying to mind-read whatever line he’d spun for Cas. Sam shrugs in response; it’d been safer to leave it at that and let Dean fill it in as he saw fit.
He heads for the kitchen, slowing slightly as he passes by Cas’ room, door firmly shut, thin slats of light escaping the vent near its base confirming the presence of its occupant.
Before he can say anything he surprises himself with a yawn. He takes a quick glance at his watch, blinking in surprise at how late it had gotten. “I’ll pester Crowley in the morning for those negating spells he mentioned, figure they’re worth a shot.”
“Now that you’ve seen how
Cas follows nervously after him.
Eventually, by unspoken agreement, they’d shoved it under the metaphorical rug and moved on.
The kids were already tucked into bed and Kevin had decided to call it a night early for once, leaving Sam alone with his research in the library. He’s in the middle of half-reading, half-translating an old Scandinavian spellbook he’d found in storage so he’s not paying attention when he gropes for his phone and answers the call. “Hello?”
“Wake me up when it’s Christmas at a more reasonable hour,” Dean mumbles, pulling up his blanket and turning to face away from her.
Still, Stone-Cold Fox dude could definitely do better than Grumpy Male Model dude and not just because their combined hotness just didn’t seem fair to the world; he deserved someone nicer if varying levels of ‘grumpy to downright unfriendly’ were the other guy’s only settings.
he thinks,
He leans back, fiddling with the beer bottle label as he darts a glance in Cas’ direction. He looks more awake now if still a little tired as he goes back to his reading. Sensing Dean’s gaze, Cas looks up and meets his eyes, brow raised in silent question.
“Yes,” Sam insists, bringing out the puppy dog eyes. “Please, Dean? It’s Christmas.”
“Cas.”
Cas looks at him flatly. “Yes.”
Silence seems like the safest bet until he can get his coffee and leave, but that idea gets nixed when his stomach lets out a loud growl, making it known that it doesn’t like to be ignored. Dean pauses in his dough rolling to glance up at him. “When’s the last time you ate?”
He turns when Kevin doesn’t hand him any more food, raising a brow at the look he’s getting. “I’m honestly surprised that you aren’t trying to make them eat healthier.”
Dean opens and closes his mouth, like a flustered parrot trying to figure out how to speak, but Sam raises his hands up to forestall him. “Didn’t mean to interrupt anything, so I’ll leave you guys to it.” He smirks then. “Congrats on finally getting your heads out of your asses.”
Sam turns to look at Kevin, sitting across from him at the table, head propped up on his fist and giving him an amused look. Sam closes his books, stretching his arms over his head. “I don’t know ‘bout you, Kev, but I could use a break.”
“Buzzy has to come to sleep too,” Cas says sleepily, punctuating his sentence with a yawn. He pushes the blanket off, rubbing at his eyes.
“Ah, yeah,” Sam says with a bit of surprise.
“You actual asshole.” Dean sniffs, trying to rein himself in, before pulling back just enough to glare at Cas. “Don’t even
He fiddles with one of the laminated menus nearby until she’s back, setting the carafe back in the coffee machine before turning to Dean. “You need something else, hon?”
Castiel nods, turning back to the register just in time to greet the newest customer.
Dean starts rifling through his papers immediately, eyes scanning through them quickly. Sam puts the box aside and does the same. It doesn’t take too long before they find it.
A handful of people in a little suburb area in Bennett, Colorado had been aging rapidly with no explanation as to how or why. There’d also been an increase in missing person reports around the same time, but no one had thought to connect the two, for obvious reasons.
Well, his bad. He rattles off the total and starts bagging up the guy’s purchases, figuring he can give one last shot to indulge his curiosity masked under polite sympathy. His expression turns commiserating as he says, “It sucks when the boyfriend puts you in the doghouse.”
Gabriel’s aid in this endeavor would likely have made the process easier. But no, this was something Cas wanted to be entirely of his own making. His only concession was to wheedle Gabriel’s pie recipe out of him to mitigate his chances of screw-ups or sub-par results.
“I-” Dean pauses. He’d been about to brush it off, play it as some kind of last favor thing for helping get his ass out of Purgatory, but the words don’t seem to want to come out of his mouth. He clears his throat roughly and tries again.
“Dean?” Cas says questioningly, looking between the leather-bound journal in his hands and Dean in confusion.
“What? No.” Sam straightens up with an amused little huff. “Things aren’t exactly that exciting back in the bunker,” Sam says with a wave of his hand and a stray
“Yeah,” Sam answers, tensing up briefly in expectation of the spell going into effect. When it doesn’t, he relaxes, relieved that that was apparently enough. He’s been going over their interactions the last day or two and he thinks he’s figured out the little bit of leeway it allows and decides to take advantage of it. “Guess I’m a little restless still.”
Castiel huffs a sigh and nods. “I was hoping to get some coffee. Later, I suppose.”
Sam squints against the sunlight, searching for Dean and Cas. It takes him a few minutes of scanning the area before he catches sight of them by the tree line. It’s a generous take on ‘staying in sight of the bunker’ if anyone asked Sam. Not that he could really blame them, it was nice to feel the sunlight again.
“Cas, I need you to talk to me. Tell me what’s wrong.”
“It’s been a month,” Sam reminds him, staring down at the closed book in front of him. “And nothing’s changed. I don’t know how much longer I can keep at this before royally screwing it up somehow.” He huffs a small, mirthless laugh. “Not that I haven’t already managed to.”
Sam hesitates even though the act clearly causes him some discomfort. Castiel waits, refraining from prompting the answer, his last attempt had seemed to make things worse. Sam would have to answer eventually.
“Nothing,” Dean says quickly. “You do what you gotta do, Sammy. Just don’t tell Cas about this.”
“Is that why you’ve been keeping me so busy lately?” Cas interrupts, voice low. “Because he asked you to?”
Sam tries to get at him from either side of Kevin for a few seconds before relenting.
Once the smoke dissipates Sam, Kevin and Charlie are able to see that – yes, Dean and Cas are finally back to normal. It takes a few seconds before everyone realizes that while Dean and Cas were adults again, they were currently very naked adults.
Sam nods, smiling slightly. “Good. That’s great, Cas.” He glances at the haphazard pile next to his table. “Fingers crossed I should have it done by tonight.”
“I, that’s not-” Dean stutters for second before deciding,
Kevin stops abruptly, halfway across the room, eyes trained at a point behind Sam. “Uh Sam, don’t freak out but I think some kids snuck into the bunker with you.”
Standing right in the middle of the cooking bubble is Dean, mixing something in a bowl, focused entirely on it enough that he doesn’t seem to have noticed Kevin. This is a new, mundane level of weird and another point to the fever dream theory.
“Since I’m the one who made the pie, I believe I’m entitled to it,” he replies, snatching the fork and quickly helping himself to another mouthful. He turns to look at Dean, grinning impishly.
“Okay. Are we having… friends over?” He asks cautiously, slowly scuttling over to the coffee machine like he’s trying to make sure Dean doesn’t notice. Of course, Dean apparently hadn’t bothered to make a fresh batch of coffee while he’s on whatever weird cooking spree he’s on, so Kevin has to start up a pot himself.
He’s watching everyone greet each other joyfully from a distance, not wanting to bring the mood down. ‘
Much as he’s relieved at it not being Cas, Crowley isn’t exactly a better option. He tightens the belt of his robe self-consciously as he half-turns to face him. “What’re you doing here?”
Sam crosses his arms in front of his chest, patient but skeptical even faced with Dean’s frustration. “Say a lie.”
“Crocodile-head. The dog-head is Anubis,” Sam corrects again.
He barely finishes mentally patting himself on the back for bouncing back from the grouchy rebuff when the guy suddenly slams the cash down on the counter. Rick flinches back, barely biting back a shocked yelp.
The stuff that Sam is chanting is this (I hope): dismiss the cursed change, return them to what they once were
Kevin takes a sip of his beer and frowns. “About the fever? We’re lucky he didn’t catch pneumonia with how long he was out there, but he just needs a couple more days to-”
“How long are you planning to hide out in here like this?”
Cas looks at Sam thoughtfully, like he’s trying to suss out any ulterior motives. “What about Dean?”
Sam sighs. “You don’t need to keep asking that every other day.”
Crowley slants a flat glance at him. “I’m saying a little company wouldn’t be remiss. Feel free to pick my brains for a solution while I eat.”
By the time Cas finally peels away the paper Dean’s had half a dozen internal debates with himself trying to decide whether he should tear the wrapping off himself or if he should snatch it right back before Cas can see what’s inside.
Sam shakes his head. “That was me fixing my mistakes. This isn’t.”
“There’s no solution to be found because there isn’t any
“Alright,” Cas says, closing his book.
“I’ll take a crack at the books, see if I can’t find something on our new situation. Think you can keep the kids occupied?” Kevin asks Sam, watching him clear up the plates. At Sam’s sudden panicked look, he sighs.
Even with his own ass in the crosshairs, Dean still jumps away from research like he’s allergic. He’s not sure he’s even surprised anymore.
“So, what happens if the heart was heavier?”
“Cas,” Sam interrupts, soft but firm. Cas stops, watching Sam nervously. “Do you think this is your fault?”
The Empty materializes Death’s scythe while leveling Cas with a look. “Tell your pet human to stand down or I stop playing nice.”
There’s a sharp look in Dean’s eyes when he responds. “You tell me how you’d feel if I pulled a stunt like that on you. Oh, guess what,” he says sarcastically, “I
He gets out of the Impala, opens the back door, and squats down to be at eye level with the kids. "We're gonna go in and get some supplies, so I'm gonna need you two to behave, okay? No asking for everything in sight."
violate some childcare laws.
Even though Dean’s given him blanket permission to ask whatever he wants, he’s still obviously hesitant at crossing a limit. “Like what?”
Dean makes a face at Sam. “After being buried down here with all this junk, I want some fresh air
It takes Dean a few moments before he can figure out what to say. “Listen, I’m sorry about Jimmy. He didn’t deserve to get pulled into all our shit.” He bends his head down, trying to catch Cas’ eye. Cas meets it hesitantly. “But you can’t ask me to be sorry about the fact that it means you’re still around, ‘cause I
Surprise flickers across Cas’ expression. He looks like he’s gearing up to poke further, but something in Dean’s expression seems to filter through enough to warn him off.
“Whatever you’re gonna do after this, I’ve got your back.”
you, okay?” Dean blurts out. Cas isn’t dumb, he might miss social cues a shit ton of times, but he has to understand what Dean means because he’s not sure he’s able to put it in more explicit terms. (He has to. Or Dean’s gonna end up choking on his own tongue trying to make it more clear. And he will, if that’s what he needs to do.)
“I think I have a reasonably higher threshold for such work than Dean does,” Cas replies easily, “so there’s no need to worry.”
“And?” Sam asks.
“Consider this something like parole, for good behavior and whatnot.” At the uncertain look on Sam’s face, he adds, “I
Shock and anger flicker past its face as it inexpertly tries to dodge and swing the scythe at Dean.
“Well, I’ve got lunch ready so I’m gonna go call them back in,” Sam says, heading for the main door. Kevin grunts again, no longer listening.
After a few long seconds of mutual staring, he reaches up to gently cup Dean’s cheek with one hand. Dean’s eyes flutter half-shut as he leans into the touch before flitting up to meet Cas’ eyes. The other hand comes up, holding Dean in place.
“What do you need?”
No, no, no.
“Can’t wait for our date,
“I’m not following.”
that shade of blue?
Sam shakes his head with a rueful smile, glancing down at the open tome in front of him and then at his laptop. “I’ve still got a lot to do for us to start making some headway in reorganizing this room. Just bring me back a turkey sandwich or a salad.”
Dean grumbles a bit more before pushing himself up out of bed. He washes up quickly, reluctantly putting his sweater back on before he leaves the room to ward off the chill of the bunker. He makes his way to the kitchen; grabbing two mugs and filling them up from the carafe before trudging down the hall to the library.
His sleep cycle was already long shot to hell for months now, but moving into an underground bunker screwed with his perception of night and day to a new level. Time was just an illusion now. Hell, maybe all of this is some particularly horrendous fever dream because none of the last year and a half feels any more real now than it did living through it.
“I can’t. I have a situation going on here that’s taken priority. That’s why I was trying to get a hold of you,” Sam says, leaning back in his seat. “We were trying to take out a witch about a month ago and she got the upper hand on us and turned Dean and Cas into kids.”
Dean’s clearly trying to avoid getting unearthed, and Sam’s got a pretty decent idea of what.
He pushes the file back to Sam.
“Thanks, man. I appreciate it,” Sam says. They both say their goodbyes and hang up.
“Dead end?” Kevin asks.
“You wanna take a picture, Crowley?” Dean asks, arms crossed.
He pokes his head into the shower room next, but it’s similarly empty. Frowning, he pulls out his phone as he wanders down to the library, pulling up his contacts in search of Dean’s number when the smell of something mouthwateringly delicious reaches him.
He doesn’t get much time to wonder about it before Cas and Dean trudge up to the bunker door, covered from head to toe in mud. Sam stares at them for a moment, then sighs and walks back into the bunker not bothering to check and see if the kids were following.
They pull up some grass and flowers to put on their mud pies. Cas tries to make the grass stand up on his mud pie, which looks kinda silly, but Dean’s more interested in making his mud pie the best and puts lots more flowers on it than Cas has on his mud pie. Once they’re done he’s sure
Dean shakes his head harshly even as tears blur his vision.
Being in a relationship was the closest thing in their lives that could resemble ‘normal’ and it’s never worked out for Dean whenever he’d tried. Trying to give up the hunting life didn’t really change anything, so it stands to reason that Dean himself was the deciding factor. If he did try again with Cas against his better judgment, it’s bound to fail. And that’s assuming Cas wants it too.
Dean’s torn between laughing at the screw-up and groaning at Cas missing the point, as usual. A groan of resigned amusement wins out which he muffles with the hand he rubs over his mouth. “It’s ‘hold down the fort’. And you’re included, dumbass. Kevin too, if we can pry him out of his room.”
“Gotta say, I’m kinda surprised you still kept all that junk I gave you as a kid,” Dean says eventually, speaking more to the box in Cas’ hands than the guy himself. He realizes a little too late that it wasn’t quite the right thing to say.
He feels a tug on his pant leg. When he looks down, he finds Cas giving him his trademark squint, an expression that weirdly doesn’t manage to look out of place on a much younger face, before walking to the kitchen door and pointing down the hall. “Do you mean those?”
“We were just talking.”
. They’re going to need shoes.
Dean quickly scans through the page and snorts even as his eyebrows pull into a frown. “You can’t even call this a paragraph. All it says here is that it’s an ‘ancestral feather from Egypt’ and that the last owners said whoever holds it could ‘divine truth from anyone’. The ‘further examination required’ footnote is a great help,” he says sarcastically, flipping to the next page roughly. A scrawl of dark ink on the back of the page catches his eye.
He doesn't think he can outright ask Dean on a date but another solution comes to mind. Before he can chicken out, he quickly scrawls a message on the side of the to-go cup. Gabriel surreptitiously gives him an encouraging wink and thumbs up before heading back into the kitchen.
(See the end of the chapter for
He clears his throat, glancing at Cas. “Not feeling hungry, Cas?”
Cas stares at him for a long moment, lips pursed, before looking back down at his mug with a quiet, thoughtful hum.
He needs to be a special kind of drunk to be that loose-lipped, but here he is, middle of the freakin’ day, stone-cold sober, and telling his best friend he’s cute while they have lunch. In a setting that could be construed by some as a lunch date.
He plucks at the sleeves of the long-sleeved henley he’s wearing, staring at the hems as it stretches with the light tugs. “I couldn’t risk Naomi taking control again and trying to hurt you or Sam if I stayed. She’d already made me kill you hundreds of times before-”
“Bring me the items, of course.”
Mirth still humming in his mind, he hesitates for all of a few seconds before he picks up his phone and opens up a search page, typing in a few keywords. It doesn’t take much scrolling to find exactly what he’s looking for. Choking back another chuckle at the similarity, he saves it to his phone before opening his chat with Dean.
Setting down his cereal box, Sam turns to Dean with a frown. “Dean, it’s barely past seven-thirty in the morning. Hangovers aren’t new to you, or an actual problem.”
“Outside playing,” he replies, not looking at Sam.
to answer things I don’t want to.”
Sam’s eyebrows wing up at the admission, arms falling slack in surprise.
“Sorry I took so long to get back to ya. I was asking around for a solution to your problem, but all of my contacts were a bust. You guys have any progress breakin’ that spell?” Garth says, his voice crackling over the phone’s speaker.
“You boys don’t really know how to do normal, do you? Alright, I’m in. I’ll be there by tomorrow.”
Dean resisted the urge to roll his eyes. Smartass witches. “What, so going through menopause made you think you had the right to pick on other folks?”
“What is it?” Kevin asks, eyes on the phone in his hands.
about it. But nah,” Sam says sarcastically, “you’re fine. This is all fine.”
this, to live out the rest of his days as a human, is too fantastically ridiculous to wrap his head around.
Sam frowns, glancing down at the file and then back up at Dean. “You feel anything like that?”
Cas’ smile turns slightly apologetic but he doesn’t make any move to agree to Dean’s threat. Dean scowls at him before dropping his head back onto his shoulder, muttering, “And who told you I’m something you can’t have?”
"So," Dean says, watching the kitchen door swing closed, before turning to Castiel. He raises a brow. "Is he high or something today?"
“Why?”
“Hey there, kiddos. I’m the Queen.” She throws up a Vulcan sign with a grin. “
He ignores the two sets of eyes watching him expectantly. He doesn’t like this plan, but he’d sound like an idiot saying it out loud. Cas was a big-boy-not-quite-angel, he could take care of himself. They’d be able to cover more ground quicker this way, anyways.
Sam climbs down the stairs slowly, arms weighed down with groceries and a few bags of takeout. As he reaches the landing, he catches sight of Kevin sitting alone at one of the library tables, surrounded by a small stack of books. The kids are nowhere in sight. Not that it worries Sam, exactly. He’s just slightly suspicious when someone hasn’t got an eye on them after he’d found Dean trying to sneak into one of the storerooms the other day.
“I’m not,” Dean agrees, shrugging. “Don’t really play by those rules.”
This cannot be happening.
“Stop brooding and start unpacking.” Kevin nudges him, reaching for another bag. He pulls out a few frozen food boxes before turning to look at Sam. “I take it you’re not a fan of takeout.”
Cas frowns, staring intently at Dean like he can read his mind. “You’re obfuscating.”
Eventually, Dean notices how Cas’ gaze keeps darting towards a couple of guys playing a boisterous round of pool. Sam notices the same thing not long after. Maybe he’s not used to the trash-talking or he’s not familiar with the game; whichever it is, Dean somehow finds himself standing across a pool table from Cas and teaching him how to play.
“If it’s quid pro quo you’re after, I make a mean coffee.”
“I’ve been trying out a few new tricks I learned on some of the more annoying ones,” she admits. “They’re still around, not quite human though. Can’t guarantee they’re alive either.” She smiles then, sharp and mean. “Life is short and fickle like that.”
Unlike Dean, Sam didn’t have any lingering hangups with Cas or find any need to hide how happy he was that Cas was there with them. They’d taken to watching documentaries together in Sam’s room during his enforced bed rest, Sam peppering Cas with questions whenever he pointed out an inaccuracy or went off on some tangent. Once Dean could trust him to be mobile on his own and not fall under his own weight, that shifted into nerdy discussions in the library that went completely over Dean’s head.
Cas stares at him, lips parted and eyes wide. He isn’t saying anything, just sitting there and gaping at him. Shit, maybe he
and Castiel, unwilling to pick a side in that particular argument, found himself stuck in the middle. Now that he was human, from sacrificing his own grace to burn the mark away, it made for some awkward living arrangements.
“What,” she replies flatly.
The rain doesn’t let up even when he reaches the bunker, and he ends up soaked through even more than before trying to run the short distance to the bunker’s entrance.
Dean appreciates the quiet, but there’s a question on his lips itching to be asked. It’s not important, not right now, but a masochistic part of him wants to know.
“Shall we start now?” Cas asks, looking excited.
Dean goes cross-eyed for a moment staring at her finger as she pulled her hand back before the words sink in.
“You sure that's a good idea?” Sam asks dryly. “Or that Kevin’ll even agree to it? I don’t know if I’ve even seen him step out of his room at all since we brought Crowley back.”
Cas shrugs, still not looking at Sam.
“The scarf is definitely an improvement to your look,” Dean says, watching as Cas’ smile turned amused.
Dean watches it wriggle around in his hand. “Are you gonna eat it?”
Considering the newly assigned ‘Stone-Cold Fox’ status of the guy, Rick has to reassess his initial assumption from the previous day. No way Grumpy Male Model dude is dating someone like this guy and
“You need to make sure it doesn't become worse,” Cas says in what he considers a serious ‘doctor’ voice. Sam nods solemnly, trying to hide his smile.
Dean snorts and doesn’t say anything else.
Dean grunts. “Needed to think.” At Sam’s raised eyebrows, Dean changes tracks, asking instead, “How’re you holdin’ up?”
Sam glances at Dean expectantly. Dean’s scowl deepens as his gaze flits between him and Crowley.
“What’s what?” Sam asks back, not looking away from the kids.
“I’ll get Cas to help pull any Men of Letters records he can find and…” Catching Dean’s expression, he trails off. “What?”
). Dean brightens right back up while Sam breathes a quiet sigh of relief.
“Damn it, Dean!” Sam shouts, hand smacking the table loudly as he turns to glare at his kid brother. Dean flinches back at the noise. “You think we’ll get
“Is this some dumb new prank you’re trying to pull, Dean? You’re one of the best liars I know.”
Sam’s grimace at that seems to confirm it. “Yes and no,” he says slowly, looking hesitant to say more. He clears his throat uncomfortably.
Part of Dean wants to object at that, say something about him not being alone as long as he and Sam are around, but he can't seem to find his voice to do it. He realizes after a moment that it's about more than being human or permanently stuck in a human body without getting a choice in the matter; he's cut off from heaven and his family in a way he's never been before, one that's more final than anything in the past. There's nothing Dean can say in light of that.
“What d’you wanna do?” Dean asks, turning to Cas.
“Or,” Dean cuts in, a little too loud in its nonchalance, “you could, y’know, stay here.”
“We stopped at a diner a couple of hours ago,” Sam replies, a little defensively. “But, I guess we could eat again.”
“What?”
“Just making sure I’m doing my little brother duties right,” Sam responds cheerily.
“Another question, if I may?”
“No, not home,” Sam agrees. “But we’ll go home soon, promise.”
nerd thing. What about them?”
get caught. Capiche?”
He opens his mouth, figuring he’d redirect the conversation to safer topics, then frowns, taking Cas in.
Stone-Cold Fox tilts his head. “Ridiculous?”
When Sam reaches the unlit kitchen, he sighs. Apparently he’d managed to wake up before Dean today. Switching the lights on, he starts the coffee machine up, setting his mug down next to it.
“You need to take a few minutes to calm down, let him have some space.
He runs a hand through his hair, pushing back a few loose strands that were falling onto his face. “If you’re willing to stick around for a little longer, we can search these files, maybe we’ll find something.”
“You guys keep at it, I’m gonna go give Crowley his dinner.”
Things carry on this way for a few hours and it’s not until the kids are yawning and rubbing at their eyes that Kevin realizes that it’s long past time that they should have been put to bed. He nudges Sam with his foot, nodding at the kids when he looks up questioningly.
Freakin’ warn a man, Sammy,” Dean complains, leaning back and wincing at the throbbing in his foot. He flexes it to check if anything was damaged, wincing at the resulting twinge of pain. Nothing felt broken.

You weren't really a hunter till you took down a witch anyway. And hey, him and Sam would be there to help Cas learn the ropes.
“Hello, De-”
If this was one of the sappy stories Sam loved to read, Sam would be telling him that Cas’ actions and intentions mirror Dean’s. That he’d be an idiot not to take a chance on this. But this isn’t a story, and he’s terrified to work on hypotheticals. Because what if he’s wrong, and he ruins things and loses his best friend? That instead Cas is actually afraid of Dean blowing up at him for accidentally uncorking the emotional constipation he had bottled away for years in front of the last person he’d want seeing or hearing it.
Cas stares at him in wide-eyed surprise.
Cas shrugs.
In a bid to not seem like a creep staring at a customer, Rick goes back to reorganizing the shelves while waiting for the guy to come and ring up his purchases.
It isn’t true, exactly. He
“Not to sound like I’m questioning your graciousness,” Crowley starts, with an underlying current of sarcasm that makes it sound like precisely that, “since I
Dean digs in immediately, humming in pleasure as he chews. “This is good, Cas."
When Cas doesn’t say anything for a long minute, he hesitantly squints his eyes open to see his reaction. Whatever he was expecting, the confused, vaguely uncomprehending expression isn’t it.
Cas absolutely adores the guinea pigs, holding one carefully in his lap and petting it with a beatific smile on his face, like there’s nowhere else he’d rather be. Dean’s favorite turns out to be the baby goats – a little black and white one, in particular, takes quite a shine to Dean, jumping around him and gently butting him in the side. They chase each other around the pen for some time, Sam taking pictures all the while.
Cas carefully sets down the books he’s carrying as he replies, “Not according to Dean, no.”
Well, time to bite the bullet.
say no.
Kevin rubs a hand tiredly down his face as he wanders down the hall with only one thing on his mind: coffee.
“Good morning to you too,” Crowley replies easily, unphased. He’s similarly dressed-down in some old Men of Letters’ clothes Sam had scrounged up for him, sans the dead-guy robe, looking just as comfortable in it as he did in a three-piece suit. “A lack of caffeine in your system really does make a difference to your manners, doesn’t it?”
He floors it to the nearest Walmart, trying to give Kevin a call on the way so that he can give him a heads up on the situation. It goes straight to voicemail.
“No,” Sam interrupts, still in a staring match with his beer, “not that. This whole situation.”
“Cas, hey,” Sam says softly.
the one who asked for it in the first place.”
Kevin gives Sam a gimlet eye. “Not with the amount of salt you tried to choke me with yesterday.”
Much fuller, but still off-balance from the weird, somewhat frustrating interaction in the kitchen, a distracted Kevin ends up walking face-first into the surprisingly firm chest of the resident angel. Sorry, ex-angel.
“I get it. But I survived, so we’ll deal and readjust like we always do. And you’re here too, it helps.”
Sam watches them trail after Kevin like a pair of child-sized lost puppies, shaking his head with a smile. He heads for the stairs, digging the car keys out of his pocket. He still needed to bring all the kids’ new stuff out of the car.
Dean's in the middle of searching the living room for hex bags or spellbooks, so far finding a fat load of nada, when he notices the sound of music coming from the other end of the house. Giving the room a quick once-over, he adjusts his grip on his gun and follows the soft strains of music towards their source, which turns out to be the kitchen. The witch in question is there, humming along to the radio while washing dishes.
He hadn’t realized he could still feel alone even while near people he cared about.
Sam reads between the lines easily enough. Nightmares aren’t new to him, but they would be to Cas. He hadn’t thought too much on it when he found Cas already busy at work in the storeroom before he got there; now though, Sam sees it as the attempt for a distraction that it is. Not that it seems to be helping.
There wasn’t enough
He can’t afford to be sidetracked, being as short for time as he is, so he decides to do a thorough cleanup once everything is done. He hurries on, quickly rolling out a new crust and setting it in the tin.
When he doesn’t respond, Kevin decides that maybe it’s time for an ultimatum.
“You gonna tell me why?”
Inevitably, his thoughts manage to make their way back to Cas. Cas sitting beside Sam listening to him speaking animatedly; curled over his mug of coffee sleepily at the kitchen table; a sleep-rumpled Cas in his pajamas brushing past Dean in the hallway. There's so many little moments they have now that they'd never gotten a chance to have before.
“The goddess Ammit would eat it and they’d be condemned to eternity in the underworld.”
“There’s got to be some way out of this,” Dean blurts out, even as Cas shakes his head. Dean wants to reach out and grab him by the lapels of his trenchcoat and shake him till he takes it back, but the pain and panic have him rooted to the spot. “I’m not going to lie down and just let it-”
Cas grimaces. “That doesn’t sound like it would taste good.”
Crowley gives a small shake of his head, chewing slowly.
be the end of the matter, his brain’s stuck on it. Telling it not to think about it only makes it think about it more.
Dean snorts to himself. At least this wasn’t one game he had to worry about losing.
Dean flinches like he’d shouted instead, going stiff before seeming to force himself to relax. A small part of Castiel’s mind recognizes the action as an echo he hadn’t quite noticed happening over and over the last few days. He feels an ache he can’t quite understand at the realization.
include being able to see the specific spells or curses an object might hold written in a script that only my eyes can behold.”
If God was out there somewhere in the universe, He was probably laughing His ass off at Dean right about now.
“Your bed’s bound to be a better napping place than the library,” Dean jokes, taking a long sip of his beer as he pulls one of the books from the nearby stack and opening it. It’s a book on rare herbs and their magical and non-magical uses. Dean bites back a sigh; they really needed to get some decent fiction books in here.
There’s a muscle ticking in Cas’ jaw, glare fixed on the floor hard enough to burn a hole through the cement if he’d still been juiced up on angel mojo. It’s much more of a reaction than Dean was expecting for his throwaway comment.
“Hey,” Dean says, moving to face him. “You okay? What was that?”
“How much, Cas?”
“I’m game.” Kevin closes his book with a smirk. “You better be ready for me to wipe the floor with you, Winchester.”
“Hey Cas, have you seen Dean?” he asks.
“No,” Dean says, still not meeting his eyes. “Figured it was inevitable that I’d end up saying something that would ruin what we’ve got going now or chase you off. Maybe both.”
He gets a refill of coffee before he leaves, setting aside a covered plate of the remaining pancakes alongside a bottle of the strawberry syrup Cas likes on the island for him to find for whenever he decides to wander in. He wasn’t feeling guilty. Nope. He'd just made extra like a decent person would do.
Dean grunts and tries to smirk. “Have you
“Dean, I honestly wouldn’t care if it was wrapped in tinfoil,” Cas says gently. He takes the same amount of care with undoing it as he did with the cheery Christmas themed paper that had covered Sam’s present.
Dean shuts his mouth with an audible
He picks up the ring box to take a closer look at it. “This, however, is just a trinket, albeit a genuinely old one. Decent craftsmanship. Haven’t seen one like it in a good while.”
“Nothing,” Dean mutters before stalking back to their table.
Confused, he opens up the chat with Sam, only to find a gif of a fuzzy grey-black cat staring down away from the camera. He downloads it out of habit more than any actual interest in seeing the gif. Once it’s done downloading, a blur of what Dean assumes is someone’s legs cross the camera, prompting the cat to look up at the camera with a frown that slowly slides into a squint.
“Guess you guys finally talked things out,” Sam says awkwardly, making Dean stiffen up. He can’t seem to decide whether to shove Cas back like it’d erase the last few minutes from Sam’s memory or just keep holding on to him since they’re already busted, and ends up doing a hilariously twitchy mix of both. Cas, for his part, slowly turns to look at Sam evenly, though the nice little rosy hue on his cheeks doesn’t help with his attempt to look unaffected. The slightly husky quality to his voice (and god, Sam is actively trying to not think about why his voice is at a lowered timbre) doesn’t help either as he says, “Something like that.”
Dean can distantly hear Sam spluttering a laugh into his beer and hopes he manages to choke on it.
you asking for my help?” he asks curiously.
To clarify, this takes place in a slightly different season 8, one where Cas got out of Purgatory with Dean (instead of being yanked out by the angels) but ended up pretty drained of grace after being there for so long / struggling to get out. As such things progressed quite a bit differently.
Cas tilts his head thoughtfully, squinting up at a swallow that trills loudly as it flies over his head and into a nearby tree.
“It’s good,” Cas says sincerely, mouth half-full. “You’re a very good cook, Dean.”
doesn’t want to be somehow caught in the middle when it does.
“Don’t forget the butter,” Kevin reminds him as he starts up the stove. Sam brings the ingredients over, mostly intending to hover and watch him cook until Kevin has him set up a pan of his own to toast the bread for lack of an actual toaster to speed things up.
Dean shrugs, mouth half-full even as he replies. “Remind me to show you the bunker’s gun range when we get back so you can get some practice in.”
Nodding, Kevin heads towards the kids, ruffling their heads as he walks past them. “C’mon, let’s go get you some grub.”
Sam stares at the table in surprise for a moment, before peeking down to find Cas holding Buzzy close to himself protectively and glaring at him.
Sam loses an hour to the effort by the end of which it’s become more of him refreshing his memory on ancient Egyptian mythology than anything else. Figuring he’s wasted enough time, he starts closing all the open tabs he has, pausing on one with an image of Ma’at standing beside other gods of the Egyptian pantheon.
“Well, would you look at the time? I have some stuff I need to take care of before bed. Don’t forget to wash up.”
On occasion Dean happens to come by with a book in hand, though he usually ends up spending more time chatting with Castiel than he does reading his book, something which secretly pleases him.
“My name’s Donnie Scofield, I’m a mechanic from Wichita and…” he trails off. Sam’s giving him Judgmental Bitch Face #4, the
“…I’m not,” Sam says, turning to look at Kevin in confusion. He blinks in surprise. “Um, Kevin?”
“You’re the best, Sammy.” Dean grins, slapping Sam roughly on the shoulder.
“It ain’t even the first time it’s happened,”
“It may be ‘junk’,” Cas says stiffly, hands tightening around the box, “but it's still mine.”
a line of questioning he wants to be thinking about right now.
It’s a gentle statement, not a demand, but it’s still enough for Dean to feel the touch of the spell at his throat as he swallows.
He’s both excited and nervous when the timer dings. If it’s ruined again he has no time to make another one. He holds his breath as he carefully takes out the pie tin, letting out a sigh of relief once he’s placed it on the cooling rack. The lattice crusting of the pie was a little uneven and it looks slightly overcooked; as far as appearances were concerned, it was acceptable. The real mark of success would be the taste.
He couldn’t exactly bury her in her own backyard or, for that matter, leave the kids behind to go and bury her in some abandoned plot. He chews his lip, thinking. He
She tsks. “I wouldn't do that if I were you. Who’s to say I can’t cast a spell on you faster than you can draw your gun and shoot me?” she asks, an amused glint in her eyes.
Figuring that’s all there was to really talk about, he goes back to scarfing down dinner.
“It’s Sam,” he says, a little exasperated. Still no response. He huffs quietly to himself and tries the handle, blinking in surprise when it opens into a dark and obviously empty room.
“Yes, you are,” Gabriel agrees, flirty smirk firmly in place.
“The bunker has a ton of items for casting spells,” Sam points out. “The Men of Letters kept a pretty stocked inventory. If we’re lucky, we’ll have all the things we need for this spell.”
Dean fudges over whether or not to leave him be, then decides he’ll park himself a little further away. He winces as the chair screeches against the floor as he pulls it out even though he’d been trying to be quiet.
And what better way to do that than going out for drinks later tonight?
the time or place, besides which, he's not the kind of asshole to make Cas think he'd need to have sex with Dean for shit he's happy to give him for free.
Sam’s managed to make his way to them by that point. He winces at Dean’s words, feeling like an absolute tool. He kneels, trying to meet his brother’s eyes. “Dean, no, I didn't mean it like that. It’s just-” Sam sighs. “I was having a bad day and I was tired, but that’s not your fault. I shouldn’t have snapped at you, I’m sorry.”
“Lez’ play a game,” Dean tries again, turning on his puppy dog pout. It’s dangerously effective because Sam finds himself caving right away.
“You’re welcome,” She says cheerfully. She picks up the next present, turning it this way and that. “Okay, not sure who this one’s for, can’t see a name-”
“Don’t. Don’t
Dean’s already sitting at the dining table, pizzas laid out in the center and a few slices in front of him when Sam and Cas enter the kitchen. He’d been distractedly fiddling with his phone, but Sam catches the aborted glance in their direction that he covers for by immediately shoving a slice of pizza into his mouth. He rolls his eyes as he takes a seat across from Dean, watching as his brother tries not to show his obvious relief when Cas takes the empty seat at what passes for the head of the table instead of the one beside him.
Dean and Cas are fast asleep, curled towards one another with Buzzy in the middle, both of them holding on to it loosely in their sleep. Sam manages to bite back the noise he almost made at the adorable sight and quietly takes a few pictures of them on his phone before slipping out of the room.
“Sue me for wanting to get some fresh air.”
“Thanks, Sam,” Cas says, hugging Buzzy to his chest.
Dean leans forward suddenly, grabbing Cas’ face and angling it into a kiss, close-mouthed and soft. Cas closes his eyes, savoring it. Dean sucks at the edge of his lower lip before pulling back, eyes half-lidded.
Cas gives him a look like he wants to object but accedes, moving to push the nearest shelving unit in front of the door. It won’t do much to delay the inevitable, but Dean’s nothing if not stubborn.
He paces in the small confines of the bathroom, running a hand through his hair agitatedly and scowling at his own reflection as he catches a glimpse of it. This was grade-school levels of embarrassing and not the kind of situation Dean Winchester was ever supposed to be caught up in.
“How are you feeling?”
Sam turns and heads off to his own room to get ready for bed.
Rick’s busy killing time reorganizing the shelves behind the counter during a lull in his afternoon shift when the bell over the door jingles.
Dean rolls his eyes at her and goes back to drinking his coffee, ignoring the amused look that Cas directs his way.
our win while we actually have the time, for once.”
Dean stews in his irritation for the rest of the afternoon.
“You wanna talk about it?” Sam offers.
me to?" She snorts, sending his gun flying with a flick of her hand. "Yeah, not happening."
Sam takes a sip of his coffee, side-eyeing Dean. “I’ll let you know how much I enjoy it once you’re done playing hide and seek with Cas.”
“Oh,” Sam says. “Right.”
Cas smiles back. “Yes.”
“Happy birthday, Dean.”
Rubbing some grease off with a stray rag, he eyes the Impala. He decides to take her out for another spin,
Dean concedes with a sigh and a roll of his eyes, raising his arms up in a stretch. “Fine. God, I can’t wait for this to be over.”
“You bet. I’m the reigning queen of Moondor. And you-” she says, leaning forward to tap him on the nose, “were my handmaiden.”
“You’ve never really seen the place before, right? I mean, I assume you haven’t.”
At that, Dean frowns. He turns to look up at Cas, only for him to get a small shrug in return. “Not home?” he asks Sam.
Rick sighs quietly to himself. Maybe they
He frowns when he doesn’t get a reply, squinting in their direction. Either they were arguing with each other much less loudly than Sam would expect on whether or not it was worth coming in for lunch, or they were planning on actually listening to him for once.
?” Dean asks, feeling self-conscious.
Sam blinks at that, confused for a few seconds before it suddenly clicks.
’ Rick thinks despairingly, ‘
Cas doesn’t answer for a long moment before he quietly says, “I know we’re not supposed to be like this.”
Humiliation churns in his gut. It’s bad enough that he compared Cas to a cat, he could play that off somehow, but how the hell does he play off calling Cas
Annoyed with himself, he starts fiddling with the radio.
Kevin pulls the book back, flipping through a few pages before turning it back to Sam. “Think this might be it?”
Charlie and Kevin are busy talking animatedly about who knows what, but he catches Sam’s watching them with a smile. It makes Dean feel like he’s being spied on even though he’s not doing anything illegal.
Their latest case was
“Your face. But the bag full of frozen food was a close second.” He nods at the bag Sam’s unloading. “I’m guessing that’s got more.”
, oozing its contents onto the kitchen floor.
There’s a lethargic feeling to the afternoon as they finish off lunch. So much so that Sam and Cas don’t even put up a token argument when Dean insists on taking a break before getting back to work. Not that he really expected them to, Sam’s still recovering his stamina no matter what lines he tries to feed Dean, and the clean-up was eating into the naps Cas liked taking. He’d probably be useless afterwards, but hey, that was going to be Sam’s problem, not Dean’s.
Dean had had days to seethe in his anger back then, likely building up since before whatever went down in the crypt. Sam still doesn’t know the details. He can’t imagine that they’d actually talked it out while Sam had been practically comatose during the earlier stages of his recovery; knowing his brother, he’d likely cheaply wallpapered over it and hoped it stuck.
By the time they finally pull apart it’s because they’re smiling too much to keep going. Dean wonders what expression must be on Sam’s face now that the smug look was wiped away, and he’s tempted to look since it’s not often that he gets one over on Sam but the warm smile on Cas’ face is a much better view.
“Cas,” Dean says softly.
Dean gives Sam a challenging look, chin raised like he’s expecting to not be believed.
“Then tell me.”
“But it didn’t,” Sam counters, shutting the fridge door and leaning against it. “And sure, recovery sucks, but it’s actually
“Nah, Valentine’s Day is overrated,” Dean replies, warily amused at Gabriel’s sudden and unexpected interest in him.
Cas carefully puts the books aside before getting up to envelop Sam in a hug. “Thank you, Sam.”
Damn it, shit just got more complicated.
“‘kay,” Dean mumbles. He moves closer, reaching up to hug Sam, fingers gripping tight onto Sam’s shirt as he buries his face in his neck. “Wuv you, Sammy.”
There’s probably more they need to talk about, but right now, it really,
“Damn it,” he curses under his breath, scrambling to get out of his chair. “Dean!”
Sam’s lips purse. “You just seem kinda off today.”
While Dean had been busy tackling his inner turmoil, Cas never even bothered to move, still sitting with his head down and shoulders slumped as if he didn’t even have the strength to brace himself for the blow of Dean’s words.
He hands it over, watching Crowley narrowly as he digs in.
Cas doesn’t say anything as he starts gathering up the dishes. Taken off-guard, it takes Sam a few seconds before he joins in, following Cas to the kitchen.
Dean grunts. “Just enjoy the food.”
He pockets his phone and follows the smell to the kitchen, pausing at the entryway. Dean doesn’t notice him, busy wrestling with a tin of flour.
“Mind if I ask you something?”
It doesn’t take Sam’s long to get a pyre set up to salt-and-burn the body, the lack of snow Lebanon’s been having working to his advantage. Not that it isn’t cold, of course. Sam shivers as he moves closer to the fire, wishing that she’d either burn faster or hotter before he lost any sense of feeling in his hands.
“Alright. We’ll need to spread out a bit to try and cover more rooms. I’ll take the upper level; both of you can check the storerooms and the other rooms on this level.”
“So, uh,” Sam says, effectively ruining the nice mushy moment Dean was having – what? He has them sometimes – by reminding them of his presence. “you handled that surprisingly well.”
He turns back to Cas with a half-smile. “Thanks. Now if you could just do something about Dean’s mother-henning, things'll be perfect.”
Sam snorts. Hiding his amused smile, he eyes his brother.
this time, and clear his head a bit.
Cas bumps into Sam as he’s leaving the last storeroom. He gives Sam a hopeful look, expression falling when Sam shakes his head.
A little more reinvigorated by their afternoon walk, Sam settles down at his makeshift workstation figuring he’ll take one final crack shot at researching a solution for their feathery problem.
“Yeah,” Dean says softly, before clearing his throat and speaking more normally. “Yeah, I’m more than amenable to it. And listen, no matter what happens, you’ll always be my best friend, Cas.”
“Yeah, you did,” Sam agrees. “Dean always thought you were kinda badass, even if he never told you.”
“Most of the solutions I found online agreed with your suggestion to stay hydrated. The pain medication also helps.” At Sam’s curiously amused look, he adds assuringly, “It was mild.”
Of course, Cas doesn't seem to notice Dean’s momentary speechlessness – the guy either has vision impairment to not notice how red his cheeks must be or is actually smart enough to
Cas is watching him right back, expression almost nervous as Dean stops in front of him. He doesn’t move when Dean reaches out and hesitantly grabs his shoulder.
” Cas says, tightening his grip on the box, pulling it closer to himself. As if he’s trying to protect it from Dean.
"Well, you should’ve taken a slice for yourself then. Here, you can try some of mine,” Dean says, offering up a forkful of pie.
Focus broken, Sam blinks in surprise, glancing over his shoulder at Cas. “You don’t look so great either. How’s the hangover treating you?”
Sam reaches over, placing the back of his hand at Dean’s forehead, frowning at the heat radiating from him. He looks down at Dean, who stares up at him in glassy-eyed misery. Sam didn’t need to be a genius to realize he was running a fever.
“Are we-” he breaks off, frowning down at his ice cream cup. He hastily eats a spoonful before trying again. “Were we friends… before?” Cas asks, not looking up from his slowly melting scoop of chocolate chip.
“Tha’s ‘cuz you a Sam-oh-saw-us,” Dean replies, giggling. Sam decides to retract his earlier thought. His brother was clearly an adorable smartass.
Dean sets the gun aside, getting back to his burger. “Need to make sure you ain’t accidentally gonna shoot yourself in the foot.” He can see Sam rolling his eyes at him in his periphery but chooses to ignore it.
“Dean can’t have any ice cream until after his throat infection is gone,” Sam reminds him. Cas doesn't stop frowning, though he’s at least toned down the glare a few notches. “I promise we’ll take him out for ice cream once he’s better, okay?”
Cas takes it from him, giving him a big gummy smile. It makes Dean feel all warm and squirmy inside. It’s kinda weird but he decides he likes the feeling. “Thank you, Dean.”
"I don't know why I'm even surprised anymore." Dean shakes his head ruefully. “I swear, one day I’m gonna do something about the black hole of pop culture knowledge you have in that head of yours.”
Dean doesn’t look up, chopping more aggressively.
“Sam?”
Sam bobs his head agreeably. “It’s worth a shot.”
“I was starting to think you were gonna hide in your room all night,” Sam says, smirking.
“…Are we celebrating something?” Kevin asks, a mixture of confusion and suspicion as he grips his thermos tighter. He’s pretty sure he’s only been holed up in his room for a day or two, three tops while recovering from his hangover. Sure he hasn’t been keeping track of the days before that, but it should still only be May, probably.
Cas nods understandingly. Sam darts little side-glances at Cas as they keep walking, their earlier conversation still bouncing around in his head.
Jack gasps and straightens up suddenly.
Sam chuckles quietly to himself as he walks off. He’d better go and warn Kevin against going to the kitchen for the next few hours, just in case they don’t actually make it out of there.
Crowley shrugs. “I told you they wouldn’t work. Patience should serve you better, I’d think.”
Cas’ brows furrow. “What do you mean?”
Of course, that didn't mean that he didn't enjoy cases where they had to track down a witch or a coven. Being magically choked or thrown into walls aside, it gave him a chance to rid the world of a few of those damn magical menaces to society.
Before Dean can try to parse what he’s getting at or think to ask, Cas shakes his head. “What do you want, Dean?”
They barely stop to dump their stuff at the nearest motel once they’re in Bennett before splitting up to do a little sleuthing. Cas tags along with Sam to question the victims, while Dean goes to meet the sheriff.
With research work still calling him and the specter of Dean’s anxious pestering looming, he needs to get back to it soon. Opening the fridge in search of some water, Sam goes still, staring at the tupperware containers taking up most of the fridge space; all this restless ‘avoidance cooking’ was getting a little out of hand.
Cas frowns. “I know better than to eat food gone bad.”
“You’re welcome,” Crowley replies.
Dean smirks, eyebrows raised in a
“Alright. But no running off, okay?” Sam tells him. Dean nods enthusiastically, holding onto Sam’s arms as he’s hoisted out of the cart. He wanders off immediately, flitting from shelf to rack, but manages to stay within sight. After a few minutes, he comes bounding back to Sam excitedly, narrowly avoiding tripping and falling flat on his face in his excitement.
“Or?” Dean prompts gruffly.
‘Cas’ turns to look back at him. “Yes-” he starts to say when the guy decides to interrupt him.
Cas wanders into the kitchen silently sometime in the mid-morning, quiet enough that Dean doesn’t notice him until he pipes up with a, “Hello, Dean.”
ask. He already knows neither of them knows where they are, and that tells him plenty.
Cas looks down at the book in front of him, idly running his thumb over the edge of the pages. “Return to heaven I suppose. While there’s not much I can do, if Jack intends to use the remnants of Adam’s power to fix things up there, the least I can do is give him what support I can.”
Bublé’s back and singing about a
“In the interest of not getting poisoned again, I’ll help make breakfast today. As long as it’s not eggs.”
Dean works his jaw, glaring down at the countertop.
“If he doesn’t show up, the worst that’s likely to happen is that he’ll wander in here a couple of hours later scrounging for cold leftovers.”
“PB&J san’wiches are awesome, Cas!” Dean exclaims, grinning toothily. Kevin turns, two plates of sandwiches in hand, and notices Sam hovering awkwardly in the doorway. He raises a brow. “Where’d you wander off to?”
(See the end of the chapter for
“Eggs are good for-”
“Please ignore him, Dean. He likes to act like the brother I never wanted,” Castiel says, with a glare directed towards Gabriel.
Cas shakes his head first, then nods a second later.
“Uh-” Kevin says smartly. “No?”
“‘Kay,” Dean agrees easily.
Crowley hums thoughtfully. There’s not much to gain from actually helping the Winchesters, but it
Sam hands the box over.
The younger Winchester hesitates, clearly debating on whether or not to tell him.
Dean bites back a sigh, taking a sip of his coffee as he watches him brush past Sam and out the kitchen. He frowns. The bastard made a pretty decent cup of coffee after all.
“I’ll get the rest of this stuff put away,” Sam says, reaching past Kevin for more groceries, “can you go get the kids up so we can eat before the food gets cold?”
“Has Dean been here?” Sam says, walking deeper into the library.
"So it's only happening with Cas?" Sam's brows furrow. "That's weirdly specific."
“Y‘sure you didn’t just want me to look like a giant bumblebee?” Dean teases, smiling at Cas. He gets a small, shy smile in return. “Thanks, Cas. It’s awesome.”
Cas hadn't been particularly chatty as an adult and he wasn't much chattier as a kid either; so it’s more than a little odd for him to be the one starting the conversation, let alone on such an unusual question.
bespelled.”
Dean’s jaw works as he glances away.
“Neither was I,” she replies, arms crossed. She was starting to get irritated, good.
“Let me help you clean up.”
“You got a pen?” Dean asks abruptly instead of answering. Wordlessly, Castiel hands a pen over to Dean, watching curiously as he scribbles something down onto his receipt.
Once that’s done, he moves on to mix up the pie filling. He’d used up most of the blueberries in his earlier attempts, there’s just barely enough left for one more try. He pours the filling into the tin and carefully lays out the strips of crust over it, crimping the edges like he’s been told he’s supposed to do.
Dean slants him a glance. “You wanna answer that?”
Dean takes a long pull of his beer before he answers.
“Pie,” Dean says shortly, frowning down at the counter. He sighs again, muttering to himself, “I’ll need to make a supply run.” Cas apparently still hears him somehow, because he can see the guy perk up in his periphery.
“I find that somewhat difficult to believe,” Cas replies. Which, considering their current situation not giving him any other option
So he turns too, half-expecting to be woken up from the dream he’s clearly in the middle of. His eyes land on Cas and he doesn’t wake up.
He takes a moment to pinch himself, just in case.
“I found a worm,” Cas says, pocketing the stone as he reaches down to pick up the worm.
“Hey Dean-o! Happy Valentine's Day!" Gabriel says cheerily. He steamrolls over Dean's confused, "Uh thanks, you too?" to ask, "So! Any special plans for this special day? Any special lady or lad?”
Dean sighs. “No. We’re working on it.”
"Castiel can't be too pleased about the fact that he's still here. Didn't Crowley try to kill him?"
“How is it?” Dean asks. He’s hardly touched his own plate, expression shifty as he watches them eat. Sam’s suddenly a little nervous about the delayed payback thought he brushed off earlier.
“Hey Cas, I wanted to ask-” Dean starts to say, walking into Cas’ room. His voice trails off when he sees Cas sitting on his bed, staring at what looked like an old shoebox in his lap with a fond expression on his face.
“Hey, Billie,” Dean says as nonchalantly as he can. “Wasn’t expecting-”
Dean scowls, closing the box roughly and setting it aside. “Yes, I’m sure. I didn’t actually look at any of this before taking it to Crowley so I didn’t realize it until just now.”
“There’s more coffee in the kitchen if you want.” He walks past Sam, heading for the nearest table stacked with books. “I found some more books we can look through while you were out. Go get warmed up so you can make yourself useful.”
Dean slips out of the bathroom, barely dodging the squirming teenager waiting outside who shoves past him, and heads up to the counter, keeping his back to their booth. There’s no one manning the counter, but Dean spots the waitress from earlier with another customer, chatting them up as she tops up their coffee. Noticing Dean waiting at the counter, she gives him a nod to let him know she’ll be right with him.
Cas is standing beside the dartboard, darts in hand with the twink standing far too close to him to be considered polite, leaning against the wall in what he probably thought was an alluring manner. Sam’s nowhere in sight.
“What?” Dean asks grouchily.
Dean looks offended at that.
Sam rubs at his eyes before leaning back and closing his book. “C’mon guys, time for bed.”
That finally merits a frown.
could go out and get wet but Dean and Cas couldn’t. Besides, they wouldn’t need a bath if they were playing in the rain. Sammy and Kevin didn’t think it was the great idea that it obviously was, but now that it’s not raining they
“So basically what you’re saying is you’re a chickenshit.”
“You asked me if we were friends before and I never answered that. Far as I’m concerned?” Sam gives a small shrug. “You’re family, Cas. You’re stuck with us.”
“I’ll wait until you actually tell me what’s wrong before I decide anything.”

“I’m not-” Dean splutters. Sam crosses his arms, giving him an expectant look. Dean quickly casts around through his beer-goggled memory of last night for an example that he wouldn’t need to elaborate on but got his point across.

point it out – and goes on.
He shrugs. “It’s what friends do.”
“And here I thought it was sheer dumb luck and the fondness of an erstwhile angel.”
He gets abruptly jolted back to reality when someone knocks impatiently at the door. Leveling another glare at his reflection, he points an accusatory finger at it. “Keep your shit together, Winchester.”
“What the- is that a Christmas tree? How did that even-?”

“No problem,” Sam replies, ruffling Cas’ hair. “Kevin and I are gonna head off to bed, so you guys better go to sleep at some point.”
I may or may not add a time-stamp or two to this, if the muse is so inclined.
Shit, shit, shit.
“No plans? Poor ol’ Cassie doesn't have any either, workaholic that he is. Maybe you can help him out?” Gabriel asks cheekily. Castiel scowls.
“So, does Cas even know about whatever you’re planning?”
Cas wanders back in a short while later, looking a little less like a worn doormat, two bottles of water in hand. He hands one to Sam.
His shoulders start swaying to the tune, his entire upper body moving along to the song. He continues shelving the books without stopping his half-dance. By the time the chorus comes back around his hips have started slowly shimmying from side to side.
“You thought I was leaving for good.” Cas continues staring at him, long enough that it starts to make Dean uncomfortable. “Did you want me to?”
“Skipping the pleasantries today I see.”
And man, what a face. He’s got a slightly scruffy look going that’s definitely doing him some favors, the slight frown he’s got doesn’t even detract from it. Probably his resting expression if Rick had to guess - wouldn’t be all that surprising considering the company he keeps. He watches as the guy brushes back a stray lock of hair drooping onto his forehead, hair spiking up slightly in front from the gesture. Even with the ‘absentminded professor’ vibe he’s giving off (and seriously, if he
, rolling his eyes at Dean. Setting it down, he says, “Look on the bright side.”
me what I’ve done that’s driven you to keep avoiding me, I could try and make amends-” Castiel pauses, watching as horror flashes through Dean’s eyes, his jaw clenching tight. It takes a few seconds to realize he must have prompted the truth compulsion to action once again.
“This weather sucks,” Kevin says the following day, frowning up at the rain pelting against the bunker’s high windows. “Seriously. We managed to get maybe two days since last week
“How are you not inebriated yet?” He asks sulkily and with the slightest bit of slurring, leaning heavily against the pool table. Dean’s almost certain he imagines the slight redness to his cheeks in the dim light of the bar.
"No," Cas says firmly. "I’ll help you find Dean."
Sam bites down on his lip, willing himself not to laugh or blurt out
. I’ve dealt with worse than this and I’ll take it for as long as I have to because I managed to do something big, Cas.”
“No,” Dean interrupts.
“Listen,” Kevin starts, “we can still keep-”
Cas mutters a ‘thank you’ to the bartender when his drink arrives, a large, bright, eyesore of a thing. He makes a quiet, satisfied hum as he sips at it, licking his lips as he sets it down, chasing down the lingering sweetness of the drink. The sight distracts Dean enough that he forgets to rib Cas about his taste in drinks.
For all that Castiel hadn’t actually talked about anything directly, the brief conversation with Sam helps improve his mood.
He bends down, moving to pick up the frame just as Sam reaches him. He pulls Dean aside, away from the broken shards on the floor. “It’s fine, it was an accident. Just, stay with Cas and don’t touch anything else.”
“You’re joking,” Kevin says, flatly. There’s no humor in Sam’s face to indicate he’s trying to pull a fast one on him. “…You’re not joking. What the hell happened?”
Kevin doesn’t answer for a long moment. He’s quiet for so long that Sam doesn’t think he’s going to say anything after all, almost flinching when Kevin rests a gentle hand on his arm. “I’ll stick by you.”
Charlie shrugs. “No clue. I think he headed back to his room after he hung up the tinsel everywhere.”
Baking is an art.
? Sure he’d caught himself thinking it more often lately, (well, it was usually ‘cute’, not ‘adorable’, not that that was any better) but those thoughts had always stayed in his head.
“You seemed frustrated earlier,” Cas repeats. “Would you like some help?”
He opens his mouth to announce his presence as he reaches the entryway to avoid getting shouted at again for accidentally spooking Dean into suffering another bruise and falters, almost running into the doorframe.
Cas shakes his head. “Not particularly. I understand it helps but I’d rather not dwell on it too much if it’s all the same to you.”
“So, ‘bee mine’?” He asks, raising his cup to show the incriminating words, as if Castiel could forget writing it.
"Woah there, killer," Dean says, coolly amused.
Dean doesn’t get a chance to tell him that it
“Any plans for tonight, darling?” Balthazar asks, brewing up a cafe latte and a frappuccino for the two young ladies chattering away at the counter.
“The feather has some traces of it as well, much less potent than whatever’s on the mirror, of course.”
Dean waves off the apology. “Why’s the Empty after you?”
Sam tries to bite back his relieved expression at that, one which Kevin doesn’t miss when he turns to him and says, “You’re helping. Think you can manage eggs and toast, Winchester?”
Sam glares at him from beneath wet bangs for a second before giving a huff of laughter. He reaches over for the shower hose and sprays water at Dean who screeches and tries to hide behind a still giggling Cas.
Before he gets the opportunity to stick his foot in his mouth again, Grumpy Male Model dude comes up behind the guy with a gruff, “Got everything you need, Cas?”
“You got something against ‘em?”
“Squirrel’s got no reason to play niceties with me. You on the other hand,” he hums, “maybe your relationship with your boyfriend’s finally reaching its end.”
“Uh, this morning, I guess?”
“Ice cweam!” Dean cheers.
Sam inclines his head in a half-nod. “That’s what I was texting you about earlier. It’s a bit of a reach since there’s not a lot of lore on it out there, but the hand mirror you guys found
Cas leans closer, allowing Dean to feed it to him. He’s relieved to find that the pie actually does taste good, the blueberry filling is deliciously sweet and not too goopy. As he'd assumed, the crust is somewhat overcooked, but not enough to detract from the overall flavor. It’s not quite Gabriel’s pie but it’ll do.
Instead of acknowledging any of that, Dean retorts, “You found a solution yet?”
“Uh-uh,” Dean tuts, calling Kevin’s attention hesitantly back from the mouthwatering dish before him. “Take a plate, kid.”
Cas hesitates, eyeing Sam before finally relenting. “He said I was adorable. But,” he continues before Sam can say anything, “he was also comparing me to a grumpy cat. It makes sense that he was trying to make fun of me in some manner.”
Sure he could tinker around with the other old beauties gathering dust there, but it’s not the same.
“If you have the time to snark, then you can try finding a weather manipulation spell in there while you’re at it,” Sam says shortly, closing his book with a thump. Kevin stares at him, brows raised.
There’s barely enough coffee in the carafe for one mug’s worth and it’s just a few steps above lukewarm, but he’ll take the caffeine however he can get it.
He could deny it.
Dean points at him. “Listen, buddy, you don’t just
“Shit.
“Had to bring stuff in from the car,” Sam says, stepping down into the kitchen. He takes a seat in the empty chair next to Dean’s. “I’m guessing you don’t need my help with the food.”
When he passes by Cas’ little work corner an hour or so later, he stills, watching him pull things off the shelf at random, gaze distant as he works.
starts playing as she goes back to digging through the pile of presents. She hums along as she grabs two packages, giving them a cursory shake before tossing the soft bundle to Sam, and the larger, heavier one to Cas.
“That’s not-” Dean says, trailing off when he sees the amused glint in Cas’ eye. “Ha ha, very funny.”
Cas shakes his head.
do that again, Dean,” Cas says, lower lip quivering in an effort to hold back whatever emotion was warring inside him.
“Then you can have it,” Sam replies, nodding at the plush toy with a smile. Cas stares at Sam for a few seconds before reaching out hesitantly, casting an uncertain look over his shoulder. Sam’s encouraging nod seems to be all he needs as he carefully pulls the toy out of the pile and hugs it close, arms wrapped around its soft round body as he gives a shy smile of gratitude to Sam.
Sam walks into the kitchen sometime later muffling a yawn. He pauses when he catches sight of Crowley and sighs. “Crowley.”
“It’s not under there,” Dean says, handing him a small rectangular shaped parcel wrapped in newspaper. “Sorry about the crappy wrap job.”
So... not only were Dean and Cas physically toddlers, it looked like they had the mental capacity to match. Saying nothing of where they stood on their memories.
“We managed to figure out which of the items was causing it,” Sam adds hesitantly.
Shifting awkwardly against the urge to make a break for it, Dean indicates the pool table. “We done here?”
“I used to be a babysitter for a while, back before all this,” he elaborates, waving his hand loosely to indicate what ‘this’ was.
work, but there’s as much risk of magical blowback.”
“Indeed I am,” Gabriel says, grinning. Castiel isn't entirely sure if that bodes well or not for Dean’s brother.
“No ma’am,” Gabriel responds innocently. “I was just giving Cassie here some advice.”
After his and Kevin’s unfortunate mishaps, Sam makes certain to check the weather reports before his next supply run, frowning when he sees the rain forecast for the rest of the week. “Does it still count as winter if you’re getting more rain than snow?”
Having successfully outfitted Cas and Dean in proper kids' clothes, he deposits the kids in the backseat of the Impala. Miraculously, he also manages to get the dead witch wrapped up in a sheet and out of the house and into the trunk without anybody catching him. At this point, he’ll take whatever luck he can get.
At Dean’s continued narrow-eyed look, Crowley relents, sighing a little theatrically. “Casting spells doesn’t always require that something be ‘original’, spell ingredients themselves notwithstanding. In fact, there’ve been many a knockoff made and bespelled to mimic the effects of the object that inspired it.”
thought tagged at the end.
Dean sighs. “Fine. Cas’ll take the basement. I’ll take the ground floor.” He turns to frown at Cas. “You got your gun?” Cas nods. “Good, make sure the safety’s on until you actually use it. And
Kevin grunts agreeably, mouth full. God, he forgot how good real food could be. Swallowing it down, he eyes Dean. “So, any reason for all… this?” He waves his hand vaguely to encompass the entire kitchen. “Not that I’m complaining,” he adds hastily, as Dean glances up at him.
“Apparently he got bored,” Dean tells him sarcastically with a shrug, not really in the mood to get into it.
Dean makes an agreeable noise, digging into his own burger. Mouth full, he says, “That, and you can never go wrong with a bacon cheeseburger.”
“Wait, so let me get this straight,” Charlie says, voice tinged with disbelief. “You guys got on a witch’s bad side; she got pissed and turned my handmaiden and his angel boyfriend into kids?”
Gabriel clutches at his chest, feigning hurt. “You wound me, Cassie." He directs big sad eyes and an over-exaggerated pout at Castiel. "I’m only looking out for my darling little not-brother.”
Cas raises his brows a bit, smiling slightly. It’s an expression almost eerily similar to Sam’s.
Large black tendrils envelop Cas at an alarming speed. Cas steadfastly ignores them, not looking away from Dean. “Thank you for-”
“Well,” Sam starts, then falters, brows pinching together. He’d bet good money that Cas was liable to be more careful than Dean as a given,
“Um,” Sam says, voice strangled from the attempt to not laugh. Oh, this was
Cas cocks his head, watching Sam with patient curiosity.
Sam sips at his beer thoughtfully. “A night out’s not a bad idea. It’ll be a good new experience for Cas too. Might even be enough to get Kevin to stick his head out of his room.”
“Uh-huh,” Sam responds instead, proud of the fact that it comes out sounding normal. Man, he wishes he could’ve seen how that conversation played out. Probably not well, considering Dean was the one who said it, but still.
Crowley huffs. “You know what I mean. Look, if all this hullabaloo we went through isn’t just a temporary reset switch for me, I’m not too keen on returning to hell and doing the process over, let alone staying locked in there with Abaddon and the rest. So it’s in both of our best interests, but especially mine, that I avoid chancing it. I’ll play nice, as required.”
“Actually, yeah. We think we might’ve found a counterspell, but we have a bit of a hitch. The spell calls for mermaid scales and that kinda thing isn't exactly easy to come by.”
Dean mumbles something under his breath as he reluctantly sits back up. Charlie either doesn’t hear it or ignores it as she heads for the door.
They find whatever books they can on spell breaking before hunkering down in the library, Sam and Kevin at one end of the desk, Dean and Cas on the other. The kids remain relatively well behaved, whispering occasionally to each other but otherwise quiet. They all go about with their work to the soundtrack of the occasional turning page and the sounds of crayons rubbing on paper.
Cas frowns thoughtfully for a moment before shaking his head. “Half,” he says, before remembering to tack on a “Please,” at the end. Sam bites back a smile as he pours Cas’ refill. He sets the carton on the counter and reaches for his coffee. He’s just about to take a sip when he notices the slight side-eye Kevin gives him while he manages the pans on the stove. Sam colors a bit as he straightens up, but Kevin rolls his eyes, turning his attention back to the stove, with a muttered “Plates,” in Sam’s direction. Sam moves quickly to comply.
"You could just kill him," Kevin suggests. It’s the most obvious solution, after all.
“There
Dean grunts. “Just answer the question.”
Castiel’s eyes narrow, reading between the lines. “The truth then.”
… Oh, this would be good, he was sure of it.
He stretches his legs out, feet bumping against Dean’s before crossing them at the ankle. “You can’t remember anything weird that stood out that day?”
It takes him a few moments to realize that, while he’d been busy trying to convince himself to actually do his not-so-terrible idea, the kids had vanished.
“Yes," Cas admits, fidgeting with his apron. "I was able to acquire the recipe for Gabriel’s pie from him.”
“Oh.” Cas blinks. “Okay then.” He follows after Dean, watching as he squats down and sticks his fingers right into the mud, bringing up a handful that he carefully deposits a little away from the edge of the puddle. He squats across from Dean, digging up a large mound of semi-solid mud from the edge and sets it down next to Dean’s little mud pile. “Like this?”
Cas doesn’t answer; it’s enough to make Dean quit his staring contest with the wall and sneak a peek at Cas’ face. He’s got a wary expression on his face as he eyes Dean, looking like he’s debating with himself over what to say. It takes Dean a moment to realize that maybe he’s a little bit afraid of what Cas might say. He’s not sure if he wants to hear it anymore.
“Yeah. I hope I did okay,” Sam says, rubbing the back of his head nervously.
Before Sam can answer, Cas comes into the library, expression troubled. He heads straight for Sam. “He wasn’t in any of the rooms.”
“Let’s go today.”
Cas stares at him quietly, Dean can pretty much see the gears turning in his head at having the decision tossed to him, at what it means. But the look he’s got on his face as he stares at Dean is so fucking soft that it makes him feel like he’s got a freaking horde of butterflies in his stomach.
Sam opens the door wider, looming large even as he leans against the doorframe. “I’m starving and you guys are sitting here chatting away. You promised me burgers, dude.” He blinks, suddenly becoming aware of the strangely tense atmosphere in the room.
“Oh. Thank you, Dean,” he says, brushing the flour off onto his apron. Before Dean can enquire into Cas’ curiously messy state, his attention is grabbed by the smell of baked goods lingering in the air.
“I don’t know,” Castiel admits. He knows it’s too much to expect forgiveness for his actions when he himself doesn’t feel deserving of it. Remembering Dean’s anger back then, he decides the least he deserves is an explanation. Whether it will make him feel better after isn’t important.
“What about the other items?”
There’s a swooping mix of relief and dismay in his gut at the realization that maybe he can spin this somehow, reroute this conversation before it crashes and burns their friendship with it.
“So, Cassie, is today gonna be the day you finally ask out the tall, blond, stud-muffin?” Gabriel asks, leaning back against the counter.
“I stand corrected,” Kevin replies sarcastically.
“Yes, you did,” Cas says, interrupting any apologies Dean might have attempted to voice.
“Soup’s on!” Dean yells down the hall.
“No, I must be mistaken.” Cas shakes his head. “He was likely just teasing me.”
Dean stiffens up at the news, grip tightening on his elbow.
Kevin and Charlie high five each other.
Cas’ irritable expression vanishes, morphing instead into bewildered confusion. Dean’s got no clue what’s got him looking so surprised.
Dean chuckles. “Well hey, at least your moves aren't too shabby.”
The woman turns around in confusion at the noise, flinching back when she catches sight of Dean. She stares at him, wide-eyed and scared before asking, “W-who are you? What’re you doing in my house?”
“Good, ‘cause I ain’t buying you a hundred burgers. I ain’t no rich sugar daddy.”
Kevin grunts, not looking up from his book.
Dean pauses. “You’re sure?”
“Don’t worry, Dean,” Cas says seriously, “I still like you.”
As a precaution, he makes sure his phone is set to vibrate before setting it aside. Dean’s probably gonna flip spectacularly when he sees it, but he won’t be able to do anything but angrily message Sam about it.
“I believe we’d been doing rather well with Dean’s aid initially. I didn’t realize he would be so busy as he is with household work,” Castiel says offhandedly. “I understand the bunker is significantly larger than an average home, of course, but I don’t recall him being anywhere near as busy when you were unwell.”
He slows when he reaches the kitchen, looming in the entryway, watching Dean prod at something on the stove while the nearby radio belts out some vaguely familiar-sounding rock song. Sam surveys the now-familiar sight of the mess of ingredients scattered around the kitchen with a frown.
“What? I’m good with kids and it was an easy way to make money when things were tight,” Kevin replies, biting into his sandwich. “Besides s’not like life’s as easy for us law-abiding citizens.”
“What’s going on,” Charlie says, walking into the room with mugs in hand, “is that it’s Christmas Eve and the bunker sorely needs more Christmas spirit.”
Kevin’s busy ignoring them, drinking his coffee with his eyes shut. Cas is seated a few chairs away, curled up and facing the Christmas tree, blinking sleepily.
Castiel feels his own jaw tighten painfully as his frustration starts to simmer hotter.
Dean half-shoves a plate of pancakes at Crowley before they decide to stand around talking or argue or whatever. Accepting it without comment, Crowley takes his sweet time grabbing the nearby bottle of syrup and pouring a generous helping on his breakfast. He raises his mug of coffee in a mock-salute at the brothers. “Have a good morning, boys.”
“May I join you?”
“Well,” Sam says with a half-smile, “I’m not hungover, but thanks for the water, I guess.”
With the end of May looming, they’ve just about resigned themselves to the fact that they might never break the spell. That is, until Kevin finally finds a solution.
“What were you doing in town?” Sam asks, brow furrowed.
“Seeing as the spell doesn’t seem malicious enough to injure, you
“Before you complain,” Kevin says, finally looking up, “they needed the fresh air. I could see ‘em starting to get stir-crazy.”
“How?” Dean says impatiently.
“Reheated leftovers?”
“You look good,” Dean says quietly, nodding at the sweater. He can’t help but notice how the blue of the sweater brings out Cas’ eyes.
Cas seems to catch onto Sam’s panicked expression before Dean does. He stops, looking uncertain as he glances back at an oblivious Dean, before turning back to face Sam. “We didn’t want to forget our clothes.”
“That
Sam starts chanting the incantation, voice getting steadily louder as he reaches the end.
It’s only once they arrive at Walmart that Sam realizes it'd be too risky leaving his de-aged brother and best friend in the car while he popped in to get what they needed. There’s no telling what they could get up to. He’d also
“No, no.” Sam smiles, shaking his head. “Hufflepuff suits you.”
“Negating spells are purifiers of a sort, ridding things with malicious effects or intent. The truth, uncomfortable as it may be, doesn’t quite qualify. Of course, I could have dispelled it with a snap of my fingers,” he says, underscoring the words with a loud
“Dean was just telling me that you make some amazing pies.”
. This was just a
Dean thinks for a moment, then grins. “I’ll get ta’ drive the car!”
“Ma’at,” Sam corrects. “And yeah, that was my guess too when I thought the mirror might belong to Veritas. But I got the feeling that he thinks they’re both knockoffs.”
Kevin raises a brow. “Which is it?”
restless, but it’s more from sitting around uselessly and not even being able to go on a damn jog while he recovers. Lying now is to preemptively cover his ass before Cas can question why. He doesn’t like having to do it, but he’s already dug himself deep enough that he’s hoping it’ll help hold back the mess once he has to climb back out.
the one overflowing with uncomfortable truths to confess.”
“Why?” Sam asks, a little suspiciously.
Crowley eyes him curiously. “What’s got your feathers ruffled today?”
“Yeah.”
“I want more with you,” Dean blurts out. “More than this stupid, awkward roommate shit we’ve been doing. Like an actual fucking relationship. Like you deciding you wanna stick with my sorry ass for however long we’ve got.”
When he turns back, Cas is barely a few feet away, the blueberry puddle on the floor the only thing dividing them. Dean flinches back reflexively, biting back another curse. Dude’s ninja skills were starting to get annoying now.
Dean shakes his head. “I mean it, Cas. It’s-” he puffs out a gust of breath, “shit I’ll deal with. It’ll go away on its own.”
Far as Sam’s concerned, other than Kevin’s ribbing, and the occasional child-sized tantrums, he’d say that things were going pretty well for them, all things considered.
“I want to believe you’d actually try to be better, but we haven’t survived this long by just hoping.”
Sam shrugs, unapologetic.
Castiel stares down owlishly at the piece of paper in his hand for a moment, wondering whether or not he’s dreaming that he actually has
He’s down to the last dishes when his phone alarm starts beeping. Wiping his hands off on the dishtowel, he quickly thumbs off the alarm and notices the message alert from Sam. The pop-up notification doesn’t show any text preview, just that it’s an image attachment.
Cas frowns. “What kind of fun?”
“Crap, I forgot to charge my phone yesterday.” Kevin frowns, chagrined, putting his phone away and getting back to making dinner for himself and Cas.
jealous about that, much. It’s not like he could match Sam in the brainy nerd-speak department that they both go off on.
“Kid?” Dean says warily. When he reaches out for him, Jack stiffens up at the touch. “Talk to me. What’s wrong?”
Dean rummages around in his pockets, tossing out some lint before he finally finds it. He quietly extends his hand, opening up his tiny fist to show what he’s holding. “I foun’ this. It’s blue, like your eyes.”
The brothers glance at each other, silently communicating. Well, more scowling from Dean and exasperated tiredness communicated through eyebrows and pinched lips from Sam. It’s more boring than amusing, honestly.
Sam mentally corrects, before forcing himself to move his thoughts in another direction in case Cas decided to continue this vein of conversation. They’re onto day five now, and the spell still hasn't worn off yet. Things are bound to come to a head eventually, and he
Still, he’d like to give Dean a kick in the ass at the very least for dragging this out.
“He’s… insistent?” Sam tries.
There’s no rhythm or order to his movements that he can discern, but it’s exhilarating. He never knew dancing could be so much
Wiping his hands dry, he grabs a beer from the fridge and heads for the library, figuring he’ll try and find something worth reading to kill some time.
be hers. It got me thinking; Veritas isn’t the only truth goddess around. We’ve got some items in the storeroom that match up with a similar kind of god or goddess from other pantheons. The mirror’s probably our best bet, but, assuming that the Men of Letters had cursed objects they didn’t know were cursed, there’s a chance it’s a feather or a signet ring.”
Ignoring the loud, nervous drumbeat of his heart, he meets Cas’ eyes. “I said it before, didn’t I? We’ve got enough space for a dozen of you in here with room to spare. So… stick around after. If you want.”
Sam sighs. “Fair enough. All that’d ever happen is small talk.” Cas wasn’t exactly gearing up to become the local gossip when he’s struggling to trundle through it now.
“No. No buts.”
Deciding he’ll take some time later to quietly freak the fuck out (
for longer than Castiel has worked there, one with a relatively predictable routine. He drops by at least three times a week – depending on whether or not he’s late for work and sometimes for lunch if he forgot his at home – but almost definitely on Saturdays, always just a little past noon for lunch after his half-day shift at the garage.
“I gathered as much from the line of questioning earlier,” Crowley replies dryly. Not a potion then, as he’d initially assumed. “I take it people are overflowing with uncomfortable truths to confess to you.”
Cas sighs like he can tell what Dean’s thinking.
“Of course,” Dean parrots sarcastically, quiet enough that Crowley opts to ignore it.
Dean’s left standing by himself, a few feet away from Sam, who's staring at him like he’s busy reassessing reality.
“Fine,” he says gruffly. “We’ll bring them by after dinner.” He jerks his head sharply in the direction of the door. “Let’s go, Sammy.”
“I’m… aware that I’ve not been the best of friends to you, or much of one really. I realize I’ve been preoccupied with adjusting to being human, but I had hoped that you would talk to me if something were troubling you.”
When he realizes Sam’s made no move to join them, Dean comes to an abrupt halt. Cas stops short just in time to avoid bumping into him.
“Yeah?” Sam asks, curiosity piqued. He’s seen his brother politely receptive to another man’s flirtations a handful of times, mostly when Dean didn’t think he was paying attention or near enough to really notice the interactions, but he’s also seen a few hilariously disastrous attempts of Dean trying to initiate the flirting himself. Not to exclude some particularly amusing attempts towards
Kevin inclines his head in acknowledgment. “Night, Sam,” he says, heading off to his room.
“Yes?” Stone-Cold Fox says, squinting at him. If it wasn’t for the squint, Rick would be able to see what was probably a pair of knockout blue eyes to go with the rest of him. It takes him a few horrifically long seconds after that to realize he got caught staring.
Dean straightens up in his seat, ready to object. “We’re not ti-” He interrupts himself with a huge yawn, “-red. Right, Cas?”
“What,” He replies shortly. Kevin stares up at him evenly. “You’re not going to make anything better going after him like this.”
“We should head back,” Cas says instead, not looking at Sam.
“Thanks, Sammy.” Dean takes a few sips of soup. “Iz’ good”
“I like to think so.” Kevin huffs. “You go give them a shower; I’ll clean up the mud you guys are tracking around.” He closes the book he was reading and heads off to get some cleaning supplies.
Kevin sighs, rubbing the sleep away from his eyes as he wanders past them to get himself some coffee. He leans against the counter, grimacing slightly as he takes a sip of lukewarm coffee. “Guess you better start learning.”
“Speaking of, where is he anyway?” Sam asks.
There’s an uncomfortable silence in the car as they back out of the diner’s parking and onto the main road. Dean blindly turns the radio on to the first half-decent sounding station he can find, eyes intently focused on the road.
“We need t’check your heart too, make sure it’s okay,” Dean says, handing the stethoscope over to Cas. He puts the earpieces into his ears and then places the resonator at Sam’s breastbone over his t-shirt and listens for a few seconds, frowning.
the truth is kinda ironic. “The trials very nearly killed you, Sam.”
Crowley smirks. “If you’re offering.”
“It’s Christmas,” Cas responds with a yawn. He takes a sip of the coffee and hums quietly. “I believe waking up early to herald the day is part of the tradition.”
“I, that is-” He stutters. Cas looks away, shoulders slumping. Dean stops, staring down at his own hands gripping at the fabric of his jeans in a white-knuckled grip.
