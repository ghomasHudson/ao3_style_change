thought Mycroft, helpless in the face of such easily given affection. Not to mention the outright temptation. Mycroft swallowed hard, feeling the heat building in his face. Thank God it
He looked at Sherlock, who was reading him carefully even as these thoughts passed through John's head. Knowing this, John smiled and he dived into the unknown. He watched Sherlock's face as he slid his hot palm up to the top of his open shirt, and then his other hand, and then with both hands he popped open the third and fourth and fifth buttons gently, his hands moving slowly downwards, his eyes never leaving Sherlock’s face. Sherlock’s eyes as he watched John’s face were simply mesmerising.
John looked down at the slip of paper. "In love," he announced, rather amused. Mycroft certainly got his own back with that one. He thumped the table and roared with laughter, much in the manner of Agatha earlier. John had never seen him laugh quite like that before, and he looked over at him, delighted, grinning wildly.
Greg looked down quickly, a strange expression flashing across his face, as if he were embarrassed, and put his knife and fork together neatly. He pushed them slightly to the left so they lay centrally, straight on his plate, at half past twelve. He raised his gaze back to Mycroft. “Well…I s’pose we’re doing it now, eh?” he said slowly. His dark eyes smouldered and his words were laden with suggestion. Hence the odd look on Greg’s face a moment before, realised Mycroft suddenly. He hadn’t been embarrassed  at all - he’d just immediately thought of that little innuendo and had been wondering whether to say it or not. Mycroft also saw, in an instant, that Greg’s deciding to say it and him responding positively now would be the start of something else.
it!?” he asked. ‘Stilton at three!’ he was thinking. At that age, John’s favourite cheese was Primula mild cream cheese spread with little pieces of ham in it - it had come in a metal tube like a toothpaste tube.
he thought. A Holmes deducing a Holmes was a sight worth seeing. But if Mycroft gave an acidic response to Sherlock, John missed it, because then Agatha turned to him while walking and - seemingly randomly - asked if he liked dogs. When he said he did generally, yeah, she immediately and enthusiastically started telling him about her two darling fat pugs back home, Bunty and Claude.
By the time he got to Tesco’s - in fact, way before he’d even got through the automatic doors - he had been bombarded by Valentine’s Day merchandise everywhere and the incessant prompting to buy some of it for his Valentine…John didn’t really go for all this ‘Valentine’s day celebration’ stuff, he couldn’t help but feel it a cynical commercial attempt by the shops to simply extract more money from everyone now the enforced austerity of January was over, but all the same, he thought it might be a nice surprise to get
And then John had come along. And when John had come along, at first he had just been someone new to show this ability off to, but quite quickly Sherlock saw how very different John was. And how John saw
They were not seen by a teenager fresh out of medical school. They got through triage quickly (mid morning Wednesdays were never that popular, after all) and they were seen fairly fast by an experienced surgeon covering an A&E shift. John was gratified to see that she was very, very competent and very, very efficient. The Stanley knife had not pierced Sherlock's lung tissue, all major arteries and veins were intact and there was no nerve damage, so thankfully it was all ok. The contusion to John's head was examined and he was carefully checked and pronounced ok too, but that wasn't really what he had been worried about anyway.
John clenched his fists tighter, folded his lips together and lifted his chin defiantly. So, they had gone full circle and here they were, right back at the beginning again, in the same place. But unlike that awkward conversation at Angelo's, after this, nothing was ever going to be the same again. Their friendship was going to be over in a final embarrassing mess of rejection and denial and he was just waiting for Sherlock to say the words and then he would leave. Leave him with the mess this time.
was over? The whole game, the whole shebang...John decided maybe he was concussed. His brain was everywhere this morning.
pleased to have you here!" said Mrs. Holmes enthusiastically and even with the Bickering Brothers glowering at each other behind her in the background, John still felt cheered. He had immediately felt more welcomed and wanted here than he had done in anyone else's house for a long time. He handed her the now slightly travel-worn and crumpled bunch of flowers.
John was amazed to find out just how much his body knew what it wanted. And it was very certain about it indeed. There was nothing unsure about this kiss either…and Jesus, it was just so…fucking…
John hesitated to say exactly what had been on his mind. “But mine’s further away from Mrs. H…if we get…ah…if it gets noisy…” replied John.
Greg grinned at him as he came back into the bedroom. “Your wish is my command, then,” he replied. Then he sat up, flinging off the duvet again, and added, “I’ll be right back. Help yourself to a shower, but don’t go anywhere!”
and he reached up fast to capture Sherlock's face in his hands and hold him there, the tips of his fingers delving into Sherlock's hair. That kiss had suddenly said everything. It said everything that they hadn’t yet had a chance to say. Sherlock's arms came up more possessively around John's body and John realised in an instant that he had never thought it would
Sherlock opened his mouth and after a moment, some words came out of it. "I...I've just worked something out. Something that's...been on my mind for...for some time...I've just realised what it is."
“Ooh, lovely, Sigs,” said Agatha gratefully at the idea, taking a big slurp of her second glass of sherry and nearly finishing it in the process. “Hang on a tick though, let me just put my cases next door at Jilly's and I must do Zsa-Zsa and Sofia’s drops.”
It turned out that she was the elderly next-door neighbour’s widowed younger sister, and a frequent visitor there. Agatha was due to stay at her sister's house next door, cat-sitting the elderly sister's elderly sibling cats whilst the sister herself was up in Scotland visiting her grandchildren for Hogmanay. When the senior Holmeses had heard about this plan, they had immediately invited Agatha round to join them for their traditional New Year's Eve dinner.
above board - and what’s more, if you two pair of tits think I’m fucking going down without a fight, you’ve got another fucking think coming!…You two can fucking well go and
John almost laughed at that with a pure explosive joy. On impulse, he turned his face and almost involuntarily, kissed the side of Sherlock's neck, at the point where his mouth was level, without even thinking about it; he was so glad to have him back. And perversely, suddenly so intensely grateful to Mary that she had both freed him
Not wishing to display any signs of weakness to their two captives, John looked at him very carefully. He caught Sherlock's eye and raised his eyebrows, inclining his head slightly at Sherlock to ask, 'You ok?'
Fiercely, passionately, hot and hard, they kissed each other. Their hands swept over each other's bodies like the sweep of hungry flame over dry wood. John slid his hand slowly down the front of Sherlock's lean body again and felt him gasp into his mouth. He drew back once more and looked into Sherlock's eyes and saw that something truly momentous was happening right now. This was entirely different, and both of them knew without question that there was no going back from this.
They kissed each other passionately, their bodies striving to get even closer, their hands roving; on chests, on backs, down shoulders and arms...eventually they broke for breath again, and Greg stroked his fingers back and down through Mycroft’s hair as they separated. When he looked at him, Mycroft could see immediately that Greg was worried about something. “What is it?” Mycroft asked quickly, but with some reservations as to what the answer might be.
Sherlock moved out of the way, and held the door open, and John came in like he was Mycroft’s East Wind itself, like a sombre harbinger of doom, and Sherlock shut the door behind him very quietly and carefully. John’s silent fury was palpable, it tainted the air of the hallway. Walking up the stairs behind him, Sherlock read everything in John's slow, hard, deliberate steps, so that by the time they reached Sherlock's flat, Sherlock already knew what John was going to say.
needed stitches. But what if Sherlock hadn't blocked the blade? What if it had gone in between the clavicle and first rib and pierced or even severed Sherlock’s subclavian artery? The only way to compress that vessel and even hope to repair it was to open up the chest…what if the stab wound had been  there instead and left Sherlock dead at the scene within minutes?
, but as this problem primarily involved himself first, he would need to go backwards and start from there.
however, clearly liked John. It purred loudly and rubbed its head against his leg repeatedly. It was a very pretty cat - long haired, grey and white, and with very tufty ears.
Gabriel Peters is not a real person, nor is Gabriella Peters, or Clarissa. But I wish the last two both were, I like them a lot. Peter Gabriel is
- and although at the beginning of this little escapade, he had genuinely just wanted some ideas for what he could put in his blog and had been hoping for something that he could clean up and make into a good, usable and expletive-free sound bite, he was also quite tired and had a headache, was frustrated and pissed off, and Sherlock was being evasive about something John wanted to know and particularly bloody annoying full stop this morning anyway…so although, yes, he
Sherlock raised his eyebrows. “Indeed!” he confirmed. He looked back down at the screen again and shook his head. He was surprised too, but clearly he was also secretly pleased. “You know, John, I think I might actually take a screenshot of that for blackmail purposes…” he said, adding, “…he might delete it once he’s had a moment to think about it.”
him tell me.’ He was still really pissed off about the whole eye-cup-fry-up fiasco. John sat forward in his chair and deliberately let his volume control slip up a notch.
The train from London Liverpool Street into rural East Essex was one of the older ones, tired looking and a bit clackety. Sherlock complained about the age of it.
For Sherlock, those words embodied everything that had attracted him to John in the first place. ‘Could be dangerous’ he'd said, not so much a warning but an invitation, or a test. John hadn’t even asked what the danger might be, he had just come; instantly. To be at Sherlock's side. To face the danger, whatever form it might take. That had said worlds about John Watson, then. As it did this time, when John said those same words back to Sherlock, knelt poised above him, half naked, ready to change his whole life in an instant with Sherlock once again.
things, or used that word to describe his measure of enjoyment. He appreciated good tailoring, and the feel of silk against his skin in the form of a shirt or underwear, he relished the joy of getting a difficult sonata exactly right. He rather enjoyed a good storm. But
He followed Sherlock up the stairs and they turned left and left again into the bedroom above the sitting room. So Sherlock had been playing his violin in the room that was to be John's, directly above John's head as he sat downstairs. As this thought went through John's mind, Sherlock read it in his usual way and explained, "The sound is very pure in here. It's the wooden panelling on the walls."
“Oh, are we dressing for dinner?” he asked, slightly aghast, glancing over at Sherlock, who only looked back at him rather blankly. “Ah…I haven’t brought any smart clothes,” John continued, “I’ve only got really casual things with me.”
Ok, my sweets, just to pre-warn you - this chapter starts with some of the graphic canon events of The Reichenbach Fall, and what happened in canon immediately afterwards, so be prepared.
“Is that what I am to you, a challenge?” Mycroft asked, raising one eyebrow, good humouredly. But he wasn’t sure if that was all he wanted to be.
So at that, John laughed for real and went over there, and over the next three-hot-and-steamy-quarters of an hour later, Sherlock told him
and on being released, who had he wanted to go to? There was only one person. He had gone back inside the silent flat only for his coat, his wallet, his phone and his keys, and then he had slammed the front door closed and started walking.
He began to want to show off to John and to impress John and he had realised he wanted...he actually wanted John to
Greg lifted his head from the pillow and kissed him lightly and repeatedly, growing more passionate and intense each time, and Mycroft returned the kisses, their ardour increasing. Mycroft moved closer and over Greg, and eventually his long limbs entangled Gregory possessively with no intention of letting go.
“Yeah, well, I’m not just a pretty face, you know,” said John casually, the glow in his chest not just due to the excellent scarf around his neck.
Greg stopped moving. He kissed him briefly and came up off him a bit onto his elbows and forearms. “What?’ he said. He was panting.
Mycroft, all at once, delighted with this new, previously un-deduced knowledge of his lover and amused by Greg’s total understanding and acceptance of the Holmes’ brothers’ trait - one which most people found disturbing and odd - found himself enjoying being ordered about. Very much so, in fact. It seemed he and his brother had more than one thing in common.
So, without a word, John moved over to give Sherlock some room, and Sherlock stood up again and turned the duvet back and he slid silently into the bed, the sound of his silk dressing gown sliding on John's rough cotton sheet, and then he brought the duvet back up over them both again. The pain and faintness in John's head had vanished like a dream as soon as Sherlock had sat on his bed. Now all he was aware of in his own body was his heart pounding and the heat of Sherlock next to him. Sherlock was lying on his back, and his shoulder and hip fitted comfortably against the length of John's spine. John had his knees bent up in the foetal position, but he could feel the side of Sherlock's calf hot against the sole of one of his feet. He tried to breathe normally and found it difficult. Sherlock was not, as a rule, given to hugs and shows of affection, and although John was, he was so
in the sack.” The smile that rose up across his face then was as beatific a one as any Renaissance painting Mycroft had ever seen. Mycroft had been thinking far more romantic-poet thoughts about the experience than the one Greg had just voiced, but he laughed. “Well, thank you. I think,” he said, but he was unoffended, unabashed, utterly charmed.
Sherlock sat down smartly at the table and picked up the paper again. He turned straight to the obituary pages. “Good. You’re making tea. Love some,” he said smugly to Mycroft, not looking at him, scanning the columns as he spoke.
thought John, almost delirious with joy but no longer laughing, looking down at Sherlock in something like wonder. ‘This is
one to the dry cleaners…’ thought John with a snort of amusement. There was a moment of awkwardness when John realised it would make sense to just strip off completely and walk downstairs to the shower naked - he often just slung his dressing gown on to go down to have a shower in the mornings, but to do that now seemed coy somehow after what they'd just done. He took his jeans off and while he was just in his pants dithering about grabbing his dressing gown, he realised Sherlock had simply taken his trousers off and hung them over his arm, and was standing in his pants, waiting for John. John turned to look at him. Sherlock smiled. He wasn't at all shy. ‘Well - you’re the one who walks round in a sheet,’ thought John; of course Sherlock wasn't shy about walking around the flat practically nude. John folded his jeans loosely and laid them on his bed. He turned to face Sherlock.
“A’course it is!” Greg said roundly. “D’yer like doughnuts? Want me to go and get some?…I really fancy a doughnut or six right now.”
Last note: If you're going to buy crackers, get luxury ones, as they are the only ones that have 'gifts' worth keeping. Here's a link to them if you really haven't a clue what they look like.
Mycroft thought he might faint. There surely couldn’t be enough blood in his brain to keep him on his feet right now. He had upwards of maybe 90,000 words at his disposal, in many different languages, and only one came out.
John was then informed, over some freshly-made clementine mince pies produced hot from the Aga by Siger and a desperately needed cup of tea supplied by Lucia, that a Great Aunt Agatha was to be joining them later for dinner.
It didn’t make any sense. But Sherlock couldn't speak to ask him. He didn't even know what to say. He didn't want to hear John describe the pain of his broken heart and his love for Mary, and he thought his voice would only betray his jealousy. He could only keep his hands and arms across John's shoulders and on the back of his neck, and be there for John, and wait.
“Oh, that's the one," Sherlock said, waving his hand dismissively. “Don't know much about yachts, know more about pirate sloops and 18th century galleons—”
If he closed his eyes, he could see the nine words he had spoken in bright white Times New Roman font circling around and around. As if he had just seen them as a headline in the newspaper he was holding. He mentally waved them away, he couldn't think with that…
This had been so long in the waiting, it actually seemed more than as if they were just two people finally acknowledging their feelings, or just two people reunited after a long enforced absence. It was so much more. As his body collided full length with Sherlock's in a fierce and violent embrace, John thought disbelievingly,
It was over-whelming and terrifying. And a part of him was also vaguely aware that they were right in front of the window. But then Sherlock brought his hand up from John's neck to the side of John's face, and slid his fingers round and spread them in John's hair, the ball of his thumb cupping soft on the angle of John's jaw, and he leaned forward and down to John and John could have no doubt about his friend's intentions.
he indicated where both abrasions were with a light touch close to each. "At least you don't need A&E for this one," he remarked, smiling now.
Sherlock obeyed instantly. And with great relish. He elongated the 'f' sound to draw the word out from its single syllable status, and drawled the last three letters into a low-sounding, rumbling growl with the harsh kick of the 'k' at the end. He pronounced the word like it was the name of a rare Anglo-Saxon delicacy, being placed with great ceremony on a feast table before a king.
John knew he had never read that book in front of Sherlock, but hearing him describe that image of John reading it was so accurate, it was as if he had sat there and watched John do it.
. The fact that John had accepted it all as normal behaviour as well she seemed to find mildly amusing.
John almost yelled from the doorway, still catching his breath, adrenaline pumping, as Sherlock stood ineffectively waving the folded newspaper at the smoke alarm, pre-empting its pending decision to possibly start alarming, but half-heartedly, knowing it only would if it thought it really needed to. And ok, there wasn't really that much actual smoke for it to get upset about anyway, true, but the stench was indescribable. Sherlock did not so much as bat an eyelid at John’s chaotic appearance. “Just conducting an experiment on how high temperatures affect the cornea,” he supplied breezily. “Been thinking about the effects of exposure to extreme heat on the human body. However, I do think I may have slightly overdone the temperature/length of heat exposure ratio.” He swirled over to the microwave.
John digested that. 'Knowledge is power,' he thought wildly. His head was suddenly pounding again and he felt a bit faint. Maybe it was remembering being shot. Remembering seeing his blood pooling in the dust again as they dragged him backwards, away from his own rifle which Smithy had grabbed up and was using frantically, swearing abuse at the insurgents he was firing at. The noise was as if all the harpies of Hell had been let loose around them. John remembered seeing the trail of blood he was leaving behind him as Murray dragged him back under the line of fire, back to the safety of the foxhole. How very dark red the blood had been, curling a graceful question mark shape in the dust, and how he had watched his useless hand at the end of his suddenly useless arm drag through the blood and the dust and the sand, and bump over a stone. He’d tried to reach round and press the fingers of his other hand against the open mess that had been the back of his left shoulder, to stem the flow of blood, and he'd thought,
“Right,” she announced in passing, “I’m just going to do hair and make up repairs and get changed!” This gave John a momentary wobble.
- with this wonderful man. So really, he should be extremely grateful to Sherlock for…setting this up.
John noticed Mycroft’s shoulders tighten. “How very observant of you,” Mycroft replied drily, not looking around at Sherlock either and emptying the now warmed pot out into the sink with a brisk, slightly aggressive flick. “Perhaps you would be so kind as to help by getting some fresh milk? I believe the jug on the table is nearly empty.”
“Essex, apparently,” replied Sherlock, glancing sideways at John, and John knew he was impressed. John couldn't help his quiet glow of pride.
- what's happened?" he asked in concern, getting up from the desk, all his irritation at Sherlock's disturbance vanished.
he exclaimed, mortified, putting the glass down quickly further back from Mycroft and instantaneously finding the washing up sponge was the closest. He snatched it up and let go of Mycroft, veering away from him to perform the rescue operation. He quickly scooped up the little stream and wiped around the puddle, glancing down in dismay at Mycroft’s trousers. “Oh Jesus, Mycroft, I’m really sorry!” he said. “Let me get you something to put on it, I’ve got some—” he leaned to the side to toss the saturated washing up sponge into the sink.
That chaste kiss of joy on Sherlock's neck had started something in John, something inside him had lit up with a brilliant bright flame and suddenly John wanted more. John could hardly believe it all himself - but was this not the day for earth-shattering revelations? He might not be able to say it yet, but he could think it.
It worked - a bit - Mycroft’s lips curled upwards just the tiniest amount, but he still looked slightly awkward.
When Agatha saw Mycroft, she suddenly lifted a hand to get his attention and stop him before he came any further into the room. “Mycroft, “ she said quickly, "could you remind your father to get the pudding wine out of my wine box and put it in the fridge, quick? It should be chilled and I damned well forgot to do it before I sat down!”
Sherlock stared at John and put the offending cup down on the table carefully and deliberately, still staring at John coldly. He turned the cup around so the word
with the words said in his own voice came back into his head and it revolved around a bit. And it kept revolving. Oh, it was so
Sherlock paused with his mouth just inches away from John's, and John thought, 'He's waiting for this to be my decision too,' and he flicked a glance from Sherlock's mouth up to his eyes and this time it was he who read Sherlock's mind. He saw the question there in Sherlock's eyes and he knew the answer in his heart instantly.
Gabriella continued, starting to collect her brushes and wiping them on a strip of rag. "With the money we made on our parents' house, I was able to pay off his debts and clear his name, and I supported him financially while he went into a retreat, and from there, joined Gamblers' Anonymous. When he came out of it all, he wanted a fresh start.” She stopped wiping and looked at them both. “And quite frankly, so did I! I didn’t want his money - I don’t need it - so in exchange for the debt he offered me his artist’s identity. He had always wanted to emigrate to Australia and get away, but my mother would never have let him go without a fight. He couldn’t go when our parents were still alive, but once they were gone, he was free. And so he went. He now lives in Sydney, Australia, with no debts at all in this country and he has created a new life as a sculptor out there under a different name, and I have a completely anonymous wonderful life here as a painter and writer.” She bent and started to pack away her paints and thinners as she spoke. “I don’t want all the fuss and fanfare, thank you very much. I just want to enjoy my life. Which is painting and writing.” She shut the little carrying box and looked up at them both to judge their reactions.
come from you!” and Sherlock’s laughter as he typed it out followed John all the way into the kitchen.
Sherlock lifted a hand in farewell as he passed through the archway front gate and he said it once, but was not nearly as effusive in saying his goodbyes as John was.
The National Trust: If a building or structure is Grade II listed, it means it has protection from being demolished, significantly altered or developed, due to its irreplaceable historic value. The National Trust is a real organisation in the U.K. that preserves such historic buildings, gardens and land for the future, and has many Grade II listed buildings on its books, but the fisherman's shed and the pier I mention only exist in my mind. (In the U.S., the National Trust exists but it is known as The Royal Oak.)
Deliberately. He had simply spoken the words exactly how Alex Burson had, but in his own voice. To get John back for calling him an idiot and a cock. To shock him. And hearing Sherlock
“Oh, ages ago,” replied Sherlock, finishing his text and putting his phone back onto the bedside table as he stood up. “Come on, John, I want tea,” he said abruptly. “Let’s go back downstairs,” and he walked towards the door.
“I—ah—I didn’t quite know how to….erm…politely refuse!” Mycroft confessed, glancing at him, relieved.
he gasped. He clutched at Sherlock and wove his fingers into his hair and held him there and there was a short spell of time when John could barely even

to all of it.” Mycroft glanced up at him. He had one arm up behind and under his head, his face was flushed, his hair in disarray of its normally neat swept up and over manner, and as Mycroft watched, Greg brought his other hand up and scrubbed through his already wild hair, his eyes closed, his mouth slightly open.
“You haven’t seen her when Mycroft starts stealing vol au vents,” said Sherlock clearly, knowing his brother was right next door in the study, with the door wide open.
John smiled and was about to answer in the positive when Sherlock, who had grown tired of this very civilised exchange and felt he hadn't even had a chance to speak to John yet, snapped, "Yes, yes, yes, all well, we're all very well. Any news, John? There's absolutely no phone reception up here."
yourselves!’ ” Sherlock said it all like he was reciting some lines that he had learnt for a play, with a hearty emphasis on the particular words where Alex Burson had put his own hearty emphasis. There was a split second of shocked silence and then he pushed his chair back from the table loudly in a violent movement, still staring straight at John. He stood up abruptly, then shoved the chair back in place under the table and turned and stalked over to the window. He glanced out of it for no apparent reason and then turned around into John's slightly wide-eyed, stunned and frozen silence and air that had suddenly turned rather a shocked shade of blue. Sherlock tipped his head a little to indicate that there was more to come, and then he took up the reins again, but this time, he spoke in a much calmer tone. “…I then reminded him that blackmailing his daughter-in-law to sign the trust over to him wasn't
Greg grinned and delivered, lowering his glass. “So I can shove ‘im up against the wall and show ‘im who’s boss.”
Lucia was by then emptying her peelings into a green compost caddy on the kitchen worktop. As she brushed the last bits off her hands, she glanced at him and said casually, “You took your time…!”
But Mycroft had managed to not let go of Greg completely, only relaxed his hold for Greg to move. “—No, don’t worry,” he said quickly, loathe to stop what they were doing for a mere splash of whisky on his Ozwald Boateng trousers.
that.” His voice was low and gravelly. His eyes lingered for a moment and then he hung Mycroft’s jacket on the back of the chair, quickly but carefully, and turned back to the worktop to pour them both a second scotch and then add some water.
Mycroft smiled at the sight. He had never really felt the urge to smoke first thing in the morning on waking, even when he
Mycroft could feel himself grow warm again. In his face and…elsewhere. People did not tell Mycroft Holmes to
Just then, Siger came bursting into the room through the back door, laden with a huge, thick wicker basket full of split logs and kindling. The blast of air that came in with him and the logs was icy and sharp, and it carried the smell of the snow that had been forecast that morning. “Brrr! Jolly freezing out there!” declared Siger happily, shoving the heavy back door firmly shut with his behind and putting the over-loaded log basket down next to the doormat. He hoicked off his wellington boots and replaced them with his ready and waiting sheepskin slippers, setting the boots neatly down by the back door. Then he turned to the assembled group and said, “Well! Are we all excited for the Old Year’s Night? The heralding in of the New Year?” He rubbed his hands together gleefully.
Sherlock looked at those gently curving lips and his heart leapt with an unashamed joy and desire of his own.
she said delightedly, grinning, and shaking it at him. “My favourite colour…!” she added, in a lower tone, and then she leaned in close to John and paused significantly, as if wishing to impart some piece of confidential information.  He leaned in obligingly, discreetly giving her his ear.
- either what he had put John through or how John would feel when he realised Sherlock was alive after all. Sherlock had only begun to understand after, when he was alone, wiping the blood from his face in the empty street, watching the taxi with John and Mary inside it disappear away into the night. Only then he had begun to understand how John felt.
“Oh, good - well, it seems you just have!” mumbled Sherlock, crossing his arms. He didn’t sound very happy about it.
Mary, whom Sherlock had not anticipated. And so things had not gone to plan, not at all. Nothing had gone to plan.
Gregory Lestrade was such a noisy lover. And the language! Mycroft didn’t have that much experience, but he had never had an experience like this one. It was as dirty as dirty talking got. Greg was as free and easy in vocalising his enjoyment as he was at making Mycroft laugh, and Mycroft loved
come and he had come for them both. So, forced into a corner, John had said that he forgave Sherlock. He had only said it then because he truly thought at that moment that this was it, and they were going to die together.
Sherlock sipped his own drink for a moment and then said off-handedly, “Oh, just Mycroft exaggerating.”
Obediently, Mycroft turned straight back around, slipped past Sherlock and went off to do it. Possibly glad for an excuse to get out of the room, thought John, taking a sip of his own wine. Sherlock sat down opposite John in his allotted place, and immediately he did so, of course he noticed the tiny sprig of holly nestled in his glass. John watched him eyeing it, but he didn’t say anything, not wanting to spoil Lucia’s secret joke. Suddenly Sherlock looked up at John, his narrow-eyed knowing look saying clearly
He watched Sherlock and said nothing, and thought about all the possibilities in which Sherlock could be hurt or even die, until he had to stop torturing himself, and then he made himself think methodically and clearly about how the hospital would examine and treat Sherlock's injury until he was in control of his emotions again. By then they had pulled up in the drop-off bay at St. Thomas' hospital and he felt better.
“Well, that's good,” Sherlock replied, his own voice a dark rumble, “because I rather find that I liked doing it to you…” and as he spoke, he went to work on John's ear and neck.
"What's the matter? Is it what he said about…” Sherlock gestured delicately between them both with his hand as he spoke, “…what he said about...you and I?" He clearly meant the 'fucking boyfriend' thing.
the sound carrying clearly through the house. John and Sherlock heard Siger guffaw in delight and reply loudly,
John's almost silent weeping was like a force of nature, of destruction to Sherlock, and it absolutely destroyed Sherlock to watch it. He slid bonelessly off his chair as if in a dream, and stood up. He crossed the tiny space between them to reach John, and stood in front of him. Helpless, he had gone straight to John. Helpless, he extended a hand down for what seemed like miles to reach John's shaking shoulder, and then he gripped it, as firmly as he dared. John moved, fast as a feral cat, and flung his arms around Sherlock's body and pulled him in, and he buried his face in Sherlock's stomach to hide the pain on it, or so Sherlock thought. He found the hand that he had put on John's shoulder slid round onto his back, and the other moved slowly, drawn down to cup the back of John's neck, and his hands stayed there and could not move. Sherlock hugged John back like this, as best as he was able to in their awkward position. So he found he had known exactly what to do all along. He thought he should hold John like this until John wanted him to let go.
Greg leaned back against his kitchen counter again, put his glass down and loosened his tie. He undid his top button but left the tie on. Mycroft thought his mouth might water. Just looking at him made Mycroft want to loosen his own tie. As a distraction, he swirled the last of the thick amber liquid gently in his glass and watched it circle lazily around.
sang his internal voice gleefully as he indulged himself by running his fingers through Gregory’s gorgeous silver hair again and again.
get off your phone, darling!’ He must have been washing those bowls very quietly, John realised, as there was no sound of it happening. At Lucia's words, however, there was immediately a loud metallic clattering from the downstairs loo sink and the sound of scrubbing and rinsing, and then Siger called back, “I’m done!”
he thought with glee, saying easily, “Not particularly…I’m what you could call free as a bird this morning…”
“Of course I’m not comparing you to Judi Dench! She’s nowhere near as 'ot as you! You’re nothin’ like ‘er!” Greg grinned and bit into his own toast with a huge crunch.
Eventually John took a breath that was weak and shaky, looked at Sherlock and he spoke like he was repeating a message he had been told to give. "The baby's not mine," he said quietly, matter of factly. "I'm not the baby's father…Mary’s...she's not…” he looked up at the ceiling. “...Uhnnn….she’s been...with someone else, almost all along.” He looked back at Sherlock, and gripped the arms of his chair. “She was...with someone before…” he paused for a long time and then he started again. “It’s
So maybe we don’t, but that’s still no reason to use it for recklessly incinerating human remains at six o’fucking clock in the morning!” snapped John.
Although it was actually she who had bumped into Sherlock, she jerked away, barked, "Why don't you watch where you're going, freak?" and swept on down the corridor past him.
John smiled at that briefly despite the situation. He knew Sherlock had just gone to supposedly suss out a restaurant owner suspected of money laundering and other financial crime, but, hey ho, apparently he had managed to get embroiled in a kitchen scrap and had come home with a knife wound.
The way John drove him mad with his not-thinking, with his inane questions, with his tidy tidiness when all Sherlock wanted was some chaos around him to be able to think clearly... But then, sometimes John being around was like Sherlock having his own lightning conductor. John sometimes had the ability to ask exactly the right question that would focus Sherlock's raging electrical storm of nearly-but-not-quite-knowing into a single point of light, a beam of energy that shot down and hit the ground and engulfed him and became him suddenly
It wasn't like he hadn't seen this sort of thing before - it was often used as a ruse by couples who had neglected to buy their tickets before boarding the train, had spotted him coming, and were trying to avoid getting caught and fined a penalty charge - but there was just something very honest and joyful -
“Oh, well, he…ah…he knows Sherlock and he’s an old friend of John’s. That’s how I—er, never mind.” Greg had picked up on Mycroft’s thoughts. “Yeah, well, anyway, we smashed a massive case together,” he explained. “A whole load of us came here to celebrate after - Zac’s brother was the maitre’d at the time. It was a while ago; it was that case where Sherlock worked out that the chihuahua breeder bloke…the one from the Isle of Dogs that we were questioning about those dodgy goings on at the warehouse unit?…” Greg paused. He raised his eyebrows and gestured with his hand as if to say,
“Why do you need to hear it all?” he asked calmly, annoyingly, picking his newspaper up and turning to the next page, then folding it back again with a dismissive flick. “You won't be able to write any of it on the blog anyway.”
Sherlock's assailant looked at John, then, possibly picking up on something that John was thinking. There was still blood seeping from the man's nose and one of his eyes was darkening and swelling closed. It looked like Sherlock's elbow had caught him full in the face. He stared back at John with his one good eye. ”What're you lookin' at, short arse?” he said and then he called John a name that would have had John's mother rushing for the soap.
"I must say, John, you seem very worried. It's only a flesh wound - its not like it's anything vital. It's not like its my heart."
Just over five minutes later, Greg had come back to bed bearing his own coffee, his phone, and Mycroft’s tea on a round, red Christmas-themed tray. Mycroft moved back over to the empty side of the bed so Greg could get in. Greg set the tray carefully on top of his pile of magazines and shrugged off his dressing gown to hang it on the back of his door again. He was totally unfazed by being completely naked in the soft early morning light, which had now noticeably brightened, and as he came back to bed, he reached down and switched his bedside lamp on. The warm gentle glow once again transformed the room. Greg getting back into the bed to sit up beside Mycroft transformed it further. He twisted round to reach Mycroft’s mug from the tray and handed it to him. As Mycroft sat up to take it, he realised his heart was still doing a gymnastic display about last night, which he had been thinking about while Greg had been gone. ‘Will I ever stop thinking about it?’ he wondered, smiling, taking the mug gratefully. Which made him realise that it was not only his heart that was on double-time. His smile had never seen so much action either. Being with Gregory Lestrade was like having an almost non-stop facial exercise workout.
John frowned. Sherlock had said something about it too, he remembered. “But didn't you s—” he started, but Sherlock cut him off. He turned to John quickly and said, “What do you think about that cold case at RAF Mildenhall with Major Singh? Do we need to go back there to the training ground and talk to his secretary?” John had been really interested in this one as it involved military connections.
Lucia ignored this, flicked open the box awkwardly one-handed and then shook it demandingly under his nose again, at which point he finally grabbed a cracker and shoved the box crossly away from his face and in Mycroft's general direction. Mycroft grudgingly took one too, and Lucia quickly went round the table, offering the box to everyone in turn, still holding the salad bowl, as Siger went around the table the other way and finished dishing up the scallops as if in a choreographed food/cracker-serving dance routine. Once everyone (and every place) had a complete plate of first course and a cracker in front of them, Siger and Lucia discarded the serving plate and bowl on the sideboard - in case anyone wanted second helpings - and took their seats too.
he said fervently, gripping hard with his thigh. He fixed Mycroft with his dark, warm gaze. “Stop with me…Sleep the night with me.”
‘That’s Sherlock all over,’ thought John. He smiled at the thought.  ‘He's such a mass of contradictions...Life with him could never get boring, and don’t I just love knowing that?'
Mycroft made a short detour to the hook on back of Greg’s bedroom door and lifted them off; the one Greg had worn earlier to go downstairs and a second, older one which was simple thick white towelling.
John snorted a bit and lowered the precious card in his hands. “That’s—yeah—I know, but it’s just…it’s just what people do. Like, as if it’s from a romantic secret admirer…people write; ‘Be my valentine, from ?’ ”
When he had grasped Sherlock's shirt, one of his top buttons had surrendered and popped open. As he had taken Sherlock over to the wall, a second button near the top had followed the first, so Sherlock's shirt was hanging slightly open already. John looked at the pale skin, newly exposed at Sherlock's chest. The sight of it made his heart pound. Oh, yes, this was different; different from anything else John had ever done, but that didn't mean he didn't want to do it.
“Goose, John! I hope that’s ok with you?” said Lucia, who had come back to the table with a sponge in her hand to wipe the surface where she had been working. She stopped mid-wipe, appearing momentarily concerned. “Sherlock didn’t say you had any dietary requirements?” she added hopefully, looking suddenly like she had just realised she’d completely forgotten to ask.
Gabriella and Clarissa both stood on the doorstep and waved them goodbye as they set off down the path; laden with paintings, scones and - John, at least - full of good cheer. Given the sudden chill turn the evening had taken, John was really grateful for that break in the warm and having had something to eat and drink to tide them over for the journey home.
And he was getting an answer to those questions. The fierceness of their embrace was changing form as they stood there inside it; he could think things that he couldn't yet say, and he was struck afresh by the realisation that he
Lucia stopped for a moment and turned to face him. “No, no, John, you’re absolutely fine as you are! I just really want to get changed out of my cooking clothes. I smell of that bloody goose fat and I’m covered in gravy spots!”
Greg came up and kissed his mouth, his hands slowly moving round and down to the front of Mycroft’s belt. “Good,” he said softly. “Yer might get to hear it a bit more in a minute then…”
Mycroft - ruffled - stroked his hair back one-handed, holding the mug extra-tightly in his other hand. He quite looked like a shocked cat, grooming itself for comfort, Greg thought fondly.
“No, I put it in my desk at work to hide it from anyone seeing it…” said Greg. He shifted his position, and pointed his finger to pin down the facts. “…So, hang on, you just said you got a note from
"From his point of view, a paring knife was maybe not the best choice of murder weapon," commented John, wryly.
Sherlock leaned down and kissed him on his laughing mouth - simply because now he could do that. He could do all those things that he’d been thinking about for so long. “I’ve thought about us doing that so many times, John," he said softly, smiling broadly, enjoying John's amusement. It was simply the truth.
he called back in resignation. From the sound of Sherlock's voice, the letter would just have to wait. Sherlock sounded both pissed off and particularly demanding. John heard him coming up the stairs at a fairly urgent pace. As Sherlock opened the front door of the flat, John asked, "What's up?" without looking around.
thought Sherlock, remembering like a shock of cold water one of the first real deductions he had made about Mary.
The front and sides of the balcony were made of waist-level thick slats of wood, weathered silvery with age, and they not only let in light to form a striped pattern on the floor, but also offered a good measure of privacy. Just as well, thought Mycroft, as right now Greg was, in full view of anyone who happened to be looking, completely and very visibly nude - his modesty hidden only by the wooden slats. Greg opened the glass balcony door on the left a narrow gap, just about wide enough to reach through and retrieve his lighter from the stool, and once he had it, he stepped back inside the room but left the balcony door ajar.
New to all this amazing finery of a complicated three course meal made at home, John was deeply impressed. “Oh, wow!” he remarked, at both the striking look and sound of the dish and the concept of half of it being grown just outside the window.
The roads became more and more residential until they eventually turned down a quiet side street of elegant, terraced Victorian houses; all decorative red brickwork with high bay windows and bevelled sills of pale stone. There were large, mature London plane trees dotted periodically in gaps in the paving slabs on both sides of the street, their seed pods dangling like decorative baubles from the bare branches. Greg directed the driver of the taxi and he came to a smooth stop halfway down the street, outside number 29. A low brick wall separated the front garden from the pavement, and the wall was clearly the same vintage as the house; constructed of the same dusky red and aged bricks. There were skeletal tufts of small-leafed hardy plants growing in various cracks and fissures in the old mortar, and in clumps around its base.
in that coat, you great idiot,' and then he baulked at the errant thought that had come into his head. He froze, eyes a bit wide.
“So you’re back on the fags as well, then?” he said, as Mycroft finally brought the cigarette to his lips and inhaled as he stepped out onto the balcony too; sweeping his other hand through his hair again as he did so, the strong harsh taste of the cigarette at once vile and yet so familiar, the wonderful head rush of the nicotine nothing short of heavenly. He closed his eyes. “Apparently so…” Mycroft admitted. “Well, at least for today…”
John's phone started ringing then and he glanced at the screen. It was Lestrade. John tapped 'answer' with his thumb and pressed the phone to his ear automatically, but he was looking at Sherlock, who continued to look back at him with an unreadable expression.
Shinysherlock is very real and has an account on AO3. Thank you, thank you, Shinysherlock for the excellent prompt idea! Loved it. Just sorry it took me so long…! (I started it in December 2014, so six and more than a half - very nearly seven!!! - years; which may or may not be some sort of record for such a short piece of fan fiction?! You can let me know…!) 😬
why Sherlock didn’t want to repeat Alex Burson's words, you could say he had pushed Sherlock to it. Mainly in retaliation for the eyes in the cup at 6 a.m. So; true, fair enough, he had
"Oh! Hello! I'm Clarissa," supplied Clarissa, unnecessarily - though of course she was unaware of that fact - quickly pulling off her muddied gardening gloves to shake hands with each of them. She repeated their names back to them as she shook their hands, obviously using a memory technique to cement them in her mind, and she shook their hands in a pleasantly firm way. Her warm, confident manner spoke of someone who had had long practice in meeting people. And not that many women shook hands so firmly, John observed, feeling a bit Sherlock.
So this was another thing that they would never talk about, he thought, looking at the soft, rounded hollow in the fabric. He put the glass back on the bedside table thoughtfully and before he could tell himself not to, he shifted over and laid back down where Sherlock had lain, turning his face slightly into the pillow and breathing in Sherlock's heady, woody scent. He didn't let himself ask why he was doing it and his internal voice stayed wisely mute. He breathed in Sherlock's scent until he couldn't really smell it any more, and then he got up. The internal voice remained thankfully silent.
John just happened to be watching, and immediately as Sherlock spoke, Mycroft picked up a large rosemary sprig between finger and thumb and flicked it straight at Sherlock’s head, exactly like a dart. Or even a poison arrow. It bounced lightly off his temple and he made a yelp of laughing surprise. Before he could retaliate, Lucia banged her hand lightly on the table.
Greg was not nervous. “Oh, yer awake! Mornin’!” he said cheerfully with a warm grin. Not a trace of awkwardness either. He came into the room and leant his back against the doorframe.
she exclaimed excitedly about the chocs. She did a lot of exclaiming, as well as thigh slapping too, John had noticed. She finished her exaggerated stirring in the teapot and clapped the lid on, bringing it to the table. “I did! And I remembered your After Eights too, don’t worry…” then she flapped a hand at Mycroft. “Oh, do you remember - you loved those too, didn’t you Mycroft?” then she said “John!—” loudly and excitedly, making him look up - she’d clearly remembered a funny story, “—After Eights were always Siger and Mycroft’s favourites, and Mycroft had told little Sherlock he wasn’t allowed to eat them - he was only about two! He came in here one Christmas Eve all upset and when I asked him why, he said he’d wanted to try the special after dinner chocolates but Mycroft had told him you could only eat them after eight o’clock at night, and that was his bedtime - so Mycroft had been very firm that that meant he couldn’t have
Now, John Watson had absolutely nothing against swearing - on the contrary, he really liked a good swear. Always had done. It relieved tension, for one thing. It could sometimes be amusing. Different situations clearly called for different swear-words. He also sometimes rather liked to swear his appreciation quite enthusiastically during sex, which was naturally something that people would only know about John Watson if they’d been on particularly friendly terms with him, but hearing Sherlock say all those words… It had quite effectively done something to John that it had had no business at all doing.
John just smiled, shaking his head. He liked very much all the good-natured teasing and fun that went on in the Holmes’ family.
Mycroft looked at him and melted. “Yes,” he said, “I’d like to,” before he even knew he was going to say it.
Greg’s kitchen was pretty tiny and Mycroft was not. He was very big in the small room. Greg noticed. He couldn’t
Sherlock said nothing at all but the look in his eyes said everything. He took John's hand from where it gripped his thigh and brought it gently to the front of his pants. John pressed his hand down slowly, watching Sherlock's face, and it took every ounce of Sherlock's self-control not to push back up hard in response. The silent moment that passed between them then was charged and heavy with significance. “Now what?” Sherlock said quietly, breaking the silence, his voice rough-edged.
thought about his gun, but then, that night, he had dreamt that he was watching a play of Romeo and Juliet at the Globe Theatre, and he was the only person in the audience. It was the end of the play, and as Romeo drank the poison bent over Juliet’s pale, still form, John had whispered aloud, “I'm not going to be Romeo.”
Greg had swallowed his toast and could speak clearly again. “Oh, don’t worry, I won’t call you either of ‘em in public!” Greg sipped some tea and grinned at him over the top of the mug. “I just like nicknames…” he explained. “They’re fun.”
“Erm...can I…tell you what to do now?" John asked, in a slightly strangled voice. Sherlock shrugged and gestured expansively with open palms. “I don’t know,” he said mildly. “Why don’t you try me?’
"Passionate," he said suddenly, in a soft expressionless voice, making Agatha chuckle and Mycroft snort.
“Mycroft…” Greg said, “I’m really sorry…I feel a bit…erm….” He looked at Mycroft and pulled a face. “I need a cigarette,” he admitted. “I‘m tryin’ to stop but… I…
It was quite warm in Gregory’s kitchen and Mycroft had a lot of layers on. He also knew he didn’t look his best when he got too hot. He passed Greg his empty glass and then said, to explain, “I think if you’ll excuse me, I must take my suit jacket off too. It’s rather warm in here.”
Siger, for his part in the performance, held up a small metal keychain decorated with a dangling pink rubber love-heart and pointed at it with his other hand. John burst out laughing at his silly pretend-excited expression.
Greg lowered his arms, still grinning. “Ah, come on! For you? After last night?! Anything!” said Greg, playing along with the joke, and he walked over.
“Lucky indeed,” agreed Mycroft, his fingers stroking through Greg’s silver hair again, feeling extremely lucky in all sorts of ways.
"—89 and 91, I think. Apparently the parents were both keen sailors in their day, and they raced boats."
“There’s really no need,” said Mycroft, handing it over and knowing Greg was watching him as he looked down to straighten his cuffs. Then he looked up, caught Gregory’s eye and stroked his hair back lightly with one hand, appearing to be doing so in case the careful action of jacket removal had perhaps made it look mildly dishevelled. Of course it hadn’t; he was just preening himself for Greg and he knew it.
The man ahead of John zipped through a narrow gap between two pillars and disappeared from view. When John reached the pillars, he passed through the gap and stopped and swore. This section of the car park was full of cars, unlike the last, and there were numerous vehicles to hide behind or under. But John couldn't hear his the suspect's footsteps so he clearly wasn't running, he must have—but just as John started to turn, something clobbered him on the back of the head behind his left ear, and he saw stars, the world vaguely beginning to swim out of view. He retained enough sense to dive rather then crumple and rolled sideways onto his back, as he did so aiming a solid roundhouse kick at the lower leg of the person behind him, aiming for immediately below his knee. The other man screamed and then swore heartily in a foreign language and dropped the weapon he had used to whack John with, clutching at his knee and dropping to the floor in a similar dramatic fashion, shouting in heavily accented English that John had "broken his fucking leg." John's head was swimming a bit but he was very much still with it, and while he lay on the floor, he checked the back of his head carefully with his fingers, feeling for blood. There was none. His assailant's weapon rolled towards him, and John saw now that it was a strangely rounded and smooth piece of wood, shaped like a club. He suddenly realised what it was. The business end of sawn-in-half baseball bat. Lovely. Luckily for John, the bloke had only just caught him a glancing blow, as he had just begun to turn round to look behind him when his attacker had struck. John’s unhappy assailant was now sitting down on the concrete floor, writhing, wincing and swearing in pain, still mostly in his native tongue. "You've dislocated my fuckin’ knee," he wailed, the words thick with his accent and the pain.
Mycroft decided to take the plunge. “Do you know, I’m rather intrigued to know what you liked about me at the party,” he said suddenly, remembering. “You didn’t quite get around to telling me…” He felt a little embarrassed that he was digging for compliments, but at the same time he found himself desperately wanting to find out.
As Mycroft took his coat off, he tried not to deduce but some things were impossible not to see. There were an assortment of other items of clothing on the coat rack, including an elderly and battered waxed Barbour jacket, which looked incredibly comfortable. Surely too big for Greg and very well worn, so must have belonged to a relation….vintage from the age of it, but not ancient, so…
Sherlock looked around awkwardly at John over his left shoulder. John noted the wince as he moved. "What do you mean,
Agatha had become a close friend of the Holmeses by long acquaintance, as they and their next-door neighbour had been living in the same two houses for the last forty years. “—So we’re all like a little extended family,” Siger chipped in, helping himself to another mince pie. John just caught Mycroft's face recoil in a moue of distaste at the description before he recovered his composure.
… Carefully, almost reverentially, Greg finished gently opening his belt, popped the fly button and slowly unzipped his trousers. He slid them down over Mycroft’s hips slightly with the backs of his fingers, caressing the curved bones of his pelvis lightly with both palms as he did it. “Oh
since he had held another man’s hand…let alone kissed him wildly and repeatedly against his kitchen sink and then followed him upstairs to his bedroom…well, he considered truthfully, the sink moment had been a first, in fact…but
"Why didn't you realise he was armed?" blurted John, suddenly, realising that Sherlock would have known in a moment whether someone was armed or not.
‘It’s better than that,’ thought Mycroft gently, looking only at Greg. In the gleam of the moonlight streaming in through the window, he considered the idea that Greg looked like some kind of dramatic Pre-Raphaelite fallen angel from a Millais painting…and the amazing thing about that being that if he was, he was Mycroft’s fallen angel - for tonight at least, but right now, that was all that mattered.
Sherlock was out, and there was no indication of where he had gone and when he would be back. So John made some breakfast for himself and sat at the table with it, flicking through one of the newspapers while he ate. 'All back to normal again, then,' he thought suddenly. He didn't know if he was relieved or saddened by that.
Mycroft liked the smooth and unshowy way that Greg had dealt with that situation. He liked it very much. Which was a bit of an understatement, rather. The truth was he was actually astonished to discover how it made him feel. He stroked his thumb over one of Greg’s knuckles. “I believe you had been just about to tell me more about the black label Iberian ham that you sampled on your holiday…?” he said placidly, his stomach swirling in an interesting way.
And why the fuck were they sending notes like this to Sherlock, because this sure as hell hadn’t come out of the pile of standard typed-up police reports.
And suddenly John felt like the time he had been hit in the chest by a piece of shrapnel in Helmand in Afghanistan, and he thanked God for the body armour which had saved him, but the force of the blast had still knocked him clean off his feet. This time though, it was like the ghost of the shrapnel hitting him, so it left only an emotional shockwave behind it in his chest, rather than a physical one, but it still practically knocked him clean off his feet.
"Mmm. Most doctors are not so good with the hands-on aspect," commented Sherlock as John worked a particularly tight area loose.
"Sit down, sit down," instructed Gabriella, pulling off and discarding the artist's smock and her battered jacket untidily onto the back of a faded dark red leather armchair. She went through a doorway to a small kitchen. Sherlock sat down on the armchair and John chose one side of an equally aged but mismatched sofa next to twin bookcases.
A John who stood looking so utterly wretched that Sherlock felt his face do something he didn't remember it ever really doing before. "What John, what? Is it Mary? Is it the baby?” he asked desperately.
He took the remaining two steps over and stood in front of Greg, taking his hand and feeling as awkward as he had when his usual tailor hadn’t been there once, and he had had to deal with the new fellow.
“Offer these round when Aggie and your father come back,” she instructed Sherlock as he grudgingly took the plate. “Your father will forget all about them and I’ve got to get Mycroft. He’s apparently
As Sherlock got close enough, John saw that he also had the encouragement of a small handgun pressed to the small of the man's back. John already happened to know that it was a very realistically cold and solid, but also very fake gun that Sherlock had picked up from somewhere. John shook his head, once, carefully, thinking that rather ironically, even though Sherlock was not only impersonating a police officer (illegal), and detective inspector, no less, with stolen police ID (very illegal), he was also brandishing a very realistic firearm in public (also pretty flipping illegal). Rather than being a law breaker, though - despite breaking three of them at once - he was, in fact, on the side of the good guys. John almost began to break into a rueful grin at the thought but then he caught a fleeting expression cross Sherlock's face and realised that Sherlock was hurt and that he was hiding it. The suspect he had gone after was older and looked far tougher and streetwise than the one who John had gone after.
He put his own glass down on the worktop too. This situation needed his full attention, that was certain. He swallowed. “Oh, I’m sure,” he murmured, quietly slightly terrified now the moment seemed to have arrived.
Sherlock shook his head once in an infinitesimally tiny movement so that the man he was holding in front of him would not notice it - so;
He obeyed immediately, his cheeks and ears pinking more than they were already, coming up on both palms above Greg to make space, as Greg tipped the bottle generously onto his own lower stomach and top of his pubic hair. “Now come back down,” Greg said throatily, as he recapped the bottle briskly with a single careless twist of the cap and set it back without looking above his head on the bedside table. His hands, both now oily and empty, simultaneously slid down Mycroft’s sides to his hips and then his arse as Mycroft lowered himself back down to lie on Greg and they each pressed their bodies firmly together. “Mmmmm,” said Greg and then, “Oooh, your
"Er, yeah," replied John, "I've seen his work before. He does a lot of birds, and snow. People sitting looking out of windows. And he's a writer as well."
John was just then sifting quickly through various bills, their old tenancy agreement and a hand-drawn floor-plan of the Old Bailey - which made him raise his eyebrows before he discarded it - so it was a moment before he answered. “Not when I’m trying to watch a bloody film, I don’t,” he replied, “I wish you’d just let me work it all out for myself.”  He gave up looking in that drawer abruptly, slamming it shut to start on the next.
He scrambled back up the decadently-trashed bed to kiss Greg, draping his body over Greg’s again, one knee bent up to support his weight and up high on his forearms, so that Greg could breathe. From this perfect vantage point, he bent his head lightly kissed him hello.
It was like suddenly being bestowed with a super-human power. For a few seconds, neither one of them moved or spoke.
want to know for the blog, but I wanted to get you back and I thought I’d do it by making you have to say something you didn’t want to,” John replied helplessly.
pissed-off-John-ness. Sherlock was lying down again, but he rolled over onto his side to face John and came up on one elbow to look at what ‘this’ might be.
The night outside was crisp and clear, and as Greg flung the curtain back, moonlight suddenly flooded in; a bright beam of it leapt across the bedroom, catching Greg in the centre of it - struggling to do up Mycroft’s expensive waistcoat on a cheap, plastic hanger.
Greg watched him for a moment, admiring the elegant way he held the fag between his long fingers and drew in the smoke, turning his face away from Greg to blow it out.  He made it look like an art form.
Next to him and very quietly, Sherlock leaned closer and muttered sarcastically in his ear, “Lucky you!” which made John smile.
"It's one of my favourite poems, Sherlock," he said slowly. "In fact, I think it is my favourite. I read it a lot while I was away….I grew up near the sea and it…it reminded me so acutely of home.”
"Er, thank you," John replied, embarrassed. John felt like a slightly naughty child that had been caught in the act, but Gabriella and Clarissa were much too distracted by Sherlock's words to notice John and his scone indiscretion.
Everyone at the table watched the contents of Agatha's palm with interest to see what the fish would do. After a few seconds, the sides of the fish began to curl gently. "Fickle!" proclaimed John, smiling.
John was annoyed that Sherlock had been so insistent that he didn't need John for this one, as he had said he was only going to scout the place out and not put himself at risk, but then he had come back looking like a Christmas turkey. "That's why you need back-up if you're going to risk being carved up like a—” he started, but he stopped himself. John was angry, but he also realised that talk wasn't getting this wound sorted out, and anyway, anger wasn't conducive to good health care. Or a good repair, in this case. He took a deep breath and expelled some air out forcefully through his nose. "Oh, let me get my kit," he said. He went and got his kit and some gloves.
When they asked for the bill, Mycroft said quickly, “Let me get this, you get the next one,” and Greg didn’t argue with him. “Ok, sure, if you want…thanks,” was all he said. Which only delighted Mycroft further; the complicit agreement that there would
In Mycroft’s neatly ordered world, this glorious, hedonistic abandonment to such a primeval activity simply wasn’t done.
Mycroft had nearly finished his slice of toast and he put it down on his plate and rose to the challenge at once. “Gregory?” he said, really softly, sliding the back of his hand under his chin. He sat up straight and looked down his nose a little, quite deliberately.
yer to!” he blurted out cheerfully, making Mycroft smile again. Honesty, flirtation, swearing and now all this wild, reckless abandon. He was in
Mycroft shoved the covers down to give himself a bit of space and Greg threw his head back on the pillows as Mycroft went to work. “Oh!” Greg said.
For Sherlock though, it was slow, it made a lot of noise, the seats were upholstered in cheap, rough, velveteen fabric that had seen much better days...
The driver stopped the engine and turned the internal lights on, and as he announced the charge, Greg dropped Mycroft’s hand quickly to delve into his pocket for his wallet. He leant forward to pay the driver. “Thanks, mate! Keep the change!” Greg said to him cheerfully, handing him a note and then sliding across and opening his door as soon as the cabbie had released the door lock.
Seeing as he didn't have anything more smart to wear, he just went and appraised himself in the upstairs bathroom mirror. He wished Sherlock had said to bring something smart for the evening, even though they were only staying in. He re-tucked his favourite tattersall checked shirt that he was already wearing, and pulled it flat so it sat nicely. It still looked fairly neat. Not
With that sentence, Greg’s flirting element fully ignited again. “Mmm, well,” he said casually, pretending to think about it carefully first, “I should think you could call me whatever you want…! As long as you say
Agatha had now conquered the cellophane envelope but been confounded by the tiny writing on the little slip of paper that came with it, and she turned to pass them both to John. "Can't read it without me glasses," she said. "What are you supposed to do?"
them anymore with that desperate clawing need. And there was a vast difference between the want and the need.
“Whatever you like,” said Greg, amiably. “Feels quite nice to stand up after bein' sat down all night.” They smiled at each other and both took a sip of their whisky. It was obvious that Greg had suggested they move to the sitting room for the sake of the comfortable seats, but really, neither of them actually wanted to. Not only because, as Greg had said, they had been seated all evening, but also because standing here was good; it was good physically, true, but being near each other like this, admiring each other in the close confines of this small room was…even more so. Mycroft had noted without meaning to when he passed the sitting room, that Greg’s armchairs were rather far apart, and the tiny two-seater sofa that he had in there had looked much too much of a squeeze for both of them to relax on. Especially with the full laundry basket that was currently on it. In Greg’s small and cosy kitchen however, Mycroft could feel the energy and chemistry between them like the push of heat and the drift of sparks close to a bonfire. From the deep look in Gregory’s beautiful brown eyes, he knew he could feel it too.
“That won’t be strong enough for that big pot, darling, put some more in,” she said to him briskly, as an aside, and then to Siger, she said, “Sigs, darling, do you think you could chop this up?” She flicked the water off the parsley into the sink and reached up to a shelf in the wooden beam above her head for a big double-handled herb chopper. Mycroft absently handed her a tea towel from a rail next to him and she wiped the chopper blade briefly before then handing that to Siger as he came over to the sink to wash his hands. Neither she, nor anyone else present, paid any attention at all to Sherlock’s request for a murder; making John smile to himself at the gloriously oiled workings of the Holmes family mechanics. How nothing like his own they were, he thought…and thank God for that.
Sherlock swept his hair back with both hands. “I just said I was going to tell you about it today,” he repeated, to clarify. He pointed a finger at the note in John’s hand. “That one was the first one I wrote. A...er...practice run, if you like. It turns out I’m not so good with Greg’s handwriting as I am with Mycroft’s. So, yes,
Siger laughed, but Lucia said in his defence, “It hasn’t had any splinters for years, though, has it?” she pointed her peeler at him. “Trust you to remember that!”
"I am lucky," Sherlock replied, suddenly. "I am very lucky to have you," he added, suddenly serious, his gaze still directed straight ahead.
She was a tall striking woman of around Gabriella's age or slightly younger; slim, with skin the colour of pale bronze, her long black hair in a loose side ponytail elegantly shot through with silver streaks. She froze in the doorway, slightly surprised, her eyes widening, and as John and Sherlock both stood up immediately to greet her, Gabriella called through quickly from the kitchen. "These are our guests, darling," she announced loudly, coming through into the doorway with a huge bright red teapot in her hand, still swilling it round with hot water to warm it. She indicated them separately with her one free hand as she said their names. "This is Sherlock...and this is John."
moaned Greg, laughing, loving it.  “I suspected it last night but if you're gonna keep sayin’ it like that, I really don't stand a chance…Let me just finish my toast a minute—” he waved what was left, “—and I
he snorted, in exasperation, snatching it up. Then he said, a bit crossly, “I can’t bloody see what I’m doin’ ‘ere!” and with the waistcoat in one hand and the hanger in the other, he and reached across to yank open one of the curtains.
He was right though, they didn't talk about it. Sherlock didn't mention it when he came home and neither did John. It was as if it had never happened.
he growled meaningfully, looking John straight in the eye. He said it very slowly and he used every bit of his face to say it.
“Why couldn’t you use one of your glass things?” John barked back, outraged. “You've got enough bloody chemistry sets to—”
Earlier in the week, Sherlock had been bored and at John's suggestion, he had gone in desperation to Lestrade, to ask for some cold cases to occupy him.  Sherlock had been going up in the lift on the way to Lestrade’s office, and the lift doors had opened and in had got Anderson. Sherlock had looked him up and down and noticed things but said nothing. Anderson glared back at him, red-faced, bristling and waiting for Sherlock to speak, but Sherlock didn't bite. In the end he raised his eyebrow and said coldly, "Something wrong, Anderson?"
All the same, he still hadn't really actually expected a literal, word-for-word regurgitation quite like
Agatha had filled the kettle, switched it on and was noisily selecting mugs. “Who wants tea?” she asked the room in general. All those in favour said aye, and as she gathered mugs and then milk from the fridge she remarked, “Siggy-darling, what are you looking at on your phone? Not golf again?”
- the large splash of it now adorning the seat of Mycroft’s immaculate charcoal grey trousers. The whisky on the worktop had meanwhile formed a little stream and now began to run joyfully towards the edge, and Greg looked frantically around for the nearest tea towel or a sponge before it got there and did any further damage.
on it in large blue letters. “I like to cook with wine…” Siger said mysteriously, but with such a grin that John could tell there was a punchline coming. “Go over and see that postcard from Sicily, John…” he directed, nodding his head at it again. John smiled and dutifully went over. The postcard from Sicily was being held onto the fridge by a large fridge magnet of a vintage illustration. It showed a stylised drawing of a smiling 1950’s housewife wearing a striped apron and brandishing a wooden spoon. The caption on the fridge magnet read, 'I like to cook with wine…sometimes I even put it in the food…' John snorted laughter and turned to Siger, who, at the very moment John turned to him to acknowledge his joke, raised his glass in a jaunty salute. “Cheers!” he said brightly and took another big swig, making John laugh.
Mycroft was surprised into an honest answer. “I...thank you, I am. Very well. I trust you...are...well, too?"
had simply come from nowhere too. Greg released him for a moment. He drew back so he could see Mycroft’s face and paused, smiling delightedly and looking at Mycroft with something like wonder. He slid his hand that was currently in Mycroft’s hair back down the side of his neck and down to the top of his shoulder, turning his palm so the side of his thumb rested on the level of Mycroft’s collarbone through his shirt. He stroked it familiarly back and forth through the fabric.
“Er, yeah,” he said remembering it. There had been something off about what the Major had told them. “Maybe that would be worth a look?” John continued. “What if he—” but then Lucia interrupted. She came and stood in the sitting room doorway and said, “We’re just about ready, everyone, would you like to sit down and we’ll bring dinner though?” She looked pointedly at Sherlock. “Get Mycroft off his bloody phone, darling,” she said. “Make him sit down.” That was some task, John thought.
John saw his cue, which was to ask what the throw-away comment had been, and he took his opportunity to reach for the scone while covering his action with the question. "Which was?" he asked quickly, taking the scone with one hand while he reached for the butter with his knife.
Now onto Gabriella. He turned slightly to look at her. “I knew you were left-handed because of the finger prints on the side of the canvas, and the prints were not paint after all, as I’d first thought, they were mud, but estuary mud, it has a very beige grey look, and a silty, silky feel to it and it was very fresh. There were lots of right hand finger prints and thumb prints on the edges and on the back, all on the right of the canvas where it had been held it with the right hand, so, showing that the artist was left-handed and the small size of the prints showed this was either a woman or a very small man.The indentation marks on the canvas were from a carrying frame, and there were plenty, so the painting had been in and out of the carrying frame, which suggested the artist was local to the scene depicted and had often walked to the spot to paint it from life. Lots of the paintings were coastal, or seascapes, some of the same scene but from different viewpoints.”
Downstairs, Greg directed Mycroft to (and left him in charge of) what he referred to as his "amazing coffee machine” and the container of different flavoured coffee-pod selections. Then he quickly shrugged on some appropriate outdoor clothes and a coat, and was gone out the door.
John knew better than to make any mention of it though. Mycroft was standing at the sink when they entered the room, swirling some hot water around in the teapot to warm it first.
"He does it all the time," said John, grinning warmly and enjoying both her reaction and Sherlock's incredible ability. And which had just explained her use of the army slang word ‘scoff’, he thought.
Sherlock looked back out of the window. John watched him and now it wasn't just to check his face for sweating, or increased pallor or shortness of breath. 'The reason I'm so very angry about it is because I really care about you,' John thought suddenly. And then he thought, 'But isn't that just being a good doctor or a good soldier though - obviously - to care about people, your patients, your comrades?'
Greg sat up a bit and held out one hand to Mycroft. “Come over ‘ere…” he said, inclining his head over to the bed behind him, his voice soft, rumbling and enticing.
John shook his head. "Nothing to do with not having a case on at the moment, then?” He smiled into his cup.
a real person and he wrote a song called "This is the Picture (Excellent Birds)" which you can find on You-tube. This is where I got some of the ideas for the art and writing that Gabriel(la) Peters created. John’s favourite poem and the lines of poetry Sherlock quotes (about the mudflats at dawn) is all my own work. You won’t find that on google, I’m afraid! …Not yet, anyway…🤪
Mycroft burst out laughing. He actually had to put his drink down before he spilt it. He thought he’d never laughed so much in one night in his entire life and certainly never while feeling so aroused at the same time. “Gregory, you’re so…
Now it was Sherlock’s turn to snort with disdain. “The same sort of people who call their children names like Mycroft and Sherlock,” he answered.
John simply couldn't speak anymore, his need to weep and let it out was greater than his need to speak and explain, and as he cried almost silently like a child into Sherlock's stomach, he realised that he just could not stop this dreadful weeping from happening and he didn't exactly know why it was so very, very painful. He only knew he had to get this out, and let it go; it felt like a poison deep in his system. He also realised that, conversely, he could not physically let go of his friend. Yes, of course he was very angry about Mary's betrayal and the terrible extent of her lies - so angry, and humiliated...but he felt very aware that there was more to it than that. That there was an older, stronger and much more painful anger and loss underneath it. And then something turned in his mind and opened up to him, and he realised suddenly that what he was weeping for was the loss of
“Something up?” asked Mycroft cautiously, who knew the usual reason for late night phone calls and texts was rarely good tidings.
Sherlock couldn't even begin to try to say to John what he had just worked out. "Nothing. Nothing, it doesn't matter."
…shocking, yes, and it had certainly shocked John, but more than just shocking; to John’s ears it had been something else. It had all sounded…somehow so…deliciously…
“Funny, isn’t it,” said John thoughtfully, looking down at her elegant artistic writing, wondering why she had underlined that one word. “Fancy calling your twin children such similar names…I mean, ‘Gabriel and Garbriella.’ So eccentric. Can you imagine calling them for dinner? Must have been confusing.” But he wasn’t really thinking about their names, it was the first two lines of her message that had really set him thinking the most.
“Well. I think we both know why we are here,” Mycroft said steadily, thinking of what Greg had written.
Agatha turned to include John in the conversation again. “So you’re all down from London!” she said, reaching for her nearly full sherry glass behind her on the table. He had just started to tell her yes, that was right, when there came the clear (and somewhat embarrassing) sound of lowered voices having a minor disagreement from the sitting room and Siger instinctively raised his own voice to cover it. “Sherry, John?” he asked over-loudly, gesturing with the open bottle and an empty glass. “It’s got a lovely bouquet! Have a sniff!”
…clouding his thought processes; auditory was bad enough, but now visual… and it wouldn't go away. Every time he waved it away, it kept coming back.
said Greg, thrilled at the candid admission, and noticing the body language. “Should I let you get a closer look just to make sure?” he grinned again to show he was still teasing.  He put his glass down on the worktop next to him and crossed the kitchen in three short steps, watching Mycroft as he came, the grin still on his face. He stopped in front of Mycroft, who straightened up automatically, uncrossing the supposedly relaxed ankles and standing at his full height,  both feet nervously together. He didn’t quite know what Gregory was going to do - well, he thought he
"Did you get any blood on your Belstaff?" John asked, looking over at the coat draped across the armchair.
John thought, incredulous with the sudden fierce knowledge, just as Sherlock's hand moved cautiously down his back and his other hand moved up to the back of John's head, and slid softly into his hair. Sherlock did it in a way which, for all intents and purposes, was more like a caress than an embrace.
he continued fiercely, pointing at Sherlock, “You’re like a machine - you never feel anything about anything! All you do is…deduce stuff about people!" John was well aware he sounded like a total idiot, but he was embarrassed, and he was angry at being made to feel that way.
Sherlock opened the microwave door cautiously and a puff of acrid white smoke belched delicately out. They both jerked backwards automatically. Then John launched himself at the kitchen window to open it, releasing a string of expletives as he did so, most of them aimed in Sherlock’s general direction, concerning the general inappropriateness of the hour to be conducting such experiments, the unpleasant fragrance, the reasoning, validity and, indeed, the necessity of conducting such experiments anyway and querying the real need for them to be performed in their kitchen at all. When he turned around from opening the window and saw exactly what Sherlock was retrieving gingerly from the microwave  - at arm’s length with the aid of the oven glove - he hit the roof.
thought John, delighted, and he grinned back. He should have realised by now that sex with Sherlock was always going to be so much more than simply a physical act. He didn't think he’d ever had this intimate mental connection before, because - of course - how could he have done? There was only one Sherlock Holmes. And apparently, he was all John’s.
Lovely! Thank you so much, John!” Mr. Holmes cried heartily, then he demanded, “Now, why are we still on the doorstep? Come in, come in!" He stepped aside for John to pass him and gestured invitingly into the house with an open arm. "Nice Christmas?" he asked, as John stepped over the threshold.
“Yeah. Of course," he murmured, not quite to her, not quite to himself. Sherlock noticed this with a sideways flick of his eyes but didn't comment.
Agatha looked over at John. “I’m next to you, John!” she announced in great delight, gesturing at him excitedly with her nearly-empty glass. She then finished the G&T in one last big gulp and banged her glass down firmly on the side table beside her.
He didn’t want to be the parent here. “I’d really like there to be no secrets between us…” he said carefully, as he folded the list over again and then tucked it into his wallet on top of his Tesco clubcard. “…But if you've got some cigarettes under there, I’d really rather know about them than not.” He closed his wallet and put it back in his inside pocket, and only then did he look up at Sherlock’s face.
When they discovered the bomb on the underground train and Sherlock had said he couldn't defuse it, John had thought at that moment that they were truly going to die down there. That this time, Death had
love chrysanthemums, John, thank you so much. I'll go and put these in water.” As she went, she flicked a glance at Siger who was busy looking at something on his phone, and said pointedly, “Tea, darling?” and Siger immediately shoved his phone in his pocket and set to work making a fresh pot for John.
Sherlock knew there was something John was hiding under something here and he was trying to find it. "Why?" he persisted calmly.
“Oh, well, ok then,” said John, slightly relieved. Those cats sounded pretty vicious actually, and anyway, with the exception of his new friend, Persephone, he was more of a dog person. “I’ll get the milk,” he said, and he did so.
John grinned at him, the soppy great sod. “Oh yeah, I’ve noticed…” he said, nodding slowly, and he ran his tongue lightly across his bottom lip.
Sherlock! They’ll never have just ‘got in’ on the off-chance to a place like that the night before Valentines’ Day! They’ll have been turned away unless they had a booking. Even Mycroft couldn’t possibly—” he gasped a bit in horror as he thought of it. “Mycroft’ll be mortified if he was—”
Siger came out of the pantry then with the ground almonds and awkwardly clutching some other packages of dried fruit and nuts - along with his phone, which he was looking at again. “Temperature’s dropping!” he said cheerfully, now glancing over to peer out of the window and check the slightly leaden sky as he brought the packages over to the table. As John and Sherlock turned and left the room, John heard Lucia say crossly to Siger, “Do put your phone away, darling! I need your
How many ways can I say this? I just want to hear his explanation in his own words - so I can write about his reasoning behind why he did what he did in a more interesting way! I’m really stuck here—” and he gestured towards the patiently flashing cursor waiting on his screen, “—it sounds so boring at the moment - he must have said
Sherlock sat forward in his chair and put his now empty cup on the coffee table. “The gallery owner told me that Gabriel was very angry about the positioning of the paintings and had slammed the phone down after shouting that he ‘wouldn't be blackmailed’, but what interested me was the throw away comment that she said he made afterwards," he said.
"How long for?” John demanded irrationally, but suddenly wanting to know and unable to tear his eyes away from Sherlock’s till he answered.
He was better at reading Sherlock now, he was better than anyone else on Earth - but he had never seen the look on Sherlock's face that he saw on it then.
John could see this was leading somewhere so he played along. "Oh yeah? What?" he said, beginning to grin himself.
Again, John appreciated the swiftly changing light at this time of year and at this time of day. It had changed slightly even as they started walking back and deepened somehow as the sun had started the last bit of its descent, and so the light was now of the purest golden quality, with the beginnings of almost a soft, peach-pink glow on the clouds low down in the sky.
Sherlock shook his head and grinned back at him. “John, you are truly full of marvels,” he said sincerely, making John feel all warm inside.
“Erm,” said John, not much of a sherry drinker, “er…no, thank you, I’d actually prefer another cup of—” and then Mycroft appeared abruptly in the doorway, in almost an echo of Sherlock’s sudden appearance a few moments before, but rather more looking as though he had been shepherded towards it and then forcibly pushed through it.
“Yeah! I just popped over there yesterday morning after I’d been to Tesco’s. When you were putting the shopping away. I had to go back again today because he had to order the strings in for me for this morning from their other shop…” he pointed at the fabric ball of rosin. “And I got the dark rosin rather than the light one because Oliver said you’d bought that one last time, and you’d previously bought it more than once, but it was a couple of months ago….And I liked the colour of the fabric wrap as well, so—” then he shut up and waited for Sherlock to unwrap it and smell it, as John knew he would; he clearly loved the smell of the rosins he used because John often caught him sniffing them before he used them.
—I can’t believe I can stop fantasisin’ about your legs now…” he gasped out the words brokenly, stroking up and down the underside of Mycroft’s thigh and then digging his fingers in, still moving his body in slow, tantalising thrusts. He began to move faster, rolling his hips harder against Mycroft’s, bringing another of those deliciously hot sounds emanating from his lover’s lips before Mycroft caught up and said breathily,
Greg and Mycroft were not in the least bit uncomfortable with the present situation, but the occupants of the other table certainly were. After a few more slowly passing moments, Greg inclined his body slightly towards the other man and called over softly, “ ‘Scuse me, mate?” He sounded fairly friendly and he didn’t raise his voice. His tone sounded for all the world like he might be about to ask the chap if he had the time, by any chance?
and he quickly started again, fixing John with his magnetic gaze to hold him there. "John, I've never felt…like I do about you, about anyone…ever…before. I've known how I feel about you…for a long time."
” and then he shook his head, laughing and still grinning, had added, "Sometimes you do really shock me, Sherlock!" but Sherlock saw that he was shocked and amused and not shocked and angry.
used to steal cheese and biscuits!” Without saying a word, Sherlock left the room at that point and went to dig about in the pantry - just to get away, John suspected. Meanwhile, Agatha was continuing her story. “Once, he had crept into the room when no one was looking, and just this little hand reached up over the edge of the table and grabbed a tiny handful of Stilton from the cheeseboard! He was only about three!”
Sherlock stood still. "I'm not sitting in A&E for six hours to be seen by a teenager fresh out of medical school. I'm not going."
“Well, I thought you’d appreciate some nice scoff after you’d been painting outside in the cold all day,” Clarissa replied.
Lucia was just coming back through from the kitchen with a huge wooden bowl of salad and a lightly steaming jug of something when she suddenly froze with a start and said, “Ooh! Ooh,
He said the last few words with such exuberant delighted, joyful enthusiasm that Mycroft laughed. He actually
Mischievously, Greg hooked his fingers into Mycroft’s belt loops at the side and drew him quickly forwards, while at the same time stepping backwards to sit down on the edge of his bed. He spread his knees as he went down, so that Mycroft could step in and stand just between his open thighs. As Greg sat down on the bed, he released the belt loops and slid his hands comfortingly down the sides of Mycroft’s thighs. So, he was now seated, directly in front of Mycroft, his face now much nearer to a significant part of Mycroft’s body. There was a poignant pause. Certain actions now seemed almost inevitable. Mycroft bit his lip nervously. “You…um…you don’t have to—” he started, but Greg interrupted him.
Greg was watching Mycroft’s angry face soften slowly as he thought things through, and as it did so, just at the right moment, his hands slid up to Mycroft’s long neck and on up to cup his face. Greg leaned in again and lightly kissed Mycroft on his lovely grumpy mouth. “Come on, MI6,” he said darkly. “I’m freezin’ my bollocks off, ere! Let me make that coffee and then we can go back to bed!”
John almost shouted it, furious again now because Sherlock wasn’t listening and wasn’t getting it. "Because of
thought Mycroft suddenly, in a fresh wave of amazement and wonder, again catching sight of the ghost of the shy and self-conscious teenager that he had once been. He laid in the bed watching Greg as he pulled the curtains aside, properly revealing the small Juliette balcony that Mycroft had merely glimpsed last night. Now he saw that there was just about room on the tiny balcony for a couple of folding garden chairs, and that it had a small wooden stool acting as a table between them - on which stood an open beer can and a cheap red plastic lighter. Mycroft smiled. For someone who was supposed to be giving up smoking,
he thought, echoing her words, still looking awkwardly at Sherlock, and like a mental door softly closing, he simply stopped feeling embarrassed and awkward.
Mycroft, in his heated up state, could truly not tell if Greg meant to tease him or if he was still unsure whether it was permissible to use the word that he been using so freely for the last hour in this blunt way.
Sherlock made his own face blank and stared back at him and then John tipped his head sideways, rolled his eyes and blew a bit of air out through his mouth, as if to say,
…it was pretty elementary stuff, really," said John. "I think he had some James Bond aspirations,” he added, and then he realised and started to smile. He pointed at Sherlock accusingly with an amused look on his face. “And
And, well, but that certainly had the desired effect: John watched as Sherlock's eyes widened a little briefly in surprise before he closed them abruptly and swallowed, suddenly speechless at the thought of it.
- the wanker!!!" He pulled a face, contrite. “Ah, err, sorry! But…I don’t think I can thank him enough for doing what he did. I would
thought Greg, watching Mycroft crack the caramel surface delicately, and his long, pale fingers on the silver spoon as he removed individual shards of caramel and thin slivers of creme brûlée from the dish, one at a time.
His thick and darkly tousled curls, his luminous eyes, his pale smoothly muscled body and lean stomach with the light drift of hair which led John's eye down to the waistband of his expensive trousers, now quite badly creased, and - more importantly - underneath them, his obvious and very full erection. ‘I'll deal with
But Agatha wanted none of that. She waved a finger at Sherlock and gulped some more sherry. “Now, Sherlock, let’s not go there, or I’ll mention the cheese!”
How to accept or refuse the invitation, he wondered. There was no way to do so. The sender - and from the note’s contents, he now knew
So John would do what it took to protect Sherlock. And Sherlock knew he would do so again, if necessary. And that was important.
He had refused to allow himself to think it, but he had always hoped against the ridiculous hope that it
fantasising?” he said, and then he thought desperately, ’Please don’t stop!’ His mind didn’t seem to be working properly. He squeezed Greg with both his thighs.
John felt a wave of hot, astonished delight wash over him. So, ok, then; apparently he had the secret ability to make Sherlock Holmes
“Knowledge is always power with you two, eh?” said John, shaking his head and smiling, once again seeing the whole Holmes-brothers power play laid bare before him. Casually - but having a pretty good idea of the answer - John leaned back against the doorframe and asked, “So why didn’t you tell me what you were up to?”
“Hang on,” instructed Greg, “I just need to reach my...” he twisted, half turning, half hanging off the bed, and stretched up under Mycroft to reach the knob on the drawer of his bedside table. He yanked it open and rummaged sightlessly (but effectively) around in his upside down position. “It’s in ‘ere somewhere,” he added, feeling about for whatever it was, making Mycroft smile at his contortionism. Mycroft also had the most temptingly glorious view of his neck; tendons and muscles taut with the strain of his awkward position, and so rather than helping his lover in finding what it was he was looking for, Mycroft helped himself to Greg’s lovely brown skin instead. He lowered his head and touched his tongue lightly to Greg’s neck, working his way up and nipping gently with his teeth. Greg snorted. “Yeah, make it more difficult, why don’t yer?” he said, amused, and then he suddenly located the item he was looking for. “Ah-ha!” he exclaimed in delight, as his fingers landed on something in the depths of the drawer, and Mycroft looked up to see what he had. Greg was clutching a small, blue glass bottle. It didn’t have a label on it, but Mycroft recognised the very distinctive Neal’s Yard shape of the bottle. “Unscented almond oil,” explained Greg. “I don’t have any…erm…
again for? No, let me tell you about this amazing secluded beach I found by mistake one day instead...” and then he proceeded to relay an anecdote so full of humorous descriptions and the scenery and smells and sights of the island of Majorca, and so well away from the beaten tourist track, that Mycroft longed to go there more than he ever thought he would believe possible. “It sounds very beautiful,” he said, genuinely enchanted.
, Mycroft surmised. But why did Greg have it? Perhaps a question for another day, then, he thought. Mycroft hung his coat next to it, and as he did so, Gregory called out suddenly from the kitchen,“Highland Park, Laphroaig or Glenfarclas?”
“Oh, yeah, I’ll have some, please, Sherlock,” said John, holding up his water glass to make pouring from the full jug easier, and Sherlock obliged, saying nothing more. Agatha was holding her newly-replenished wineglass in one hand as he gestured at her with the jug a moment later, just about to drink from it, and though she didn’t stop telling them both about the bowler’s beautiful leg cutter, she covered the top of her water glass with her free hand quickly and dramatically so Sherlock couldn’t fill it, like people usually did when they were refusing more wine, and making a quick noise of scorn as she did so. “No,
Greg turned his beaming smile full on Mycroft. “Well,” he said, still with that teasing tone, “why didn’t you just say
And then, at other times, John's steadying presence was like the weight of a great cast-iron anchor, gently holding Sherlock down and keeping him right, holding his mind fast when it was beginning to flail off onto one of his whirlwind black journeys, spiralling out lost into the dark stratosphere.
She laughed and actually slapped her knee. “Oh, that wily old bugger, Leslie! I knew him from times past!” she said, shaking her head, all jolly once again. “He would have gotten away with that for
Greg laughed a little, and Mycroft felt his hot breath on his most sensitive skin. “That’s a yes, then,” Greg growled, grinning, and he dropped his gaze and his head and set to work.
“This?” he said, sliding it under some paperwork none-too-discretely, “Ahhh…Just…dealing with it. It’s a…w—er...witness statement.”
I was grateful to her for saving me, I became really fond of her, but she could never be...I never loved her like I loved..." and here he stopped and closed his mouth like a trap, and looked forcefully at Sherlock, and Sherlock was struck suddenly that John looked at him now exactly like he had in the restaurant with Mary, when Sherlock had appeared at their table - alive after all and full of the joy of
“Ooh, I like the way you said that,” growled Greg darkly, leaning back in to briefly kiss Mycroft’s neck again and he made a little sound of his own deep in his throat, like a pleased sort of purry rumble. Then he said, as if considering how much, “Actually, I
John stared dejectedly at the screen, chin resting on one hand, and with the other hand he drummed his fingers on the table. Then he leaned back in his chair and gave in and asked Sherlock, who was sitting silently reading at the table opposite him, "What did he say, you know, when you confronted him? At the end?"
“Clotted cream in the fridge,” Clarissa said loudly to Gabriella, and turned back to John and Sherlock. “So how do you all know each other? What’s the story here?” she asked, smiling encouragingly and perching on the arm of one of the empty armchairs. John looked at Sherlock.
There was a very short hallway next to the staircase which clearly lead to the downstairs loo - John could see another back door to the garden at the end of it. As Lucia started up the stairs - like she meant business, John thought - she called out slightly crossly to the unseen Siger, “Hurry up with Percy’s bowls!… And
Sherlock, however, lay still in their bed; half on his phone, half drinking the coffee John had just taken him and lazily answering him through the open door. Well, actually, John wasn’t moaning about the
“Well, look, I’ll go out on the balcony so I don’t make everything stink a’ smoke - especially your stuff.”
turn…” and he pushed Mycroft up and off by his shoulder and waist and shifted himself sideways under Mycroft to get out from underneath, turning as he moved to flip Mycroft over onto his back on the bed. Then he slid on top of his lover, lying almost directly between his long legs. Mycroft moaned out loud at the change of sensation and as he wrapped his calves around Gregory’s again, and felt the new firmer friction as Greg began to move once more, he actually growled in response. “Oh, that’s so
“It makes me wonder what it would be like to—” he paused and then finished, “—to sleep together…” He had said it almost directly into Mycroft’s waiting ear.
The blue shed and the pier were now clearly visible a little distance away. "Come on then," said John, "I can see it," and then he stopped and pointed. “Hey, Sherlock, there’s someone sitting there!”
“Good evening to you, David,” replied Mycroft suavely, “and yes, please, but do give me a moment if you would, I’m just deliberating….” he scanned the optics behind the bar, considering.
Mycroft smiled back, delighted. He was quite sure Greg had been thinking something a little more personal than that, but he’d managed to sidestep the question easily. How very thrilling this all was, he thought. It was like a game. And this evening, he had realised that he could play this game very well, in fact.
…in Gregory Lestrade’s really quite beautiful bed, in his really quite messy bedroom, and his usually really quite stoic and sedate little heart simply
And here, Gabriella's voice lifted as she did a very passable impression of the anguished gallery owner. “ 'Oh, but he must!’, she said to me, ‘I’ve made two sales for him already, people want to speak to him - they might want to commission him, he
“Ooh, thank you, Sherlock!” she said as she took it. “Perfect timing! Lovely!” Sherlock didn’t bother to even answer but came and stood next to John again.
note that I hand-wrote yesterday was to the Prime Minister of Papua New Guinea, asking him if he—” he stopped, aware that in his confusion he was babbling a bit about something that he should not be babbling about. “Look, do you still have the note?” he demanded instead, changing tack.
But then, for her to up and tell him this morning that it was never going to work, and it was over between them anyway because she loved someone else who wanted her more. She was going back to her ex-husband, the man John had literally known nothing about, the man who had left
John pleaded, "No. No, Sherlock," and Sherlock realised in the cold wind that his face was wet, and though he had thought for a moment that it was from Moriarty's blood, or rain, he realised then it wasn't; it was from his tears. And this time they were no act.
At 7.59 p.m., Mycroft stepped out of the anonymous black cab at the kerb outside Constantine’s. ‘How the hell did Gregory know about Constantine’s?’ he wondered. He certainly hadn’t mentioned the place when they’d been chatting. Mind you, he mused, on second thoughts, he wasn't absolutely sure
Blunt, unadorned and as passionately honest as Gregory’s words were, to Mycroft they made the most eloquent of love sonnets. Mycroft laughed a little and then sighed in rapture. “There’s nothing I want more right now than to do that,” he replied.
…To hear Sherlock moaning and gasping John’s name as John worked on his neck with everything he had to offer, moved his hand and and fist and fingers on Sherlock’s cock, delved deeper into Sherlock’s expensive underwear and then with both hands, pulled them down further over his lean hips to cup and squeeze and then stroke his bollocks lightly, as John liked to be stroked. Sherlock’s hot gasped reply as John murmured his name into his ear - and oh,
low and deep and rough at the back of his throat through gritted teeth, and the way he said it crashed into Mycroft’s auditory memory palace, flung itself about and knocked down walls. Greg thrust himself hard against Mycroft in an exhilarating burst of pleasure. He did this three times more, building up a rhythm again before Mycroft grasped Greg’s shoulders and held him still to stop him. “Wait,” he gasped urgently,
It was a quick walk to the station from Gabriella’s and they made the train with around four minutes to spare. It pulled into the station bang on time almost the moment they stepped out onto the platform. It had got very dark very quickly, and while John had already thought it had turned quite cold while they had been inside at Gabriella’s and Clarissa’s; it seemed to have got colder still on the walk back to the train station. John was very grateful to get off the exposed platform and step up on to the relatively much warmer train. It was a very quiet train too, being so late on a Sunday afternoon in January; though the first carriage they got on to had a couple of noisy families with small children, so they walked back along the train’s length to find an empty carriage. The darkness outside and the now empty platform seemed to press against the glass and the brightly lit carriages, strangely making John’s good mood slip a little.
With the scarf in his hand, he went and got Sherlock’s other present from his underwear drawer where he’d hidden it and put it in his pocket, along with the one he’d just gone out and collected. He was feeling a bit guilty now, in that he’d just blankly assumed Sherlock wouldn’t even know what the day was. Sherlock had obviously gone to so much trouble and expense to get him such a lovely gift,
he said, practically purring the words, and allowing his the corner of his mouth to lift even further as he did so.
“Mmmm,” said Sally, believing that like she believed in fairies. She crossed her arms. “Not a Valentine’s card, then?” she asked, grinning impishly. “Who’s it from, Mrs. Lestrade, requesting a little romantic rendezvous?” She made a face to show she was just winding him up.
He gave a mock shiver of fear at the thought of it, the comical boyishness of the gesture making Mycroft’s heart leap unexpectedly. “Oh, well, come on,” Greg continued, turning to go up his garden path, “let’s go in…I’ve promised you cheap scotch, ‘aven’t I?!” He led the way up the path, getting his keys out from his jacket pocket as he went and not letting go of Mycroft’s hand as he dug around for them. Mycroft was still slightly surprised by the comedian comment, almost dazed, even -
John did that thing where he drew his chin into his neck and raised his eyebrows in confusion. Sherlock noticed this but ignored it and didn’t let it make him smile. “‘The Case of the Octogenarian Art Fraudster’, yes, we did,” Sherlock said placidly, still not looking at John, but managing to note John’s instant
Maybe he couldn't say that yet, and maybe neither could Sherlock, but their words earlier had made their feelings clear enough. And now, still held in each other's arms, their bodies began to speak to each other too.
asked Sherlock's subconscious suddenly. It often asked questions, sometimes it posed as someone else, sometimes it was just a voiceless voice in his head. Sometimes these questions helped him solve a case, and so were useful and helpful, but sometimes his subconscious was annoying and asked questions he didn't want to answer. Like this one, which he ignored.
John, still smiling, didn’t answer, assuming he meant in regards to John's career change as a consulting detective's assistant and personal physician.
If it doesn’t move at all, it means ‘Cold fish’…” He looked up at the table. “…Are we all ok with that?”
Gregory was referring to. Like a match to dynamite, Greg bent and lit the fuse. “What I said earlier...” he began, “are you still...d’you still wanna...?” he tipped his head to indicate the direction of the stairs. He lifted his eyebrows and smiled.
In the corner of the room opposite the en-suite door and next to the voluminous curtains, was a huge, old, free-standing wardrobe - walnut from the dark colour and 1920’s from the style, Mycroft had thought when he saw it. Greg went over and opened the thing and found an empty hanger. He hung the waistcoat on it and went to do it up, but the hanger was smooth and shiny and the silk lining of the waistcoat made it slip off to the floor, so Greg bent and picked it up and tried a second time. But before he could get the buttons done up to fasten it in place, the same thing happened again.
“Oh, they were so terrible to each other, John,” said Lucia. She waved her arm in excitement. “Sigs, tell John about the time when—” at that moment, Sherlock stood up abruptly, his potatoes completed.
“Oh, Clarissa's back," she remarked, but more to herself as John wiped his feet on the doormat and Sherlock reappeared behind him.
- it was incendiary to John’s desire…the way Sherlock kissed, his mouth, his voice, his long body straining under John, one strong hand and long fingers on John’s cock, the other sliding up John’s back and the nape of his neck and on up into and through John’s hair, and the smell of him; familiar but fiery and amplified by sweat and sex.
his hands roving hungrily on Greg’s smooth, broad back; one up to his shoulder, one sliding down to his lovely arse. “What do you mean,
“Where’s yer tie gone?” asked Greg, wondering about its very conspicuous sudden absence. Mycroft smiled and patted his trouser pocket, where the neatly rolled tie now resided, tucked in like a tidy Swiss roll. “In here,” he said. Greg smiled back at his innate orderliness.
“She is, you know!” agreed Siger, reaching for the bottle and pouring himself more wine. He poured some into any of the empty glasses he could reach which contained clear evidence of the previous red, and then handed the bottle to Agatha, who poured for John and Sherlock - he didn’t refuse this time - and then she nestled the bottle safely next to her plate, within easy reach.
“Well. Cheers!” said Greg quickly to Mycroft, proffering his glass. Mycroft lifted up his own and clinked it.
That was all the encouragement John needed to forget both Mary and all that had come between him and Sherlock. She was gone and now he was free to choose. And he had chosen Sherlock with all his heart and soul.
In the shadowy dimness of the room, lit now by the full moon and the soft glow of the lamp, he was like a pale flame in the night. “You look…
So; Sherlock realised. And he kept his new knowledge hidden. Even his subconscious shut up about it after that, because it had got what it wanted; he had
smile playing on his face. His eyes roved southwards down Mycroft’s body and back up again in quite a leisurely fashion. He hadn’t said a single word yet, but the flirtation mode in Greg’s brain had powered up again and it was running at full strength.
But Greg looked up. “He’s in the Fraud Squad,” Greg clarified. “He’s a really good friend of mine. Knows Mike Stamf—“ he stopped. “Do you know Mike Stamford?”
That induced a bout of raucous laughter from everyone in the kitchen, and John flicked a glance at Sherlock, who was now staring fixedly out of the window, gripping the arms of the chair, his book forgotten in his lap. John could see his toes were twitching in his shoes.
widely. This amount of smiling must be some kind of record. He couldn’t remember the last time he’d been this happy. “Oh, I don’t see any problem here,” he said smoothly, around the smile.
John peered over at her hands. She was struggling with a tiny cellophane envelope which held a printed slip of paper and a flimsy red piece of film, in the shape of a fish.
Mycroft snorted a short little involuntary laugh. All this amusement and laughing, he still could hardly believe it. He was almost shocked at himself - let alone the fact that his own family possibly wouldn’t recognise him. Meanwhile, Greg had continued. “…I’ve got real coffee on the go for me that’s nearly done, there’s plenty o’ that, and I’ve got Yorkshire tea, loads of different herbal ones or cheap Tesco red label, if you prefer tea?” Greg said, quite unaware of the earth-shattering revelations that were still going on in Mycroft’s head this morning.
In response, Sherlock made another minimal shake of the head. John saw that Sherlock was using his arm on that side almost normally. Which was good. And he was breathing normally, which was even more important. Sherlock discretely dropped his pretend gun in his other pocket before the police arrived. "Pressure," said John, discretely, with a tip of his head indicate that he meant Sherlock needed to put pressure on his wound. And then the car park was filled with the beautiful music of a police siren and the very welcome bathing of blue lights, and John and Sherlock were able to deliver the two injured thugs, along with their charming array of weapons, to Lestrade and Donovan, and get on with the really important stuff. Away from the police, out of sight of the two criminals, John grabbed Sherlock's good arm and turned him around carefully. "A stab wound, Sherlock? How bad is it really?" he asked, pushing the lapel of Sherlock's coat to the side to see.
“You certainly seemed to be enjoying yourself,” Mycroft said, primly on purpose, and Greg burst out laughing himself. “You’re so bloody pleased with yourself, aren’t yer? Silver-tongued in more ways than one, eh?” he said, still grinning, sweeping a hand through Mycroft’s slightly excitable hair.
"Ridiculous American cars with their excessive bonnet adornments," growled Sherlock. "Caught me right between the shoulder blades."
John placed the fish carefully onto Sherlock's palm and they all watched with what felt like bated breath to see what the fish would do.
Greg grinned up at him and looked into his eyes. His hands moved up again to Mycroft’s hips and now he pushed Mycroft backwards slightly and slid slowly forwards off the bed, to land surprisingly lightly with one knee either side of Mycroft’s feet. Without looking away, he brought his fingers round to the open fly of Mycroft’s trousers and the top of his underwear and, lifting them away from his skin, began to slide the both of them down as one over his lover’s lean hips.
gasped Sherlock instantly, and he squeezed John’s cock hard, drawing his other hand sudden and hard up John’s back, his long fingers firm, the nails lightly scoring reddened lines of desire into John’s flesh.
white being all the frost and snow - fills the churchyard…meaning, the mild weather kills more people, because all the bugs and germs don’t get killed off in the cold weather so they end up…er…killing
Then Gabriella said suddenly, "Well, I –" at the exact same time that Clarissa said, "That's totally …that’s amazing!” again.
John took it and held it lightly by the tail for a moment to cool, then turned his empty palm upwards and carefully placed the fish onto it with an over-elaborated twirling of his wrist. The fish almost immediately began to curl, both head and tail, and then as they all watched, it rolled entirely into a tiny red tube and rocked gently in John's slightly cupped palm.
While John was in Tesco’s, deciphering Sherlock’s scrawled additions to his list, Mycroft was at his desk speed reading an urgent missive from the foreign office in Venezuela. Suddenly Anthea popped her head through the doorway. “A note, sir,” she said, producing a sealed white envelope and holding it out delicately between finger and thumb. She seemed somewhat bemused.
like some people had said about him. It was not that mundane or clumsy - it was so often much more explosive than that. As if he'd almost seen it all along, but had just been looking at it from slightly the wrong angle, or it had been there but been blurred, and then suddenly something changed in a burst of high frequency energy and he had just
but he said nothing about it. “Oh he's busy, just saving the universe, this time, I think,” he said instead, and Lucia shot him a sharp look.
John pulled a face to himself, wondering how many times now they had had a cryptic exchange like that one, and followed him up.
Gabriella glanced over at him. ”You’re very proud of him, aren't you?" she asked perceptively with a wry smile, tilting her head in Sherlock’s direction.
Greg smiled, the lines on his face deepening attractively. His eyes were very warm. “Well. I suppose we do,” he agreed. The smile never left his face. He looked down at the thick cream-coloured menu before him, still smiling. “Are we going for starters as well, then, or straight to the main?” he asked, running a finger down the list of dishes as he scanned them; rather charmingly, Mycroft thought. “When I came with Zac we had the duck for starters,” Greg continued, musingly, “but it was so fantastic I wished I’d ‘ad it as my main course…” but Mycroft’s attention had caught unpleasantly on the male name in that sentence.
“I enjoy cooking, John,’ Siger said genuinely, when John asked him about it. “…It’s very relaxing, I find…” he added, and he took a big hearty sip of his wine as he stirred the gravy. Lucia and he were making it a few hours ahead of the evening meal, he explained to John, so they could spend less time cooking away from everyone later in the evening. They were using a huge roasting tray to make it in, with stock, flour and various vegetables that had already been roasted in the oven.
Sherlock looked up at John steadily. “As I said, why do you even need to hear it? You met him, you heard how he spoke. You can guess what he would have said to me and I can assure you, you won’t be able to use any of it anyway.”
he thought. But it would have been far quicker to just run upstairs and grab his phone from where it was charging on his old bedside table. He shook his head at himself in disdain. However, as he picked up the elusive calculator, the large wad of police reports started to slide out of his hand. He managed to hang onto those - and the calculator, just - but the folded sheet of A4 he’d balanced on top of the police papers dropped to the floor, and it opened up a bit when it landed.
have just got down by itself when the storm really got going anyway, as anyone could see where the cat's claws had left numerous fresh scratch marks going down the trunk directly above where the body had been found anyway, and then it transpired via a phone call to the officers searching the deceased man's home that; yes, there was a cat, and yes, it was at home, safe and sound, etcetera, etcetera, etcetera.
….Also I looked at your Google search history once, after you’d used my laptop, and his name was on there. So I had to check him out….”
John still had his fingers on Sherlock's chin and jaw where he had turned his face away to look at the bruise. He turned Sherlock back to face him again, noting the second much paler, mauve bruise in the centre of his forehead, and he began thinking about concussion or brain trauma. He looked at Sherlock's pupils very carefully. And they were quite even and looked normal. Sherlock knew John was assessing his pupils for signs of concussion or brain trauma and he let John look. And then he very deliberately thought the secret thought that he had been holding in his head for so long, and he let the essence of that thought come through in his gaze. He didn't know if John would see it or not. And, as John was examining Sherlock's pupils...did he imagine it, or...did the air change somehow? Something in the atmosphere was subtly altered. And then John
Mycroft glanced at Sherlock and Sherlock glanced at Mycroft. No words were needed. John could read everything on their faces.
Her accent was wholly well-spoken English, but very unusual, with some words spoken in a way that was familiar to John - though he couldn’t quite place it. “Where did you grow up?” he asked, “if you don’t mind me asking? There’s something about your accent that’s really familiar but I can’t quite place it.”
