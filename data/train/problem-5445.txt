Bobby glares out the door at the receding sight of the Impala, and Dean doesn’t know why he always feels safer with Bobby when he’s angry at John. Dean’s never able to work up that kind of wrath on his own for his father.
aloud, she mutes the TV and lays on the bed next to him.
Dean nods stiffly.
“What I don’t understand is… where is your hunger, Dean?”
“That’s a good one. Sontag’s a great writer.”
Dean for the first time in her life wants to say no. Say she’s not sure what kind of girl she is. Say she’s not even sure what “that kind of girl” is.
Very carefully he peels the angel off of him and puts him to the side of his bed. He walks slowly and quietly out of the room to the closest bathroom but runs into Sam with his duffel.
Dean looked nervous for a second but gestured towards the front seat.
“Earlier. When it went to pitch black, the thing was back but Crowley saved me” Dean interrupts him.
Two hours later it comes.
“What are you grinning about?” he said with his eyebrows raised.
a damn angel of the lord for Christ’s sake. And your brother. Speaking of where is Sammy?”
“Who’s getting married?”
a good father. Abuse lined his boyfriend’s childhood, and it was at the core of Dean’s emotional problems.
“So what are we watching?”
He had a plan. Sam would kill him and maybe that would be enough for Chuck…
.” “Dean-I’m sorry. I didn’t know. I remember.” “Remember what?” “What you said in the warehouse, I just left it alone, because I thought you had only said it in the heat of the moment, but I understand now.” He recalls, his broken voice yelling out for the angel.
“He went to Sioux Falls, Bobby had a lot of old books in the archive up there. Sammy thinks that it may help with whatever it is that thing did to you.”
“Wouldn’t that make you uncomfortable?”
Dean's POV After giving the first blowjob of his life he kissed his angel and sighed in happiness. Never had he felt like this before, he had come close many times with Cassie and Lisa but they were one night stands compared to Cas. For a long time he only cared about his little brother being safe, but since he met the angel in the barn things had changed. It wasn't until after purgatory did he know that he was head over heels in love with the angel. His angel. How could he be so stupid for so long? It was right there in front of his face, literally. Cas often stood very close to him and before he never would have admitted that he enjoyed it but now he could have him as close as he liked. "I love you." he said kissing the dark hair on his angels head. Cas was snoring softly, sleeping on his chest, guess it took more out of him than what he thought. Now was probably the best time to catch up on his sleep also. Pulling the covers over him and the angel he adjusted himself a bit before laying his head down on the angels. This was something he could get used to, most definitely. *Hours Later* Barely awake he rolled over and woke with a start. Had he dreamed him and Cas sleeping together? Dammit. It wouldn't be the first time it had happened but he was hurt that i wasn't real. Getting up he stretched and checked the clock it was 5:40 in the afternoon, that was a hell of a nap he took. "Hello Dean." Cas was standing at the foot of the bed in Dean's clothes. "I hope you don't mind, I borrowed some of your clothes again." "No of course I don't mind. Uh Cas?" "Yes Dean?" "How long have you been in here?" "I'm not sure what time we fell asleep but I've been up for about five minutes, I only got up to put some clothes on in case Sam or Kevin walked in." So it hadn't been a dream. Thank god. "I thought I had dreamed it." "No, it was very real. I enjoyed it, and I didn't have a single nightmare. Thank you Dean." "No problem, come back to bed. Please?" Cas moved to where Dean was sitting up on the bed and kissed him before pulling him up. "I'm hungry, can we eat something first?" "Yeah I'll make you something to eat come on."
“O-okay. Just be careful, please.”
“Goodnight Dean.”
“I’ve never really closely listened to any music Dean.”
“Cas… I love-.”
“Morning Cas. Breakfast will be ready soon.”
“Very clever.” The empty was brilliant at coming up with new ways to hurt him and he couldn’t deny this pain.
Leaving the small town of Brooks he sighs, his two boys in the back seat would have to change schools once again. It couldn’t be helped, he was close to finding it. So close, that he could taste it.
“Cas, where are you going?”
Dean and Cas moved out after a few years into the mountains. They have a greenhouse, a garage where Dean can work on cars, and of course a beehive farm for Cas. No kids other than Jack, who visits often, but plenty of rescue animals. A guinea pig, some cats, a horse for Dean, plenty of bees, and Miracle the dog. Sam occasionally will call him for some help on a hunt but other than they he hung it up and never looked back. Claire and Kai come over to crash occasionally and have even talked about getting married. Dean brings up the possibility of marriage to Cas, but always laughs at the realness of it. After being through hell and back, what did they care if they had a piece of paper to prove it? Everything they needed they had in each other.
“Dean.” “Cas? You’re alive?” “Yes, very much so, alive and human. Is Sam okay?” “You heard my prayer.” “A little bit, since I’m human the signal is broken but I heard Sam, so I figured he was in danger.” “He’ll be fine, he couldn’t finish the trials because it would have killed him. I know it was selfish but I couldn’t let him do it. I’m sorry.” “Dean, don’t be. We can figure out another way, I’m the one who should apologize, I’m useless now. I don’t even know what’s going on, my stomach is growling and I have this dry taste in my mouth.” “Cas, you’re human now, that means eating, sleeping and staying hydrated. Where are you?” “I’m at a Gas N Sip somewhere, I’m not sure where.” “Okay, grab a newspaper and look at the title.” “Okay, hold on.” Leaving the phone dangling he went inside to look at the newspaper, he ran back outside. “I’m in Holland, Ohio. What do I do? I don’t have enough money for a hotel Dean.” “Stay there, I’ll come get you, I’m about an hour or two out from there but I can’t go until Sam wakes up. So sit tight.” “I can come to you Dean. I can figure out how to hot wire a car.” “No, you’re human now and that means you can feel pain so sit tight. I’ll come get you.” “I’ll just wait here then.” “And Cas?” “Yes Dean.” “Lay low until I get there, who knows what’s after you right now.” “You’re right, thank you Dean.” “Steal a car to sleep in tonight and drive it somewhere off the reserve that’s close to the Gas N Sip. Use that money to buy yourself some food and water. I’ll call you when I’m on the road, okay?” “Okay.” “Bye.” He hung up quickly to hide the sob trying to escape his throat.
“I eat salads when I can, but a burger actually sounds pretty good right now, let’s go.”
With his arms around the hunter’s neck, Cas leans up to kiss his hunter once more. Going to pull away, Dean chuckles. “Two can play that game angel.”
Dean begins to stroke the angels face again, running his thumb along Cas’s cheek. “I don’t want to go to fast, I want us to last forever. So if that means taking it a little slow at first, then so be it, because it’s been a long time since I’ve been with anybody for anything other than just sex. But with you, I’d give up all the sex in the world just to have you, but now I’m here thinking about us having sex, and I don’t know if were ready for that just yet. I’ve never been with another man before so it’s going to take some time for me to get used to it. But this- I don’t think I’ll ever get over having your soft lips on mine, especially on my neck. Dammit Cas. Why did we wait so long to do this?”
“There aren’t any bottles back there?”
“Really?”
The words still stung, but not as much as the hurt look on the angel’s face did. If Sam’s life wasn’t in the balance he never would have kicked him out, he didn’t want Cas to leave,
“After that? Hell no! If I wasn’t so tired, we would do
it. Perhaps, he too would enjoy Dean’s selection.
Dean obviously was trying to distract him from the movie
“I’ve never kissed a guy before. What if I don’t like it? I don’t want to hurt you or ruin the relationship if I’m not into it.” They were both nervous.
He leaned in again and kissed Dean once more before pulling back to stare at him. This was a new and interesting feeling that he didn’t want to end.
“I’m not evil Castiel, not in my purest form. Yes, I read your mind. Don’t fret too much over it, that’s not why I’m here. I’m tied to you because of this flimsy grace you had so I’m going to give it back, but I want you to do something for me.”
“I’m also going to tease you every chance I get. I like the look on your face. Come on lets watch the movie.”
Getting up, he looks at his son who is now a man. “Dean.” They embrace each other tightly, holding on for life. John is trembling with emotion.
Flipping through the old text, Sam sighs out loud. It was time to call it, Cas being human couldn’t be undone, unless he stole another angel’s grace, which he doubted would ever happen again.
“I always have. Don’t know why it took me so long to say it, or realize it for that matter. But when you left, when you’re gone, I’m not happy. I’m miserable. Every single time you were taken or vaporized or just flat out killed, it eats me up inside. Every other time, I have been able to just block it out and focus on the current world ending crisis at hand...But this time, even after defeating Chuck and saving the world. Something was missing.I would look around and just miss you in everything that happened. I tried to move on, be happy that we had saved the world. We stopped hunting, Sam  and I got a dog, he’s with Eileen, life was supposed to be good. Great even. Everything seemed to be in place. Except you..”
Visibly struggling against the dream the angel grabs ahold of Dean’s blanket in his fist and twists it around. He begins to stroke the angel’s hair to calm him down, and it seems to work. Soon, Cas is asleep against his chest sleeping peacefully.
Chapter Two: Deestiel.
Suddenly another Dean appeared. This one, different. Off putting and cold. He knew that wasn’t his Dean.
“He’s not coming, Castiel. Give it up…”
Dean's POV
“Not so fun now, is it? It’s called an erection Cas, I’ll help, but not here. Come on.”
“Figured you might change your mind. If not, Dean here can drink it.” He nods and she is on her way to the kitchen.
SET AFTER 15X18, CODA TYPE OF FIC.
“Yes! Don’t you bloody listen?”
Sitting up slowly, his head began to spin so he decides against the original notion. His body ached all over, but his head was throbbing in ways he didn’t think humans could endure. “Easy there tiger. Not so fast, you’re dinged up pretty bad.” Dean is above him. “Why are we in the back of the Impala?” “I didn’t want to wake you up, and it wasn’t long, Sam only went inside about twenty minutes ago.” He nods, but even the small movement hurts, “Being a human hurts, I’ve never felt such throbbing pain in my head before.” “You’ve obviously never had a bad hangover. Let’s get you inside and I’ll get you some ibuprofen.” Trying to move again, he is still too sore to even lift his head. Dean crawls out of baby and reaches in to help him out, putting the angel’s arm around his neck, picking him up once more. “If I’d known I was going to carry you in again, I would have done it twenty minutes ago.” “Dean, I’m sorry. You’re obviously uncomfortable with this, and” Shaking his head no Dean stops him “its fine Cas, just don’t think this is going to become a regular thing.” “I wouldn’t dream of it. But I think it’s the least you can do after I carried you out of hell.”
Chapter Two: Sioux Fall’s High.
“Oh all over, Tennessee, Texas, Kansas. My mom liked to move a lot. Kind of blended me into one giant hick if you ask me, I hate my accent. I’ve tried to change it but the darn thing won’t go away.”
It made his whole body go rigid. How dumb could he be? Of course that was the answer. To get Cas out, he would have to be human.
“It gets annoying doesn’t it? And you’re not short yourself, but it’s fine. I’ve met crazed fans and you are not one of them.”
home Dean, not mine. I can’t keep guessing at where I belong, it used to be so natural. When I was younger I
“Don’t mention it, so much for going slow eh?”
Somehow Dean missed that snarky demon. They had a past sure, but it was more of an anti-friendship, but after he became a demon something changed. They had bonded, and hell Crowley was close to being human at one point. Sam wouldn’t agree he knew that, and neither would Cas but he had to at least talk to him. “You rang squirrel? Which of the Winchester’s has died this time?” “Very funny.” “Where’s Moose and wings?” “Out, but that’s what I wanted to talk to you about. Protection. See I’m retiring but Sam is still in the business and I need you to make me a promise, not a deal, a promise. From one friend to another, for old times’ sake huh?” “Depends. What is it you require?” “I need you to call back some of your demons, not all of them but minimize it. Start making deals with the next Hitler’s or something, but no more humans man okay? We didn’t close the gates of hell because it would have killed Sam, but we could have continued in making you human. You know that right?” “Of course I bloody know that. I also know that you didn’t trap me which is either very foolish or very trusting. I’m going to go with trusting, for now, but if you want protection I only require one thing. Rowena. That stupid bitch had Cas almost kill me. Lucky for you, you little love bird, I knew the reverse spell.” “Wait how do you know about me and Cas?” “Who doesn’t know about the fallen angel and the wayward hunter he rebelled for? I mean come on! You two are all anybody upstairs and downstairs talked about!” Huh he never knew that. “It’s already done. A new hunter named Sally Simon took her out just last week on a ruguru hunt. She was in the way is what I’m told, burned to ashes.” “I’ll have to look into that for myself but job well done then. And Sally Simon? Really Dean, haven’t we gotten past lying to each other? I know Sally is Gabriel, he’s been boasting about his smoking new bod and beau since he reappeared.” “Dammit Gabe. I told him to keep a low profile.” Suddenly Crowley was gone but reappeared after a brief moment with grin. “You’re right the wicked bitch I mean witch. No actually I take it back, I know what I meant. She was a total bitch and awful mother. Anyways you got it bestie. Cheers to you. Good luck and I’ll tell my black eyed darlings to lay off, I promise. But I want to meet the little bugger when you have her.” “As if. You’ll meet her one of these days, but not for a long time. Maybe one day we can have you over for a bbq and a swim.” “Perhaps. Tell Moose I said Hello.” “Will do.” Knowing he would have to tell Cas he sighed, and walked towards his room. “Babe?” “In here honey.” When he found him he was packing some of their stuff in boxes. “We need to talk.” The angel grew pale and looked up “What is it Dean?” “It’s about Crowley. I know you two haven’t gotten along well in the past but he’s changed.” “Dean he’s a demon.” “I know but for a short while so was I and you still loved me. Besides, he’s not that bad. When Sam and I were doing the trials we we’re changing him into a human remember?” When the angel nodded he continued, “Well some part of him still is, I mean I killed more when I had the mark of cain alone then when I was a demon. He also said that he was going to pull back on his deals. He can be useful babe, and if I’m going to retire I want there to be some security.” “I don’t know, I still don’t trust him.” “Hey I didn’t trust your brother fully and now he’s family.” “I don’t want to argue about this, if you want to be friends with a demon who am I to stop you, but I don’t want him around Eliza, hell I don’t want him to even know about me and you.” “Too late, he keeps tabs on everything. He even knew about Sam and Gabe. He thinks we’re besties, and we used to be somewhat.” “He knows about everything?” “Yeah he said Gabe has been bragging about it. Not that I blame him, my brothers a hit.” Cas still looked upset, “He’s going to ruin everything.” “No, he won’t. I won’t let anybody ruin this.” He took the box from the angel’s hands and pulled him up, “I would never let anybody or anything hurt us. That’s why I need Crowley. I know I’m a hell of a hunter, but I can only do so much. I need us to be safe. I need Eliza to be safe. “She will be. In case you forgot Gabriel is full power. He wasn’t affected by the fall because he’s been on earth for so long. He’s always going to be around to protect us.” “No he won’t. I need him to protect my brother, and if he’s split in between doing both one of us will get hurt.” “I still don’t like it.” Leaning in to kiss his angel’s doubts away he was surprised when Cas moved his face away. “No. I have to finish packing.” “Don’t be like that babe. I don’t want you to be mad at me.” “I’m not. We need to pack, and I’m doing that. Go watch Game of Thrones or something if you’re not going to help.” Sighing he left the room upset that him and his angel were fighting. Sam was already on the couch watching the third season of the show with Gabe sitting in his lap. It was like they lived in that spot, stupid teenagers. “How was your meeting with Crowley?” Gabe said as he grinned wickedly. “Actually I need to talk to you about that. Why have you been bragging about dating my brother and Cas and I’s kid?” “What? A girl can’t dish about how well her life is going to a couple of demons and vamps now and again?” Removing Gabe from his lap Sam looked upset, “What the hell? You’re talking to demons?” “Yeah? So? They’re good people, not all demons are bad. You of all people should know that with you two’s history.” To his surprise Sam shrugged his shoulders and sighed. “You’re right. I’m sorry I over reacted. Who am I to judge who you’re friends with. Just be more careful who you tell things to okay?” “I will, I’m sorry too. I should be more careful. It’s just I’m so happy that we’re together I couldn’t help but brag about it.” Pulling Gabe back into his lap he kissed him. “I love you.” “I love you too.” “Come on. Get a room. Sam Crowley said to tell Moose he said hello.” “And that’s another thing, why are you meeting with the king of douches?” “Because I need protection for me and my family. With my retiring and all I need to be sure that’ll everyone will be safe.” “Hello famous mighty powerful archangel. Gabriel. Nice to meet you Dean-o.” “Can it. I need you to protect Sam and you can’t protect him and my family 24/7. You just focus on Sam. Okay?” “Dean, I don’t anybody to protect me. I’m a big boy okay?” “No Sam, he’s right. Last week on that ghost case you were almost choked. If it weren’t for me you would have died.” “We burned the wrong bones. Story of my life. Fine, but don’t treat me like a 5 year old. Okay?” “Aw does lil Sammy want a cookie?” “Ugh stop Gabe.” Now they were play fighting on the couch, jealous that Cas and him didn’t make up that quickly he walked away. “Damn angels” he mumbled under his breath heading into the kitchen to eat his feelings. Looking for some pie he grunted when he couldn’t find any, he must have eaten it all. Finding some hamburger meat in the freezer he decided to cook himself a burger instead. When he was done he sat at the table thinking about his angel. He hated fighting with him, it reminded him all too well of the many times they had actually fought. It made sense why he was mad at him, he had gone behind his back and made a deal with the devil. Well not literally but to the angel it was all the same. “Dean.” Looking up from his burger he sighed. Right now he didn’t want to talk to anybody but Cas. “What Sammy.” Grabbing a burger from the plate the younger Winchester clicked his tongue. “You shouldn’t be in here eating your feelings. Go talk to him.” He put his hand up and pointed at his full mouth. Sam rolled his eyes, “Listen I know that you’re new at this whole commitment thing and I get it. It’s new, but when you’re involved with someone long term like you and Cas are you have to discuss all the decisions you make together. No more flying solo” Ugh he hated when his little brother was right. “Can it with the romantic comedy stuff. This is real life.” “Exactly Dean, you’re not going to magically make up just because. You have to apologize and fix what you did wrong. And not in the next year, now. The sooner, the better.” He got up and left his brother in the kitchen, “Don’t say I told you so.” Walking to his room he was surprised when Cas wasn’t packing but was instead sleeping on their bed. Crawling up next to him gently as to not wake him up he stroked the angels bed hair. “I’m sorry babe. I’ll never go behind your back again, from now on we’ll make all of our decisions together. I swear. I hate fighting with you sweetie. I just hope you still want to have a future together.” When his angel shifted on the bed flinching he sighed. What could he be dreaming about? It was obvious that he was having some sort of nightmare but unlike the angel he couldn’t see into the dream. Instead he decided he would try to sing to his angel, “Someday when I’m awfully low, when the world is cold, I will feel a glow just thinking of you. And the way you look tonight.” Smiling he stroked his angel’s hair again, “You’re so beautiful babe, I love you so much and I would do anything to keep you and our little girl safe.” “Why did you stop singing Dean?” “Hey you’re awake. I’m sorry, I don’t want to fight.” “I know, I heard everything. I was only barely asleep. You never told me you could sing though.” “I can’t and if I did then you would never sing to me anymore and that would suck because I like to hear you sing.” “Well sometimes it’s nice to be sang to also honey.” “You called me honey. Does that mean we’re okay?” “Never better, now that I know that you can sing, you’re never going to talk again. Sing everything.” “No no nooooo” They laughed at his sing songy reply, “Okay but every now and again you should. It’s really lovely.” “Not as lovely as you.” He hummed in agreement and laid his head against his chest. “Sing to me Dean.” “Okay.” “L is for the way you look at me, O is for the only one I see, V is very very extra ordinary,” “Since when do you listen to love songs anyways?” “Since purgatory after I found you.” “Oh. Continue.” “Wise men say only fools rush in, but I can’t help falling in love with you.” They stayed there all afternoon singing to each other and laying in each other’s arms.
Dean shakes his head “I wouldn’t dream of it”
myself. Goodbye Dean.”
Getting up to talk to Sam, he hears a small whimper beside him, “I’ll be back in a minute can you pause it?” They’ve moved from fucking to Allie waking up in bed to find roses scattered everywhere. Castiel’s hydrangea blue eyes are still glued to the screen and he huffs. “Sure.”
There was only one more week left until Eliza would arrive and they were all excited. Their house was decorated and Cas and Dean would move in with Eliza soon. The baby room was a pale yellow with brown polka dots, they had decided giraffes would be the theme. It was filled with giraffes, there was giraffe bedding, stuffed animals and baby toys. The one thing they didn’t have was giraffe clothing. Dean had bought most of her clothing and it all consisted of some type of rock band or nerd thing. Not that he minded he loved the adorable onesies and socks their daughter would wear. Uncle Sammy and Sally were throwing them a baby shower tonight and Dean was making pie and burgers for everybody. Over the past couple of months as Eliza’s birth grew closer so did Cas’s humanity. The angel now slept, used the bathroom and ate like a normal person. His favorite by far was eating, he loved how good Dean’s cooking was and had to up his workout routine because he was starting to get pudgy like his hunter. At nighttime after they ate dinner, and drank a couple of beers they would put on a record and dance slowly in the middle of the floor. Sometimes Gabe and Sam laughed at them but then joined them but only every now and then. Tonight they’re would be a lot of dancing, eating and drinking for one last hoo rah. It was going to be at the new house, Dean had spent the whole day outside getting the pool ready. Meanwhile Gabe was actually in some pain from the pregnancy and was showing as if in the second trimester. Sam and Cas were baking the pie while Gabe was relaxing on the couch watching The Walking Dead, Sam hollered from in the kitchen “You know I’ve fought actual zombies and they’re nothing like that.” “So what? That’s not why I watch it. Honestly I’m just waiting on Carol and Daryl to get together already, the zombie killing is a bonus.” “Okay baby whatever you say. Do you want something to drink?” “Water is fine, Eliza is not liking my caffeine addiction so I’m cutting back.” “Gabriel I can’t tell you how thankful Dean and I are for what you’re doing for us. I know Eliza is going to love her Uncle Sally.” “Actually I’ve been thinking of being called Aunt Gabriel but whichever Liz likes will be fine.” “Liz? She isn’t even born yet baby and you’re already giving her nicknames.” “So what? Liz is no good? How about Lizzy?” “I like Lizzy” Dean said as he came into the kitchen bringing the burgers. “We’re all set. Tell the guests the parties started.” “It’s only us Dean?” “Don’t count your luck too soon boys.” Crowley walked into the room setting down a giant wrapped box. “Hello Crowley.” Cas and Crowley had actually grown to be friends, kind of. “Hey wings. Where’s squirrel and moose?” “Sam is right here. Crowley when are you going to stop calling me moose?” “When you stop looking dumb founded all of the time.” “Crowley! Big fan. I haven’t had the pleasure of meeting you just yet.” “You must be Gabriel, it’s nice to finally meet you too. So how’d you end up with Moosey here?” “Long story, we’ll talk later. What’s in the box?” “Something for Dean.” “For me? This is a baby shower man not a birthday party.” “Just bloody open it.” Walking over to the box cautiously he motions for Sam to come with him. Gabe steps back chuckling already knowing what’s in the box. After tearing the paper and pushing the box a bit a body flops out. “What the hell Crowley?” “It’s a demon you idiot. It’s the last of them in this area. I told them that this and 100 miles out are off limits. As well as the whole Winchester family. You’re officially under my protection. This here is for the little squirrel.” “Oh.” Looking closely at the body he realizes that the person is not dead just unconscious. “There still alive?” “Duh, I just sent the demon back to hell.” “Good, you really have gone Jedi haven’t you?” “Guess so. I thought there would be drinks? You do have my liquor don’t you?”  “We have scotch if that’s what you mean.” Gabe touched the man’s forehead sending him back to wherever he came from with a new memory. “Thank you man, I think this is the start of a beautiful friendship.” Cas picked up the mess from the gift and threw it away, “Everything’s all set, drinks are over there, burgers are on the table, and gifts are being put anywhere apparently.” “Come on wings I thought we were bonding?” “We have, but I generally get upset when people make a mess on my new floor.” “Oh sorry love, I didn’t know.” “Well let’s stop yammering and start this party eh?” “I’m game, here.” Gabe handed Dean a wrapped box that was small. “I know I said Eliza was your gift but I lied. So here you go.” Inside the box was a set of baby monitors that were top of the line with video streaming. “It’s already set up, thought it would come in handy.” “Thanks Gabriel we love it.” “Love it? It’s freaking awesome. I never would have dreamt of having anything like this.” “Okay mine next. This is actually not for the baby it’s for Cas because I’m tired of seeing him in my brother’s old wardrobe.” Upon opening the package he beamed inside was a blue plaid button up shirt. “Thank Sam, I like wearing your brothers clothes though.” “I like it too.” “That’s why I bought it. Every time you come out wearing one of his sweaters or t-shirts your PDA level shoots through the roof and well we all decided that for Eliza’s sake you better get your own clothes because frankly it’s disgusting.” “You two are disgusting with your hickies everywhere. I mean come on. Yesterday I saw one on Gabe’s leg. His leg. So can it.” “You guys really are the Brady Bunch aren’t you?” “Shut up Crowley.” They all said simultaneously. He smirked and held up his hands, “Sorry. Just making conversation.” “I’ll wear it Sam, I do like it, but I also like wearing your brother’s clothes.” He looked at Dean and smiled, they stared at each other for a good five minutes before everyone else began to clear their throats. “See?” “I don’t know what you’re talking about Sammy.” Finishing opening up the presents they ate the burgers and pie. When they were done they moved outside by the pool. Sam and Gabe left before the others began to drink, Gabe couldn’t because of the pregnancy so Sam was being supportive. Dean asked if he wanted the rest to do the same but Gabe said not to because it would be the last time they would get to. Crowley was barely wasted but Dean was getting tipsy and he was getting tired of holding him up in the pool so he wouldn’t drown. “Cas babe, I’m a big boy I can swim on my own you know.” “Dean you’re very intoxicated.” “Shhhhh. Crowley is here, we’ll talk about pool sex later.” “How touching. And not in the sexy way. I don’t know what Moose was complaining about you two barely even touch compared to them two.” “Gabriel has always been very promiscuous. It didn’t take Sam for him to be that way.” Now Dean was moving his hips and slurring “Promiscuous girl wherever you are,” “Oh look at squirrel go. He always put on this good of a show for guests?” “No, and I think maybe you should go. He’s very intoxicated and he’ll be embarrassed tomorrow.” “Not one to mince words are you wings?” “Sorry if I was blunt.” “No need. Cheers.” In an instant Crowley was gone and Dean was still singing off key to the song again. “My milkshake brings all the boys to the yard and their like I raised you from hell and their like I raised you from hell. Na Na Na. The angels are waiting.” This was very humorous but he was tired from holding him up so he pulled on the hunter to get up. “Come on honey, let’s get you to bed.” “Oh no, I’m already taken by an angel. And he would be so pissed if I went home with you blue eyes. Hey. Those are the same color as Cas’s.” “I am Cas.” “Whoa. You sound like himm too. Are you a shifter-r?” “No Dean, I’m Castiel. You know me.” “Oh of course I do. You’re my baby daddy. Come mere.” When Dean was drunk his hint of a southern accent came out and he enjoyed it. Sloppily and very wetly he pulled the angels face to meet his own, his mouth was slippery and tasted like whiskey. He did not like the taste at all, pulling away he picked Dean up. “Hey there buddy I said I have somebody waiting for me at home.” “Yes, I know, I am that somebody. Come on unless you want to sleep out here.” “I want to do allll sorts of things out here, but Cas said no.” He laughed he told Dean no to the pool sex because it was outside and they had neighbors now. “Well maybe he is uncomfortable with having sex outside.” “That is soo not true. We fucked in the impala once.” “It was in the middle of nowhere. And I more grace left then.” “How do you-u know?” Finally the hunter passed out in his arms, thankfully they were in the shallow end of the pool. Picking him up, he carried him to their new bathroom. “Let’s get you out of those we clothes.” Slowly peeling off the wet clothes as to not wake him up he gently put the man on the floor. “I’ll be right back honey, I’m just going to get your clothes.” Looking for his pajamas he opened their dresser drawers, pulling out the familiar plaid clothing. When he returned to the bathroom Dean was hurling into the toilet. “Oh sweetie. I’m sorry, I shouldn’t have let you drink so much.” The only response he was given is a hurl into the toilet. Grabbing a wash cloth and wetting it. He lifted Dean’s face out of the bowl and cleaned his face up before giving him some water. The man smelled of puke and alcohol, “Ugh honey you reek. You’ll be so upset with me if I put you to bed in our new room smelling like this. Come on let’s get you cleaned up.” After cleaning his hunter up he toweled of his hair and put the pajamas on him. Finally getting into their new bed he smiled at his hunter, even though Dean was intoxicated and threw up half the night there was no other place he wanted to be. “Babe, will you sing me our song?” “Yes.” “Wise men say only fools rush in, but I can’t help falling in love with you. Shall I stay? Would it be a sin? If I can’t help falling in love with you. Like a river flows surely to the sea, darling so it goes, some things are meant to be…” When the song was over Dean was snoring happily against his chest. Soon enough he would be asleep himself.
“But you’re not opposed to it. So… flowers and chocolates and living together and killing God and maybe making out in the backseat of Baby? Is that what you’re trying to say, Cas? Is that what you thought you couldn’t have?”
When he emerged fifteen minutes later, the soot washed down the drain and the tension in his muscles eased by the hot water, it was to the sight of his two favorite people winding down after yet another dangerous job. Sam was still in the armchair, listening to some awful contemporary music without headphones and idly surfing the web. Dean felt a warm smile spread across his face at the familiar sight. But it was Castiel’s position that made Dean’s entire body flood with happiness.
“You’re so wrong about what makes up happiness. Having is a huge part of it. Having this with you- it’s the greatest thing I could ever imagine.”
Move, move, oh, come on now
Castiel had seen him facing certain death sounding less nervous than he did in that moment. He smiled and turned his wrist so that he and Dean were properly holding hands. “Yes, Dean. This is okay.”
Bobby sighed. “You don’t need to say it, Dean. Look, there’s a lot of reasons I offered to let you two boys stay with me when you were kids. But this thing that you can’t say? That was a big one.”
“Hey Cas?”
“No, I just feel… it’s different. I’ll get used to it. Everything is much quieter and duller, but also more intense. I’ll be fine. I’m sorry I won’t be any help against Chuck, though.”
Dean felt his heart sink. He was sure he knew where this was going, but he found himself asking anyway. “What did he want to do?”
“Why does this sound like a goodbye?”
Dean’s head snapped up. Castiel stood by the closed door, as far from Dean as he could be in the small bedroom, but still so close. Seconds away. Not in a different dimension. Not trapped away in Angel Death. Not sacrificing himself. Not crying.
Castiel stood motionless as two unstoppable forces battled for him. At his back, he could feel the Empty, the cold black goop soaking into his hair, wrapping around his legs, pressing into every part of him it could reach.
Dean scrambled off of the floor and launched himself at Castiel.
“From rebar,” Dean interrupted, still feeling annoyed that he’d almost been taken out on such a dumb run-of-the-mill hunt after surviving God less than two months before.
“Hey Cas?” Dean swallowed hard. Obviously he was trying to be calm for Castiel’s sake, but Castiel could see how terribly uncomfortable he was. “You said a lot of crazy shit back there to summon the Empty.”
Castiel looked at him sadly. “I heard that too. You do, Dean. Don’t you remember anything I say to you? You deserve to be saved. From Hell. From Billie.”
“You can’t have him,” Dean growled. “He’s staying right here. I ain’t letting go, so if you want him, you take me too, and then I’ll kill you from the inside out.” The Empty surged even tighter around Castiel, as if rebuking Dean.
And so Castiel explained as Dean tried to salvage the bacon. When he was finished, Sam stared at them both for a long moment before asking, “You mean you seriously didn’t know? Neither of you? For twelve years?” He then dissolved into a giggle fit so uncontrollable that Dean simply walked out of the room.
“No, of course not, Cas. I would never do that. And since when? I don’t know, man. Always? I guess one of the first times I really registered it in my brain was when I went on my first date with a girl- remember Cassie?- And I kissed her and when I went home that night, I just wondered what it would be like if I kissed you.”
Hey, play that song
I stayed an hour late at work yesterday so posting this got a little delayed. Sorry!
The one that makes me think of me
“Why?” If Dean could talk about why he had to move, maybe Castiel could too, and maybe it wouldn’t be as bad as his mother said.
When you gonna play that song and make my day
Finally, he choked out four words, so much harder to utter than the long speech he’d given a few hours before. “I want to stay.”
And of course he wasn’t blushing.
That's all you gotta do
Dean knew he should feel relieved at that, but he felt mostly confused. “Why, Cas? Don’t you miss being an Angel?”
He hung up and looked at Cas. Cas who was here, Cas who was human, Cas who… loved him? For one terrible moment, he thought of what would have happened if he hadn’t managed to stop the Empty. If he had gotten that call from Sam while still sitting in the dungeon, staring at the spot where Cas had been and wondering how everything had gone so wrong.
Dean grinned at that, the brilliant joyful smile that Castiel had seen less and less frequently over the years. “Awesome. Yeah, Cas, we can definitely make that happen.”
What they were doing could barely be called dancing. The space was too small and Castiel had absolutely no rhythm. But Dean swayed them back and forth to the music, even managing to twirl Castiel in a very clumsy move that resulted in both of their toes getting stepped on. When the song ended, Dean let go of Castiel immediately and flopped back onto his bed. Castiel remained standing on their impromptu dance floor, looking even more confused than he had before. He opened his mouth, clearly about to ask for further explanation, when Dean cut him off.
Somehow this was much harder to say knowing that he wasn’t going to be immediately swept away by a cosmic entity. “A very long time ago, when I was still learning so many things, I believe I referred to you and I as having a profound bond.”
“I wish you could see yourself the way I see you,” Castiel stated, daring a glance at Dean. He looked devastated. “Or the way everyone else sees you, so you know it’s not just a clueless fallen Angel with a bad grasp on humanity. I wish you could see yourself the way Sam sees you. The way Jack sees you-”
Dean sighed and followed. He changed out of his blood soaked clothes. He took Miracle for a short walk. He made them both a snack when they got back from it. (Yes, Sam, he’s eating off the plate. All the road stops and sketchy diners they’d eaten in their whole lives and they were fine. They could handle a dog licking a plate that was going to go through a dishwasher anyway.) Desperate for something to keep him occupied, he went out to the garage and popped Baby’s trunk. He cleaned every weapon they’d used that day. Then all the others. Then checked on the stock level of all the supplies. Finally, he retreated to his room, admitting that he’d run out of ways to avoid sitting in silence with his own mind.
“You said that was a dumb favorite food to have.”
“I didn’t know you felt that way. Or that you could feel that way. You’re a freaking Angel of the Lord, Cas. And I’m just- you used to call me the Righteous Man. But I’m not that. I’m not God’s plans. We all sacrificed a lot to prove that. I’m just-“
Once again, Dean would be left alone, grappling with Castiel being trapped in another dimension. Once again, Dean would blame himself for not holding on tightly enough. And it would be even worse this time, as the catalyst for the Empty’s attack had been Castiel’s confession of what he felt for Dean. Of course Dean would blame himself, as he blamed himself for so many things that were most certainly not his fault.
Castiel tried not to show his panic, but he was sure Jack could feel it. Jack could feel everything. “You have to help him.”
And then he kissed him very soundly, so Dean thought maybe he could forgive the laughing.
“We don’t. Cas, this is his home, just like it’s yours. We want him home more than anything. But-” he hated himself for saying it but he had to, “but you could stay here with him and be an Angel too. Would you want that?”
Dean swallowed hard at that, clutching at Castiel’s hand just a bit tighter. “I just want to make you happy, Cas. Happy that doesn’t get you sucked into Hell. Just… happy.”
The one the makes her stay out till dawn
*********************************************************************
Castiel looked up. His expression was wary, but at least he was looking at Dean. “When I was human before. Yes, I remember.”
Dean didn’t even smile at the comment. He just looked wary. “So you mean like… love. Chocolates and roses and shit.”
“How could you think that?” Dean whispered. But he knew exactly how. In that moment, he remembered every moment he had failed Cas, pushed him away, made him feel unloved. “Castiel, you are family and we will always want you here. I will always look for a way to bring you back.”
“What do you mean?” Not that Dean thought playing dumb was going to deter Sam. But gods, he did not want to talk about this. He didn’t even know how to talk about this.
“You wanna hear the crazy thing, though?” Dean continued. His tone was wistful and sad, which was confusing, but Castiel decided he preferred it over the anger he was expecting. “Sammy didn’t even know what he did wrong. I hauled him into Benny’s bedroom to chew him out and he was so confused. Didn’t know why you’d left or why I was upset. Apparently he thought we were together.” Castiel felt a sick, cold wave wash over him, but Dean just chuckled ruefully and kept talking. “Thought that I was just doing the whole never talking about my feelings thing, or that I was afraid Naomi might find out if we were too open about it. So he was really just trying to ask his brother’s boyfriend some dumb sappy question to make us both blush.”
“Cas, for the hundredth time, you ain’t here to benefit us. Look, man, everyone we know is laughing at us for taking twelve years to figure out we were both crazy about each other. I think we’ve gotta stop assuming what it is we think we can’t have. What do you want?”
“I don’t know what to say to him,” Dean confessed.
“It isn’t selfish,” Castiel assured him. “And I wish you would think of yourself first more often.”
The one the makes me stay out till dawn
The space between them was so small. Dean reached out and grabbed the Angel, pulled him close against him. He still didn’t speak and he knew he was being unfair, but all he could do was hold this magnificent being to him as tightly as possible. Castiel was still at first, then slowly, hesitantly, he returned the embrace. Dean hated himself all over again for that hesitancy, for making Cas feel anything other than a sense of home from him. “I’m so glad you’re safe,” he finally managed.
Dean was about to launch into an explanation of why Sam's contemporary music should never be played, regardless of circumstances, and to lament that his greatest failing in raising his baby brother was that he hadn't been able to teach him good music, but he was interrupted by Castiel.
“Wait, what?” Castiel asked ineloquently, suddenly feeling utterly lost.
“Dean, what’s wrong?”
My girl just heard this song and you should play it 'cause she loves it
“Castiel is here?” Sam asked excitedly. He glanced skyward, as though he expected their holy tax accountant to flutter down on big sparkly wings.
“He offered to rebuild my grace. It would be different than before, and something that the Empty would have no claim on. I could be an Angel again.”
For a brief moment, Dean got lost in a twenty five year old memory of his father moving them to a new town because he “didn’t like the look” of Dean’s new friend. A twenty three year old memory of John angrily explaining to Dean that he shouldn’t be so physically affectionate with his male friends. A twenty year old memory of John appearing out of nowhere and beating the hell out of some guy in a bar for buying Dean a drink. Dean hadn’t known his father was watching and had been flattered and excited just minutes before.
Sam worked so hard to not be John, and it hurts somewhere deep to know that sometimes when Dean looks at him all he sees is their father’s eyes.
Sam and her still share a bed, but they’ve started to divide down the middle when they sleep, just like they have when they’re awake. That night, she clings to him and doesn’t sleep a wink, and as soon as he starts to stir she rolls away and squeezes her eyes shut.
He pulls up on a motorcycle because of course he does, and he leans over the handles and looks her up and down like she isn’t illegal in all 50 states and he isn’t twice her age.
“Maybe God just thinks you’re worth saving.”
He says it so quickly that Dean can’t understand, but he doesn’t want to ask his dad to repeat it. Next to him, Sam is laying down on their shared bed working on homework. He sees the look on Dean’s face and mutters, so quiet that John can’t hear, “Pss-ah-lee-tay.”
“Stomach flu?” Sam tries to lighten the mood. “Or is the garbage you eat finally getting to you?”
“Something Dean told me once.”
“Hey, kid,” Bobby calls when she starts up the stairs. She stops and turns around, trying not to roll her eyes at the “kid.” Like she’s ever been a kid.
“He’s dead.”
He smiles, more bitter than Dean has ever seen him. “Dean, I had never been without a General. Not in my entire existence, which is bigger and more undefined than your human brain can even try to conceptualize without bleeding profusely.”
He wants to shower before they even start, but when the solid weight rests above him, Dean smiles, knowing that there’s at least one thing he’s good at.
She takes a pen from Sam’s bag and writes on her forearm in thick, heavy letters, “EVERYTHING WAS BEAUTIFUL AND NOTHING HURT.”
The nurse nods, glancing over her chart. “Well, that we can do for you.” She smiles. “How late is your period?”
When she stumbles into the room, her dad is still gone and Sam is asleep, his school books scattered around him. She quietly shuts the door, dropping her shoes, and pads over to their bed, collecting Sam’s things to tuck into his backpack. She knows his meticulous organization system and follows it perfectly. Once she’s done with her sisterhenning that long ago turned to motherhenning, she glances into the mirror hung up on the far wall above the TV. Her makeup is tearproof—not a track of sadness on her face. She wishes her mascara was bleeding down her cheeks. She wishes she could look as destroyed as she feels.
“It’s Dean,” she says to Erin herself, standing in front of her in the girls’ locker room.
“You got nothing to prove to no one, Dean.”
Sam hates watching Castiel eat. He doesn’t do it often, but every time it drives Sam up the diner wall. Angels do not eat, they do not drink, and they do not watch daytime television. When Dean says that Cas is being punished in Heaven for having his priorities out of whack, Sam is almost relieved.
“But that doesn’t mean that sometimes… you need people who have been through what you have. I mean, it’s why you like it when you’re invited to hunter gatherings, isn’t it? Because there are people like you?”
Bobby nods. “That’s true. It starts as HIV, which sometimes people can live with. And then it develops into AIDS. And AIDS… you can’t live with AIDS. You just don’t.”
“What?” Sam demanded.
Sam doesn’t wake up screaming anymore. He still gets nightmares, of course—he’s lived a constant cycle of them for how many years now?—but he wakes up with a silent jolt and can take in his surroundings quickly. Tonight it’s the Bunker’s library; he’d fallen asleep reading lore. He stands up and cracks every joint in his body because chairs are significantly worse than motel beds when it comes to his back, and begins to close the books around him.
“Whatever.”
Dean thinks in her head, but that’s rude because Bobby is taking care of them while her dad runs away and plays a psychotic game of house with their mother’s ghost. So out loud, she says, “Thanks for the food, ma’am.”
All she can think is,
“It is.”
“The reason I followed orders so well was because I knew nothing else. There was no choice. No free will. I followed
Dean looks up, wondering how long he would crave the approval of a dead man.
“Okay, fine. You know why I didn’t tell you about Ruby and how we’re hunting down Lillith?” Sam asks, low and careful and rational. “Because you’re too weak to go after her, Dean. You’re holding me back. I’m a better hunter than you are. Stronger. Smarter. I can take out demons you’re afraid to go near.”
“Tree,” he says, pointing, and Dean laughs so hard he has to pull over. Sam grinds his teeth because he really doesn’t want to be the kind of man who laughs at angels.
“Last time I checked,” Dean says.
The action seems to settle some of Dean’s tension, and he sits down at the end of the bed, still keeping his distance from Sam.
“I never had a husband.”
Bobby hands her a wrench. “Well, if you’re puttin’ shit together…”
Dean waves him off and tries to stand, his legs shaking and his hand holding the crackers while he readjusts clearly about to give. Cas stands immediately to help him, and Sam reaches out an arm, but he flinches away from both of them. Cas withdraws immediately, but Sam keeps going.
Dean probably shouldn’t have been so relieved when he came out of Hell with a new body. A new, untouched body. The scars weren’t what mattered to him—it was the old fingerprints that had been wiped clean. He watched the woman walk away and smiled to himself and said, “Man, it is time to right some wrongs.”
Dean swallows thickly. “I know why.”
He isn’t.
Later, while Sam sleeps and Dean drives through the shaking of his hands, he wonders if Sam’s been waiting to say that since Stanford.
“You’re agitated,” Cas says like it’s anything new.
“I have been rehymenated.”
Dean waits a few minutes before risking a glance out of the corner of his eye, and he finds himself being watched intently. Both of them flick their gazes around the room, making sure they don’t attract attention. Dean shifts pointedly, lifting his foot up a rung on the bar stool to spread his knees apart. The man stands, wandering his way over like it’s not intentional.
Cas murmurs against Dean’s cheek, “I wish we had a bed for this. A room.”
“About when I was younger. And… sex. And whatever.”
When her dad sits her in the backseat without a carseat, she knows this is good and right because she can watch out for Sammy. And when she gets promoted to the front seat and reads directions and passes the snacks out, she knows this is good and right because that’s what moms on TV do.
“Meet me in the back,” Cas growls before disappearing and that, at least, is familiar to the hunters. He and Sam rush out, coming up on Cas as he mutters words that are incomprehensible to Dean.
“You really think so?”
The first thing Dean thinks when she sees Castiel is,
He swallows and keeps every reaction from his voice. “The girls who played... you and Cas?”
And several clunky sentences spread out over an hour and half later, he does. How he got fucked for the first time at the age of thirteen and was able to buy Sam his first proper Christmas present. How even when he got older, his baby face kept guys coming. How if he said “no,” they’d pay him extra and he wasn’t even performing, he just got tips for voicing his own fear and sickness. How it actually was possible to get hard while crying. How even now he still can’t get pushed up against a wall or get on his knees and have someone on top of him without vomiting.
Bobby’s weird, Dean decides. Because first of all, her name is Bobby. And sure, Dean’s got a boy’s name, but that’s because she’s a tryhard who hasn’t figured out how to make her father happy or if he ever even gets happy at all. Bobby, she’s a grown adult who has a real name—Rebecca—that somehow over the decades got whittled down to Bobby and she kept it. And even worse, she cut off all her hair and doesn’t believe in shaving or eyeshadow.
Bobby tenses, but she doesn’t lean away or close off. “No.”
Surreally, the thing she hates the most about all of this is that the lines were pink.
There was nothing left to rearrange in front of him, and Dean wishes they were having this conversation outside so he could work on a car. He misses his hands when they aren’t doing something.
“Dean. You have been overly affectionate towards me this morning,” Cas states with his brows pulled tight. Embarrassed, Dean pulls his socked foot back from where he’d been teasing Cas’s ankle with it.
He takes the pamphlet.
“So I won’t believe in God when I grow up?”
“Sam, I have to tell you something. And you have to understand that I’m never gonna tell you all of it. And I don’t know if I’ll ever use the right words for it, or even be able to say it clearer than I’m going to. It’s just… it’s not who I am. But I trust you. So I want to tell you this.”
Dean watches him, trying to understand what he means. He takes the soup, but doesn’t eat it yet.
“—You can just say I can’t blow you—”
“Well, slowly but surely, everyone in this town is falling prey to Famine, but so far, you seem unaffected.”
“That’s not for me to say.”
Dean is so angry when they leave the rehearsal, feet-stomping, door-slamming, Sam’s-shocked-he-doesn’t-say-fag angry. John-angry.
“Yeah.”
“That’s not what I…” Sam runs a hand through his hair. “You’re a soldier of Heaven. You raised my brother out of Hell. You’re just… you’re not supposed to like milkshakes or whatever.”
“It’s a rookie mistake,” Dean said before he could think to stop himself, and Sam’s open mouth slammed shut like a door closed by a drunk. Dean’s knuckles whitened on the steering wheel.
“Of course I am!” he snaps. “Of course I am.”
Dean thinks.
Cas doesn’t go shopping with them again.
“I called you the d-word. Like, the d-y-k-e word. Behind your back. A lot.” She wipes a hand at her eyes aggressively, shame heavy on her bones. “Which was fucked up. Because you don’t deserve that. You are the kindest person I’ve ever known. And I want to apologize for what I did. And I want to thank you for making me better.”
Dean wouldn’t have had enough teeth left to apologize if he had said something like that.
Sometimes the bunker feels like a relief. No rent to pay, no boundaries to cross, a guaranteed roof over their heads every day.
They’re both bleeding from the necks, and there’s no better time for honesty that’ll taste bad in the morning. Dean spits out that he can’t trust Sam anymore, that he’s scared they aren’t family, that Hell has buried itself so far into Dean that it’s seeping into Sam and he can’t stand to watch it. He growls it, feels it torn from his chest under the layers he’s been burying it under.
“Something you wanna talk about?” Bobby asks. He always does, and Dean always shakes his head, lowering his eyes and tugging at his ear, trying desperately to give away his tells. He can bluff like a pro, but all he wants is for Bobby to sit him down and demand answers. He wants to be ordered to tell the truth because if he's just following orders, then he can’t be blamed for the aftermath.
“He’s just Cas,” Dean had shrugged when she’d asked about his powers. “I mean, he’s got his grace back and all, but he’s not some kind of winged douchebag like the rest of them.”
The day her father dies she walks into the women’s bathroom numbly, Sammy’s backpack in her hands. She hasn’t cried yet. She doesn’t know if she’ll ever cry again. She stands in front of the mirror and thinks about secrets, and she half expects her eyes to bleed from the weight of her father’s last words to her, but they don’t. She’s out of blood to give.
It’s not like he’s jealous. He’s not even into guys, let alone culturally incompetant guys with no idea how to dress or talk to people. But sometimes he remembers that at the end of the day, his brother lays down with an angel and he lays down in a demon’s bloody sheets, and it makes him feel ashamed.
Dean plays with her jeans, sitting cross-legged at the kitchen table while Bobby serves three cups of hot chocolate. She hands one to Dean, takes one upstairs to Sam, who’s reading up on his latest interest, American law, and then comes back down to sit next to Dean with her own cup.
He hesitates before saying, “That’s not true, Cas.”
“I want you. I’m famished.”
“Because I didn’t read the Bible,” he finally sighs. “Not all of it at least.”
Even on the blank screen, she can still see Logan Shepard’s face. She doesn’t think she’ll ever unsee Logan Shepard’s face. And she wonders what John would look like if he ever came home to news like that.
“Well you’re God’s righteous man and the angel’s best friend so shouldn’t
“Sam, I don’t care,” she rushes out, placing a hand on his shoulder. He leans in without thinking. She’s not sure he even notices his own reaction. “I wasn’t… you’re my boys. I love you both, and nothing could change that. I just… I just want you both happy. Castiel, does he make Dean happy?”
“I don’t know, how about when He
“Woah, slow down for a second. Why don’t you let me buy a razor? It won’t look like you hacked at it, at least.”
“This is so Puritanical,” the girl next to her mutters under her breath, and Dean rolls her eyes. Everything’s politics with girls like that. Sex isn’t about politics (well, not always). It’s about power. It’s about winning. The only problem with teaching girls their bodies are precious is some of them will really believe it and never get anywhere in life except a marriage bed.
She opens the book, folding the paperback cover in a way that left it curled and stressed Sam out to no end.
Dean Winchester looks out the cracked motel window, hearing the third member of his family rumble into the parking lot in a black Impala he dreams of one day driving. Sitting behind the steering wheel is his father, holding a quarter bottle of whiskey in one hand. Dean knows his father drives drunk sometimes, but he never complains because John doesn’t do it with Sammy in the car. That’s when it really counts.
Sam’s careful not to touch him again, but he cuts him off before he can try to run to his room. “Dean this is serious.”
“Didn’t know angels were allowed to do that. Think.”
He sets the bowl down on Baby’s roof.
“No,” Dean snaps without thinking, the hollowness sitting inside him growing at the thought of being away from his brother.
He understands devouring things you love. Not in such a grotesquely literal sense, but he knows what that ache feels like. Something tugs at his gut because no matter how many times he’s fantasized about taking someone into his arms and making them a part of him, he’s never wondered what it would be like to be consumed so fully before.
After she’s read three different books by Vonnegut, she decides to try something new. She stands on a kitchen chair, reaching for the highest shelves, and blindly picks the first book she can reach but can’t see. She pulls out a short, stubby book called
“Why didn’t he just come out here?”
“You can borrow anything you want,” Bobby tells him, and Sam decides that ten-years-old is the perfect time to read
she has Erin Walker’s tongue down her throat and Dean’s hands are shaking while they cling to her back.
“You smell nice,” Dean says over the sound of the music because she’s a fucking idiot.
Sam flicks his way through all of the ten channels available on the cheap motel TV, hoping that if he just keeps going some magic eleventh channel will appear to entertain him. He licks his fingers and hums, the grease of the fries still stuck in the creases. He’s so wrapped up in his life as a ten-year-old that he doesn’t notice that Dean has been in the bathroom for fourteen minutes.
“When I began questioning Heaven, I asked Anna for orders.” Dean doesn’t understand what Cas is saying, but he listens in the way that only the two of them can hear each other. “I needed them. Or believed I did. I’m not sure which. And she told me it was time to think for myself.”
“It tells you a lot about their childhood. I find it very informative,” he says as he takes a seat across from her. To be equals with an angel. It brings up questions about whether he’s lowered himself or if he was just never as far out of reach as she imagined.
Maybe he’s just used to it, Dean suspects. His tolerance for self-deprivation is unusually high, so maybe he just knows how to let his hunger fester.
Talk about gluttony. Talk about consumption. Talk about
Looking back down, she changes topics. “I’m reading John’s journal.”
As much as she likes to reassure her dad and Sam that memories of Mary still live inside her, there’s only so much a four-year-old can recall about her life in detail. There’s the fire, of course, the most vivid memory she has, the smell of smoke still able to bring it back with violent clarity. She remembers her mom’s hair, the way she’d leave it down so Dean could play with it. Sometimes when she wakes up, she can even hear her mom’s voice, a sound she had stopped begging to forget a long time ago.
“You think he’s disappointed in us?” Sam asks after Cas has been gone for almost seven full minutes.
Food is complicated for Dean. Although, it’s not food as much as it is hunger. He can appreciate a good hamburger for just being a hamburger, but starvation he has a more complicated relationship with. The feeling should be something that’s easier to condemn than it is, but it’s intermingled with nostalgia and memories of his father and the feeling of doing good by Sam. He loves food, but he misses missing it sometimes.
“It’s that almond shit you like,” he mutters, and he sets it down on the bedside table.
Sam pauses, shifting to face Dean. “What are you trying to get at?”
“Yeah, well. There was no direct translation for ‘motherfucker,’ so I made do.”
And later, happily and with a real smile on his face, Dean lays on his side and kisses him to sleep.
The first time they had kissed after Dean told Cas about his childhood, Cas had pulled Dean against him, pressing himself against the wall. He kept one hand on the back of Dean’s neck, rubbing soft circles, and Dean had slid his hands under Cas’s coat to wrap around his waist.
“He pulled me outta Hell. He left Heaven for us, Mom. He’s… he’s family.”
Dean wrapped Cas’s coat in his fists, trying to convince himself he could have this, trying to convince himself that maybe he didn’t have to tell Cas, he could just keep the two of them here forever, frozen.
John gives her a dirty look like she’s taken god’s name in vain before saying, “Yes.”
That’s what this anger is, Sam knows. The John that lives inside their heads. Sam’s calls him a monster, a freak. Sam is suspicious Dean’s does the same.
“You are uncomfortable around me. Why?” he asks Sam bluntly while Dean is in the bathroom. “I am uncomfortable around you because you have demonic powers and radiate something dark. You, however, were religious long before meeting me. What is the problem?”
and Dean wonders if everyone is really just defined by what pays the bills.
But Cas sits next to him, straight and stiff, and Dean knows he’ll listen, which is more than most do.
“Yeah, well, I’m a one-in-a-million kind of girl so could you please just run the test?”
Checking his phone he finds it's well past midnight and well before the normal time Dean manages to drag himself out of bed, which means he’s not cooking. And Cas doesn’t really sleep, but whenever he wanders at night he very rarely ends up in the kitchen. It’s all just molecules now. So Sam creeps his way to the kitchen door and finds—
“What do you mean?” Cas demands, his voice leaving a ringing in Dean’s ears despite how quietly he says it.
“Proof?” Dean demands.
Dean gets through the first two lines again, this time with no screw-ups. Sam looks at him the way Dad should: proud and just a little condescending. Sam has been looking down on Dean long before he was taller.
After 40 years of nothing but violence, it’s a relief to return to something as childishly simple as food.
Now, though, he had to make sure Castiel knew he meant it. “I love you, Cas. I always have.”
“Jack’s afraid of me,” Dean interrupted. “I’ve treated him like crap over and over again.”
What could Dean say to that? What could he possibly say to that? Castiel had just said things about him that he knew he could never deserve. And before that, he’d told Dean about some insane deal he’d made with the Empty that would take him away when he experienced true happiness? What the hell kind of fucked up deal was that?
By the following afternoon, Dean admitted defeat. He was never going to be able to come up with the perfect script of what to say. He was never going to be ready for this conversation. He needed to simply have it.
When Dean was healed, Castiel helped him sit up and then stepped away. Sam, who had finally stopped asking questions, rushed to his brother’s side. Dean looked up at the Angel standing before him, an inscrutable expression on his face. Or maybe Castiel was simply too afraid to try to interpret it. “Cas?” His tone was wary and unsure. What was the next part of his question? Castiel decided he didn’t want to find out. He had said all he needed to say to this brave, loving, beautiful person in front of him. And he had had a chance to save him yet again. That was how he wanted this to end, not with Dean asking him questions about why he’d said it- or scolding him for it.
“We’re fixing Heaven. Making it the way it should always have been. Jack’s doing a really wonderful job.”
Dean watched in horror as Castiel’s grace poured from his neck. The terrible black goo surrounding them lapped it up, slurping it away into nothingness. When the last drop was gone, it pulled back, releasing Castiel, who collapsed forward into Dean’s arms. It hovered just behind him and though it made no sound, Dean got the very distinct impression that it was… annoyed.
Castiel said, “I’m in love with you.” Apparently not done making a fool of himself, he added, “I want to stay forever.”
“Had no idea that we ever weren’t,” Castiel confirmed.
“Yes, that makes sense,” Jack said placidly.
“Cas, c’mon. Give me something. Please tell me you’re not mad.”
“You- You what? Since when? Dean, please don’t say this just because you feel sorry for me.”
Dean’s romantic escapades did, however, take away some of the pressure that Castiel was feeling at home. Naomi had been making suspicious comments for years about the apparent closeness between the two boys, their comfort with sharing physical closeness, and the way Castiel showed no obvious interest in girls. But with Dean dating half the girls in school, Naomi could simply write her son off as socially inept, which she clearly found frustrating but much less distasteful than him being gay. She seemed blissfully ignorant of the fact that Dean wasn’t exactly picky about gender.
———————————————-
This was stupid. Dean felt so stupid. His throat was burning and he was sure there were a few tears he hadn’t managed to blink back. He was so pathetic, asking an Angel for scraps of attention. An Angel who had saved his life just a few hours ago. How dare he ask him for anything else?
“Dean, I just spoke to Jack.”
“It isn’t typical for Angels to experience love in the way humans do. But I’ve never been a very good Angel.”
“Still doesn’t help us any, though,” Dean continued, voicing Castiel’s own bitter thoughts. “So I guess that’s that. No more dancing around it, huh?”
Sam answered casually, as if his prompt wasn’t earth-shattering, as if he hadn’t just stripped Castiel naked in front of everyone, as if the world would keep on turning after this moment. “When did you first know you were in love with Dean?”
Castiel tilted his head in that way that was so sweet and utterly breathtaking. He sighed. “Dean, I think we need to start being more direct, even if no one is dying. Do you want me to leave?”
“What’s up, sweetheart?” Dean asked, taking his hand. Because he could do that now. This would never get old.
“That seems… oddly succinct,” Castiel admitted. Suddenly, this entire conversation seemed much too complicated for that to be the conclusion.
be so hard. Dean could not let his own mountain of personal shit get in the way of making sure Cas knew that he was safe, that he was valued for much more than his worth in a fight against Chuck, that he belonged with them.
Sam found Eileen, his wife of forty one years, and settled in to spend the next forty one millennia with her. The Rainbow Bridge, he told Dean, wasn’t like the stories. All his former dogs hadn’t come running at him the moment he entered Heaven, but they eventually found their way to him.
They did indeed say their hellos to John and Mary. They checked in on Charlie. Sam found Jessica, spending eternity with her family. He told Dean that he’d apologized, but she had hugged him and told him it wasn’t his fault, and she was glad he’d been happy.
After a long moment, the black goo receded, apparently taking Billie and Castiel’s grace with it, and vanished.
(See the end of the chapter for
“Um…” Dean cleared his throat awkwardly. “But just… sorry, man, I just want to make sure I’m getting it right. You seemed like you were a pretty hard no when I asked if you meant, like, flowers and chocolates and shit.”
Beaming at Dean’s praise, Jack turned to Castiel. “Did you want me to make you an Angel first?”
“Wait for what?” Dean asked, not knowing what Bobby was talking about.
Then he shoved him, still smiling, pushing Dean away and onto the floor as that black goo surged towards him, clearly here to drag him away to a place where Dean could never reach.
The one that makes me go, ooh
Although Dean would never admit it to Sam, he didn’t hate the song. The melody was warm and the lyrics were gentle. Comforting. It was a song about finding home in the presence of another person, of being reminded of them by little things, and of wishing for small things that would make the person smile. The song told the story of Dean’s love of apple pies, or the way he sometimes smiled at strangers in tan trench coats.
Sam shifts at the disturbance of the room, but settles again quickly. Dean imagines it’s easy to sleep with a full stomach.
It’s a coward’s way out. Bobby never lets him take it.
“Regna terrae, cantate Deo, p… pas… paslate—”
“Why?”
“I don’t swing that way, kid,” she says, because she’s an asshole, and she watches Jo’s face crumple and she thinks that this is a cycle of some kind, a sick cycle where every woman hurts every woman, and Jo leaves and doesn’t talk to her for weeks.
Dean can’t recite Latin. He can read it just fine, but every time he tries to make his mouth fit around the dead language, he stutters. John hates him for it. Already Sam is better at this kind of stuff, and Dean’s the one who’s going out into the field.
She doesn’t have time to process what Dean’s words mean because she’s too caught up on her son mentioning he was in Hell like it's nothing. He gives her vague answers when she interrogates him, and she met enough of John’s war buddies to know a 1000-yard stare when she sees one. She doesn’t press. She doesn’t know how to get her son to open up to her when she isn’t even sure she has a claim to motherhood.
“You wear a ring.”
Erin rolls her eyes. “Don’t be such a prude.”
“Sam,” Dean coughs out, sitting up straight like their father called for attention.
Maybe it’s the “brother.” Castiel already misses being called that by holy beings.
The moment in the play ends, but Dean can’t bring himself to walk away from the stage. Sam’s got an itch to skip town now that they’ve decided to get on the road, but he waits as Dean struggles with all the things he wants to do and say and stop holding onto.
“Okay.” Cas nodded decisively, still processing what Dean was saying. “I’m not taking it.”
“What, Dean. What did you see?” Sam demands, weary and holding back tears, and that’s what does it. Sam’s look reminds him too much of their childhood.
“Dean.” The severity one Cas’s voice drew Dean’s eyes to his. “I am feeling a lot of things at the moment. Nearly blinding rage is one of them. Not at you,” he clarified when Dean flinched. “Never at you. At the people who did this to you. I hate them. You did not deserve it. You did
“Fuck,” she sighed, breathless and happy. “You're a goddamn pro.”
“From my understanding, you’ve gone an unhealthy amount of time without any food.”
“State wouldn’t let homosexuals adopt.”
While he rests his chin in Cas’s neck, he talks about Kansas like the angel doesn’t already know. Talks about Christmas and bedtime stories and the scent of cinnamon, and it turns into gasoline and the motors of the Impala and the way he had fed Sammy when they were kids.
When Cas looks up, Dean wants his eyes to be glowing. They’re not. The faint outline of wings, all four of them, fade against the wall, and Dean thinks that it’s not just the dark that’s making them hard to distinguish.
“Your daddy send you down? Finally ready to admit he needs help with that demon?”
“I don’t know,” Dean says honestly, confessionally.
A Winchester, she decides. She’s Deanna or Dean or Mary or Mother Mary or a dyke or a slut but she is always, always a Winchester.
And Deanna Winchester is not a prude, so she stands up with shaky legs and walks into the closet with Erin.
“...he didn’t care one way or the other, ‘so long’s I can get that lil ole gal with that lil sumpin down there tween her legs, boy,’ and ‘so long’s we can eat, son, y’ear me? I’m hungry, I’m starving, let’s eat right now!’ - and off we’d rush to eat, whereof, as saith Ecclesiastes, ‘It is your portion under the sun.’”
He doesn’t have to kill the angry part of him if he just starves it of attention.
Sam disappears up the stairs, and Dean doesn’t take his eyes off him until he has to.
“Hey, kid, you got nothing to be—”
Once, in front of a Halloween store in a hodunk town in Ohio, Castiel had stopped speaking in the middle of a lecture on holy wrath, his feet coming to a halt. He froze so suddenly that Dean bumped into his shoulder and grumbled about angels just not Getting It.
“Oh, so He just, what? Made us and left? Wanted to watch us on the big screen and ignore our problems?”
He picks up every pamphlet and looks at the official website even though he might as well not even be able to type when it comes to computers. He looks at pre-law requirements like they’re werewolf mythology or written in Latin and his dad’s looking over his shoulder. By the time Sam throws on a backpack and jumps ship like Dean’s always been afraid he would, always hoped he would, he wants to clap him on the shoulder. Sam’s gonna be a lawyer. Dad’s angry, but Dean’s proud. He’s proud and he’s happy and he’s not bitter, and he tells himself that through his bloody teeth in the mirror like a summoning ritual or an exorcism. Burning the envy right out of his chest. It’s not like he stayed four years after he’d been able to get the hell out of dodge. It’s not like he’d given up everything for this family. It’s not like he used to fantasize about supporting Sam without having to be on the road or at a poker table or in an alley.
She leans forward. “What do you mean?”
He knew that’s not actually how anatomy works—he did pass eighth grade health—but he’d always privately thought of it as popping his cherry. There had been a lot of blood, after all.
Dean curls in on himself a little tighter and turns the TV up. But he reaches for Cas’s hand and squeezes gently.
“After we track down yellow-eyes… Dean, I’m going back. This life isn’t mine.”
she asks instead.
“You have a right to know what you’re getting into,” he told Cas quietly. “I couldn’t… I couldn’t sleep with you and not… warn you.”
Both of them. Together. Sitting on the tile with a trash can in front of them, clearly full of vomit from what Sam can smell. Dean’s got a sleeve of Saltines on his legs and Cas is holding a glass of ice water and Dean’s face, red and puffy, is buried in Cas’s undershirt, which is all the angel is wearing. He clears his throat, startling the both of them.
“You’re the kind of person who does voices for all the characters, right? Accents and hand gestures?”
The cold tile underneath him is chipping away, and Dean tries to pry one up without thinking. He digs his nails in with all the power he has, which isn’t much these days, and yanks. It doesn’t come loose. The ugly pattern of the floor remains unchanged.
Before he can flag down the waiter, Cas shakes his head, carefully avoiding looking at Sam. “I’m good, Dean.”
Dean grits her teeth and nods, and the woman’s face drops just a little.
Sam swallows. He likes to think of himself as the most direct member of his family, but sometimes Castiel’s bluntness startles him. Picking up a menu to avoid looking at the angel, he says, “You’re supposed to be better than us, Cas.”
When Cas appears in front of him, it occurs to Dean that he hasn’t eaten all day. He shoves the thought aside, knowing thinking shit like that leads to bathroom stalls. He shows Cas the hearts, wishing he could recognize the man’s native tongue with a glance like Sam, wishing he’d had a chance to know things that weren’t about the aim of every gun his father owned, wishing he could just pull Cas close and devour him.
To John, Deanna is both the Madonna and the whore. It doesn’t matter what she does; she’s either her mother or her mother’s worst nightmare.
“Nope,” she says. “Do you?”
“No. I didn’t have the number.”
“I don’t know, I didn’t really see him.”
“Like the sexual addiction seminar you attended for the dragon case.”
“What, a guy can’t show a little interest in his partner?”
and everything that comes with them.
Turns out, Bobby was right. Dean is a reader. She’s been starving for it. She devours Bobby’s library like a child who knows what hunger is, savoring every word.
