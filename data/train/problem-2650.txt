“Sure,” Alice said, hopping off the stool with Jackie in her arms. She went to the front door and opened it. “Hi John, Hi Sherlock,” she said, grinning up at them.
“Do you want me to take care of you?” Greg asked after a moment.
“Yes, alright. Goodnight.”
“It’s not a ‘guessing thing’, it’s deductions,” Sherlock corrected sharply. “And it’s something me and my brother have always done. Best to know everything about a person before wasting time becoming acquainted and finding out they’re not worth your time.”
“I was going to look to the internet next,” Sherlock admitted.
John thought about how Sherlock going to the upstairs-bedroom-come-nursery gave a hint as to his headspace. If Sherlock was bypassing the usual dithering that came before he slipped into his little headspace, that meant he was already slipping down.
“Jumper or no jumper?” Greg called to Mycroft, who had retreated back into his bathroom.
“No wonder you never eat,” John grumbled.
“Successful?” Sherlock asked after they were securely in the back of their car.
“Whatever do you mean?” he asked, one eyebrow shooting up.
Liz looked hesitantly at Sherlock. “Papa?” she asked.
“I just have a few questions for Liz, and then we’ll figure out what will happen next. “
“Where’d you get the bruises?” Sherlock asked quietly, running his fingers gently down one on her arm.
“The tone of your voice implied that you were busy.”
“Yes, spanking,” John said. “You had your warning and chose not to heed it. Now you get a spanking. You know how it works, Sherlock.”
“I would enjoy that as well,” Sherlock said quietly, staring at his feet.
“No, that’s a hard limit.”
“A perfect angel. Slept through the night last night.” As if she could sense her father’s presence in the flat, a piercing wail broke through the room. “And there she is,” Mrs. Hudson said, turning towards the other room.
“Okay, okay, I’m done,” John chuckled, holding up his hands in surrender. “You can play for a few more minutes and then we’ll get you tucked into bed.”
“You do know I love you, right? So much.”
Sherlock found he could not lie. “I have been texting one,” he admitted. “We seem to be getting along. Only time will tell I suppose.”
John, already frustrated by Sherlock’s stubbornness, felt himself grow more irate. “No, that’s the whole point! I mean, they’ve tried to write that into the DNA, but we don’t know if they’ve succeeded. And even if they have, that’s basics. It still changes person to person. This is a way to make this more pleasurable for you, and to ensure both your and my safety, Sherlock. Take it seriously, for God’s sake!”
“Right. And you also mentioned our favourite place to go on dates?”
“Why does it matter to you?” Sara asked, voice rough.
“Oh, Sherlock,” John sighed, “when did this happen?”
They walked into a small, cozy waiting room with several cushy chairs gathered around a low table. There was a front desk with an elderly receptionist sitting behind it. She looked up when they entered, smiling gently.
“Sorry about that,” Greg said softly when she had left, not letting go of Mycroft’s hand. “Acting the part and all that.”
Liz just nodded, putting her face back against John’s neck and letting out a shaky breath.
“How much do you know about magic?” she asked, looking up to John when she got no answer.
Sherlock hummed unconvincedly, but didn’t say anything. Sherlock looked outside and realized they were sitting outside the flat. “How long have we been sitting here?”
“Because I feel I performed inadequately at my job today and, as a result, someone got permanently injured.”
Liz looked a little uncomfortable and a blush marred her cheeks as she ducked her head. Staring at her plate, she shoveled a forkful of eggs into her mouth.
“What are you doing here?” Greg blurted, brow furrowing as he laid eyes on Mycroft.
Rose scurried off to find robes and John followed after her, hoping to be led towards the children’s section. He passed by mannequins of all shapes and sizes wearing different robes. As he passed, the mannequins shifted into different poses.
“Very well. If you ever have any questions, please feel free to ask them.”
“For you and me both,” Mycroft responded softly, laying a gentle kiss on Greg’s head. “Would you like to tell me what happened?”
“Grip the bedrail, please,” he said, walking around to the foot of the bed. Sherlock followed, facing the bed and bending so that he was gripping the bedrail, slightly hunched over. “Good boy,” John soothed, running the flogger gently up and down Sherlock’s back. Sherlock took a moment to catalogue the feeling of the cool leather sliding against his skin, knowing it would be producing a very different sensation in a few moments.
“No moving,” Mycroft snapped, giving a sharp tug on the chain connecting the nipple clamps. Greg whimpered slightly, trying hard to stay still. The sandwich was offered once more to Greg, who took a reluctant bite and chewed quickly.
“Really, so you don’t think your mental and emotional health are important? Is that what you’re saying?”
“John, I think my nose is broken.”
“What do you think you’re doing?” Greg asked, looking down to see it Jackie was awake. She was still blissfully asleep.
“So who has to clean up the rice?”
“You didn’t,” Sherlock lied, quickly wiping the two tear tracks on his face.
“I think you can this time,” John said with a dry tone and an arched brow.
Sherlock sighed. “Yes John.”
“Apparently you made an impression on her last night and, by extension, I did too.” Sherlock shrugged. “I have a sneaking suspicion ours is one of the few kindnesses she’s seen in her young life.”
“I’m not sure what those people want from me,” Mycroft admitted softly. “But I will be working non-stop with my people to figure it out.”
“I didn’t peg you for an incense kind of guy,” Greg said with a smile. “But no, I wouldn’t mind that kind of stuff. It’s more the stuff that will negatively affect me that I’m worried about.”
“I would hope not.” Greg paused for a moment. “And we’re… pretending to be a couple?”
“Well, I’m going to get going. It was nice to meet you, and to see her again. Remember, sleep and fluids. No getting out of that bed until Dr. Watson comes tomorrow morning. And probably not even after that. I’ve left some pain relievers on the bedside table for him.”
“Okay, serving as furniture. That could include me sitting on you, and me using you to put things on, like a table.”
When he re-entered the bedroom carrying two mugs, it was to the sight of Mycroft with Jackie sitting beside him, happily babbling at him while he answered her.
“Later, please.”
“Because I don’t see why it is important,” Sherlock cried, throwing his hands out above his head. “I trust you,” he continued, looking into John’s eyes. “You know what’s best, I’m sure. Plus, hasn’t it been written into your DNA to tell me what to do? What does it matter what I like and don’t?”
“Can we help you lads?” The man asked. He was in his late thirties, a receding hairline haloing the crown of his head. A bulbous nose stood out from wide, kind eyes buried under bushy brows.
“Yes.”
“Night.”
“I don’t have one.”
After John left, Liz shifted so that she was curled up on the opposite end of the sofa from Sherlock. He reached out and plucked John’s laptop from the coffee table, shifting it so that Liz wouldn’t be able to see it. He typed in “signs of child abuse” and started navigating through all the different websites.
“Ta,” John picked up his mug and took a sip, laying out the last needle and clapping his hands together. “Well, we may as well get this out of the way. She’s not going to be happy after these,” he warned Mycroft.
With that, Mycroft clicked off his phone, letting out a soft curse under his breath. “We’re going on another field trip,” Mycroft told Jackie as he texted his driver. He assembled a diaper bag, making sure he had a container of baby cereal and a divertissement for Jackie. Then he dressed her, slipping a tiny pair of jeans and a short sleeve shirt over her onesie. Taking out the papousse, he took a moment to figure out how it worked and strapped on and then got Jackie securely in it. Double checking that he had everything, Mycroft quickly exited, locked up his flat and rode the elevator to the first floor. Getting out, Mycroft exited through the lobby, nodding at the doorman on his way out and ducking into his waiting car.
“It’s a pleasure to meet you all. Shall we all sit down?” He motioned to the sofa and moved to sit in the chair facing it. The other three filed onto the sofa, John and Sherlock once more bracketing Liz.
“Liz, what do you say to Mycroft for bringing robes for you?”
John fought against the despair he felt for the thin pile of bones sitting beside him.
Liz shrugged.
“Happy Easter,” Greg greeted them. “What’d you bring for dessert?”
“Stop patronizing me,” Sherlock snapped, taking his hand back and restlessly scooping up his phone. John leaned back in his chair, visibly taken aback.
“Oh dear,” Mycroft sighed, pulling her out of the shopping cart and propping her on his hip, bouncing her gently as she continued to sob. “There, there,” he soothed. “We’re just going to have to borrow that for a second, my dear,” he continued, gently prying the teddy bear from Jackie’s fingers. She sobbed even harder, and the saleswoman quickly scanned the bear before handing it back to Mycroft. “Thank you.” He quickly pulled out his card and paid, bouncing Jackie continuously in his arms to no avail. “Come, Jackie, it’s okay.” Then, he remembered a trick that used to work on Sherlock when he was a baby. Digging in his pockets, Mycroft pulled out his house keys and dangled them in front of Jackie, getting them to jangle enticingly. Jackie’s sobs slowed as she focused on the keys in front of her. Reaching out, she grabbed onto the keys and tugged, sticking one into her mouth happily and dropping her bear in the process. As long as she was quiet and happy, Mycroft was happy as well. Picking up the dropped bear, he threw it in a bag. His driver approached just then, grabbing the assembled bags in both hands and walking towards the door. Mycroft followed, taking a content Jackie with him. He slid into the backseat, holding her once more on his lap. Although he had purchased a car seat, he was having it delivered along with the other big items. The drive was quiet, Mycroft occasionally jangling the keys in front of Jackie to keep her occupied. When they got in, Mycroft and the driver went up to his flat, and the driver dropped the bags in the sitting room.
“Oh, I know that,” Marcia said. She opened the bag that had been slung on her shoulder, pulling out bandages, a medical sewing kit and medical scissors. “Can you grab me a bowl of hot water?”
“So how does one use this?” Mycroft asked, brandishing the small bulb syringe.
Jackie said a quiet “ah” to Marcia, watching her with wide eyes. Greg noted that Marica had packed up her things and had tucked Mycroft under the covers, what remained of his tac suit thrown on top of the bed.
“Liz, is that your name?”
“Thank you,” John said, leading the way down the hall, Liz’s hand firmly in his.
“Now for the fun stuff,” he grinned at Jackie, who had been impressively silent throughout the first part of the shopping trip. “Let’s start at clothes.” He wheeled the cart to the baby clothing section. Frills, bright colours and frothy lace surrounded him. It was early enough in the morning that the children’s section was mostly empty, most parents at work or still at home with their young children. Mycroft headed to one of the racks and picked out onesies in a variety of plain colours, as well as various pairs of baby jeans and jumpers. He also picked out a Paddington Bear style raincoat.
“You did so well, Gregory,” Mycroft praised, pulling Greg upwards and grabbing his legs so that he was straddling Mycroft on the big plush chair, practically sitting in his lap. “Now, I want you to put your hands on my shoulders and don’t let go.” When Greg had done it, Mycroft leaned forward to whisper in his ear. “If you don’t let go, I’ll let you come.” He bit Greg’s earlobe as one hand reached for his nipple, the other one tripping down the corset and into his pants. Gripping Greg’s cock, Mycroft grabbed the hard length gently, teasing his hand up and down his length. “Do you think you could come like this?” Mycroft asked, sucking hard into the side of Greg’s neck as he gently brushed his hand once more up and down Greg’s shaft. “Just my fingers ghosting up and down your length, me biting and pinching you.” Mycroft sunk his teeth into the meat between Greg’s neck and shoulder, moving his hand from his nipple into his hair. “What if I pull on your hair? Will that tip you over the edge?” Mycroft suddenly grasped Greg’s length firmly, twisting his hand around the head of his cock and spreading the pre-cum he found there. “Or maybe you need it quick and rough, will that get you there? Hm?” He tugged relentlessly on Greg’s hair and cock, crushing their lips together and nipping at Greg’s lower lip. “Are you going to come for me?” Mycroft asked, nipping at Greg’s earlobe again. “Are you getting close? Look at all that pre-cum, you’re so wet for me Greg, you look so gorgeous coming apart on my lap for me, come on now, let go, you can do it.” Mycroft raked his finger nails back down from Greg’s scalp to his chest and scratched over his nipple. “Come for me, Gregory.” He jerked Greg relentlessly until with a cry he came, spilling into Mycroft’s hand. Mycroft worked him through his orgasm, sealing their lips and drinking Greg’s moans down. When he was finished, Greg rested his forehead against Mycroft’s shoulder, panting and sweaty. Mycroft wiped his hand on Greg’s pants, silently promising to wash them later.
“No, she did not build the crib,” Mycroft said, rolling his eyes. “And her name is Jackie.”
They quickly made their escape, exiting onto the street and hailing a cab. The realtor gave an address to the cabbie, and they were off, Mycroft and Greg in the back seat and the realtor in the front. When they arrived at their destination, Mycroft led the way to the front door, Greg falling next and the realtor bringing up the rear. When he reached the door, Mycroft stepped aside, letting the realtor pull out the key and unlock the door. She held the door open for both of them and Mycroft gave a polite nod of thanks.
“Ya!” she cried, grinning at Greg.
“Hello, Jackie,” Greg crooned at her, rubbing her stomach soothingly. It seemed to calm her somewhat and she let out a few more whimpers. “There you go,” he soothed. “You’re alright. Daddy will make it right as soon as he gets back.” Greg looked up and saw Mycroft in the door, looking equal parts despairing and relieved. “I’ve had ten years of practice,” Greg reassured him, looking back down at Jackie. “The first time Layla got her pokes, I thought I was the worst parent ever because I couldn’t make it better and I couldn’t protect her from the pain. And then I realized that it was normal and that I won’t be able to protect them from everything, no matter how hard I try.” Greg made eye contact with Mycroft once more and smiled gently. Mycroft felt his stomach flutter but pushed down the emotion.
“You know where to go?” Sherlock asked.
“You finally see how happy you make each other.”
“Here,” Sherlock offered one from his coat pocket.
“Because I’m on a case, John.”
“What happened?” Sherlock asked as he huffed behind John.
“Yeah, well Mycroft can shove it. When’s he due back anyway?” John called from the kitchen.
“I’m trying to get the Trace placed on her,” Hermione said, glancing up at them as they came in.
“Nope.”
“Hence your tense relationship.”
“Tea?” Sherlock asked hopefully.
“No, sir,” chorused around him and he nodded.
“I’ll wait until my people arrive to guard the house and then I’ll leave,” he said, turning into the driveway.
“Right,” he said, angrily picking up the supplies from the kit and slamming them into it. He snapped it shut and scooped it up, stomping into the bathroom. He blindly put the first aid kit away, too angry at Sherlock’s outburst to see what he was doing. As he was turning to exit the bathroom, he saw Sherlock standing there, blocking the doorway.
Watching Sherlock for a moment, John observed the tense lines in Sherlock’s shoulders and neck. He knew this case was stressing his boy out and he was determined to fix that. Heading back into the kitchen, John put their sandwiches in the fridge, knowing they’d keep for however long it took him to get Sherlock back in order. John made himself a tea, carefully watching the clock.
“If I promise not to harm them, will you tell me where the others are?”
“Hi, I believe we’re scheduled under the name Holmes?”
“It amazes me that my brother hasn’t figured out a way to fix that,” Sherlock said, frowning.
“Both.”
“Goodnight, my love,” John whispered, closing the book and replacing it on the shelf. “Sleep well.” He turned on the small moon nightlight plugged into the wall, turning off the overhead light. Before he left, he took one last look at his sweet boy, marveling at the fact that he was lucky enough to see this side of Sherlock.
Instead of making Mycroft feel better, that only seemed to make him feel worse. His face crumpled anew as he quietly started sobbing.
“On the contrary, I have every faith you will both be exactly what she needs. You’ll be able to show her that magic isn’t a bad thing, for one.”
“Hello, John,” Hermione greeted.
“No thanks,” Sherlock said, standing once more and moving to look out the window.
“Thank you for your honesty,” John said.
“And I’ll have a coke and the burger.” They handed their menus to the waitress.
“Okay, that’s fine. I’ll go get your pajamas, then.” Without saying anything else, Greg turned and moved into the bedroom, quickly getting Mycroft’s pajamas from the drawer dedicated to his things. They had been together for a few months, and were at the stage where they were staying at one flat or the other most nights. He took the pajamas out to Mycroft, who hadn’t moved from his place in front of the door.
“You’re very welcome,” Mycroft said. “Charlie, your turn.”
“Part-time. St. Mungo’s, the wizarding hospital, is attached to Bart’s. When I graduated, I went to Muggle University, but I also took Healer classes, sort of a combined program. It allows me to work at both Bart’s and Mungo’s. I end up splitting my shifts about 50/50.”
Sherlock shrugged. “It is important that John have a job, as he keeps reminding me.”
“You happy, then?”
“You were just protecting yourself,” John reassured her, voice tight. He was trying to remain calm through the red haze that had descended. “You are not bad. You are very, very good.”
“Must we? Clearly she’s not enjoying it.”
Liz took a shaky breath but nodded.
She obediently closed her eyes, falling into a deep sleep.
“Well, we’d best be off,” John said. “We’ll start looking into getting the flat fixed up today, Mrs. H.”
“Tease,” John chuckled quietly as he tightened his hand momentarily in Sherlock’s curls. Reaching for his mug of tea, he took a sip and made a face before offering the mug to Sherlock. Sherlock gratefully took a sip, glancing up at John.
“I just, I don’t. It’s stupid, alright? I just can’t make it shut up. I just, I just,” Greg was hyperventilating at this point, both hands digging into his scalp as he breathed sharply and tears coursing slowly down his cheeks.
“Paddington.”
John hesitated for a moment, looking over his shoulder. Liz was looking at him owlishly, hand woven in Sherlock’s sleeve but otherwise calm. Sherlock was sneering at the doorway.
“How was the date, brother?” Mycroft greeted when Sherlock made it inside.
“Did you already call NSPCC?”
“I’m going to get you to hold her on your lap,” John said, pulling another chair out for Mycroft beside the table. Mycroft took Jackie from Sherlock and sat her on his lap facing out. She gurgled happily, clapping her hands and grinning gummily at John. “We’ll keep her in her grow. We’ll be doing three jabs today, one in each arm and one in her leg.” John had slipped into his doctor voice. “I’m going to need you to hold her hands down. Wrap one arm around her and use the other to distract her?”
“And is she… permanently yours?” John asked delicately.
“Did you want to try and get her lying down?” He asked quietly.
“Why is it you walk in at the most inopportune moments?” Mycroft asked.
“And who hit the technician?”
“Yes, sir.” The car pulled away, leaving the two men and an alert baby to climb the front steps.
“And consequently protected me.”
“Wasn’t.”
“Make sure she sleeps,” Sherlock told Mycroft. Mycroft knew it was his brother’s way of showing his affection towards Jackie. They let themselves out while Mycroft moved into the bedroom, gently laying Jackie in the crib and pulling the light blanket over her. She went down without much of a fuss, falling readily into a deep sleep.
“Sure,” Alice said. Greg slid the bowl, tongs and pre-made salad towards Alice. Standing Jackie on her lap, Alice reached forward and opened the plastic salad container, dumping the contents into the bowl. Picking up the spoons, Alice dug them into the salad, Jackie leaning back so that Alice supported her and trying to grab the spoons as well. Alice brought the spoons closer to Jackie, dragging the bowl to the edge of the counter. Together they mixed the salad, Jackie giggling delightedly in Alice’s lap.
Greg squinted. “Ah, so one of those you-could-tell-me-but-you’d-have-to-kill-me positions, hey?” His grin stretched teasingly.
“John,” Sherlock gasped, finally breaking away for air. “What-?”
“What? No, of course not! John’s not around to help me on cases sometimes.” His brow furrowed. “You thought that John was being a neglectful partner?”
“As I said earlier, Mycroft will take care of it. He holds a position in the British Governments. All of them.”
“Why do you do that guessing thing whenever you meet people?” he said, finally looking at Sherlock straight on.
Mycroft was already texting on his phone. “We’ll Apparate a few streets away in an alley and follow her on foot from there.” Both he and Hermione stood, Hermione folding the map and slipping it in a pocket of her robes. Mycroft finished his text and put away his phone.
Mycroft felt ice wrapped around his heart. Usually he would drop everything without a second thought, but now he had Jackie to worry about.
“Mmm hmmm,” Greg agreed.
“You have five seconds to step away,” Sherlock said.
“Oh my god. Very well, we’ll take the dog in the police uniform as well.”
“Did you get to go outside much?”
“Abrasion, two.”
“Continue working on it as usual, but don’t be surprised if you’re told by higher-ups to drop it,” Sherlock answered.
“Yes, good idea.” He handed Jackie to Greg, who situated her in the car seat. Then, he took the proffered dog from Mycroft and tucked it in beside Jackie. “There we go, all snug,” he said. “Time to get groceries.” He and Mycroft got into the front and Mycroft drove the couple blocks to the grocery store. When they got out, Greg put the carrier on and Mycroft helped slide Jackie into it.
John took a moment to look over Sherlock before nodding. “Alright,” he agreed. “Into the bedroom with us, then.” John made sure the flat door was locked before he followed Sherlock into the bedroom. “Trousers and shirt off and into the hamper, please, but keep your pants on.”
“You sure you’re up for that?” John asked skeptically.
“It’s not whether it’s hard or not, it’s just the fact that we should both be contributing equally to this relationship.”
“Still doing alright, love?”
“I’ll see what I can do,” John left them to it, moving into the kitchen to the sound of Sherlock murmuring quietly to Liz. He waved his wand, summoning three mugs and spooning cocoa mix into them. He poured milk into all three mugs and waved his wand over them, bringing the mugs gently to a boil. He dropped three marshmallows into each mug. Then, he levitated the mugs and directed them into the sitting room. Liz eyed them warily when they floated into the room, but accepted the one that stopped directly in front of her.
“Alright, well I’m hungry, so let’s see what we can scrounge up.” Greg started moving into the house. “Kitchen is…?” He looked back at Mycroft. Silently, Mycroft pointed left. Greg followed his finger and wandered into a surprisingly modern kitchen.
“No John-“
All of the adults had calmed down and were calming down the rest of the children. The silence was almost worse, as it seemed as if everyone in the room was listening to them.
“Good,” John nodded.
“You’re not fine. Do you know how I know you’re not fine? Your EMT had to drag your unconscious body in here, and then I had to help her drag you to your bed. And then I had to watch her stitch up your gunshot wound. No hospitals? Jesus Mycroft, what if you had been seriously injured? What if you were on the edge of death, with me and Jackie waiting anxiously at home, and you refused to go to hospital?”
“That’s a good start,” John said as he re-entered the room carrying the first-aid kit and sat on the coffee table, facing Sherlock. “And you’re welcome. As we agreed, professional lives stay distinctly separate from our personal lives. Anything about your attitude?” John gently removed the tissue from Sherlock’s hand, placing it beside him on the coffee table. His nose had stopped bleeding.
“Okay,” she answered. “Chinese for dinner tonight?”
John didn’t like where this was going.
“We’ll be right there,” he said, hanging up. “We’ve got to go.” The two of them abandoned their coffee, sprinting out of the shop.
“Perhaps that’s enough for now,” Mycroft said after a moment, looking at the mountain of fabric now piled in their cart. Jackie just looked at him and clapped her hands, clueless to the hint of embarrassment Mycroft was feeling. Looking more sedately through the section, he picked out several packages of multi-coloured socks, some with lace, some with polka dots, and some that were plain. “That should last you for the rest of the summer, at least,” he decided, looking around. “And now, for toys.” He pushed the cart towards the toy section, hesitant as lights, colours, and sounds more overwhelming than a multi-national conference of world leaders surronded him.
“Sorry,” Liz whispered, looking away.
Liz nodded morosely.
“Why is that?” Evangeline prompted, directing it to Mycroft.
“Great, let me know if you need any help with getting Jackie ready.”
“How old are you?”
“Knifeplay. This one’s a hard limit for me, love, same as gunplay,” John said to Sherlock, who had ended up with his head back in John’s lap. “No particular reason, I just don’t like the idea.”
John was just getting lost in the advice columns when his reading was interrupted by a loud crash, followed by Sherlock yelling loudly. There was a deafening pop and John scrambled up, newspaper flung to the floor in his haste.
“No,” Sherlock pulled away, looking ridiculous with the big white ice pack pressed gingerly against his nose.
A sharp cry woke Mycroft as it pierced from the monitor in his hand. Jerking out of a deep sleep, Mycroft tossed the monitor onto the couch and hurried into Jackie’s room. It was still filled mostly with boxes, Jackie’s crib like an island in the middle of the room. Going quickly to the crib, Mycroft leaned in and picked up a crying Jackie under the armpits, tucking her to his chest and bouncing her up and down, shushing soothingly in her ear.
“What is it?” Sherlock asked gently.
Liz nodded, eyes downcast.
“Sherlock, don’t be mean,” Violet chided her son as she pecked him on the cheek. “We’ll see you next week.” Their father waved at them from behind their mother.
“You were so sexy today, first figuring out who did it and then running by my side to catch the murderer.” He dragged Sherlock towards him once more.
“Alright, dismissed.”
“Mmmm,” Greg hummed, letting his body sag into Mycroft’s knees. Greg continued dragging his hand through Greg’s hair, letting his other hand dig into the knots in Greg’s shoulders. Slowly Greg’s shoulders relaxed, and he started purring into the side of Mycroft’s knee. They sat like that for a couple minutes.
“Wait,” Mycroft breathed, looking to the side and narrowing his eyes at a pair of dominants that had stopped on the outskirts of the gathered furniture. They stared Mycroft down for a minute before huffing and turning away. “Now, where were we?”
“Yes, she had a bit of a fever when I… when she joined me,” he said. “She was checked out by a trusted paramedic and she said baby paracetamol for the fever, which I did. The fever seems to have gone down.” Mycroft tried to tamp down the note of panic he could feel creeping into his voice.
Liz nodded.
Sherlock and Mycroft were tucked in the corner of the giant ballroom, holding their complementary beverages in front of them like shields. They were bent close to one another, deducing everyone else in the room and steadily dismissing potential mates.
It had been one month since the first gathering and in the meantime Mycroft had been diligently texting Greg, although they hadn’t been able to see each other during that time. Although Mycroft wasn’t outwardly nervous, an inner turmoil was filling him. It all depended on this moment- he had already told the organizers of the experiment that he had found a sub and they were ready to let him take the position in the government, as long as he could prove he and Greg were together.
John and Sherlock arrived at the Ministry via Floo Powder ten minutes later. As soon as they stepped out of the fireplace, they were greeted by Anthea.
“All sorted?” the D.I. asked.
Sherlock brought Jackie into the dining room, sitting her in her high chair. He sat down beside her at the head of the table. As Mycroft entered with the mashed potatoes, he shot Sherlock a look. “A couple seats down if you please, brother. I will sit beside my daughter at the head of the table.”
“Mycroft, can you turn towards me please?” Greg asked softly, but with authority. Mycroft rolled over so that he was facing Greg, curled in the fetal positing with one hand tucked under his cheek. Greg reached for the other hand, cradling it in one of his own.
“Happy Easter,” he said.
“Not really,” Greg said, looking around. He noticed Jackie staring at a stuffed dog in a police outfit. He broke out into a grin. Mycroft narrowed his eyes at the mischievous glint in Greg’s eye. Following his gaze, Mycroft noticed where he was looking, huffed and rolled his eyes.
“You push the cart and I’ll pick all the food?” Greg teased.
“The few I have figured out I have tried, but it doesn’t seem to be working.”
“You’re sure that’s Liz?” Sherlock asked.
When he emerged once more into the sitting room, Mycroft crossed to the sofa and sat down, plunking the two mugs of tea onto the low coffee table located in front of the sofa.
“Dad?” she asked, looking at John.
“Yup! Now do I get to see my present?” Greg grinned up at Mycroft, and Mycroft couldn’t help but imagine Greg in a set of footie pajamas grinning up at him. They may need to have another discussion about age play soon.
Mycroft looked into Greg’s eyes for a moment. “I still don’t like this apartment.”
“Well, since everything is in order, I will be saying my farewells for now,” Mycroft said, interrupting John’s thoughts. He looked at Liz, eyes softening imperceptibly around the edges. “It was nice to meet you, Liz. I’m sure I will be seeing you shortly. Brother, John,” he nodded at each man in turn before turning on his heel and retrieving his umbrella, hooking it over his arm before letting himself quietly out of the flat.
“It’s been a while since we’ve had to do this.” John looked at Mycroft. “You can’t afford to get shot, seriously, Mycroft,” John said as he packed up his bag. “There are people in this world that would miss you, including Sherlock and myself.”
Jackie tottered up to Alice’s bench. “Up!” she said imperiously. Alice leaned over without hesitation and picked her up mid-sentence, putting Jackie on her lap.
“You had it, you just needed someone to tell you that you had it,” Greg said, bouncing Jackie on his knee as he handed her the bear and took a sip of his drink.
Greg turned so that he was facing Mycroft, one leg propped up on the sofa. “Lucky,” he agreed smiling. He looked down. “It looks like you’ve got something on your shoes,” he said, leaning down.
“Very well,” Mycroft sat down cross-legged beside Greg, who swiftly stood and moved to the kitchen. As he dug out the can of pasta, he heard thrilled shrieks come from the other room. After he had emptied it into a saucepan and put it on the burner, he went to the sitting room and watched from the doorway as Mycroft put the finishing touches on an elaborate block tower. Greg dug out his phone and managed to snap a picture of the tower and it’s imminent destruction. He also managed to catch Mycroft as he turned towards the door to address Gregory.
“You know, you should put some out in the open too, don’t hide them all.”
“Please,” Greg said quietly, looking up at Mycroft. Mycroft reached to his chair, where he had discarded the collar. Picking it up, he leaned forward and slipped it around the back of Greg’s neck, carefully clasping it at the front.
“Okay, arms up.” John slid the shirt off and carefully put it to the side. “Where did your Mummy hit you?”
“Yes, now put your shirt back on, let’s go!” Sherlock scooped up John’s jumper that had been discarded earlier and shoved it at John’s chest.
“Wait,” Mycroft said coolly, a corner of his mask slipping as his eyes softened and he rocked Jackie back and forth. Her shrieks had turned into body-wracking sobs.
“Doe!” she cried.
“You’re coming close to a spanking,” John told him quietly. “Did you really not know that you were making it sound like I was abusing you?”
“At least I’m not in a three-piece suit,” Sherlock bit back, giving Mycroft a once-over in the reflection of the mirror.
“Sir, would you like me to order the things required to care for a baby?”
“Yes, one would say it is impossible.” Mycroft was proud to note that his voice only wavered slightly. “Although, I suppose the genetic modification helps with that.”
“Don’t think of it as a bad thing,” his mother insisted. “Think of it as an opportunity to help ameliorate the functioning of society as a whole.”
John woke early the next morning and went out to the sitting room. His heart nearly stopped when he saw a dark figure hunched over on the sofa. He pulled out his wand, crossing silently around so that he was in front of the sofa. He put down his wand when he saw that it was Liz, wrapped in the afghan and looking at John with bright eyes.
Sherlock reluctantly clambered off John’s lap, rubbing his arm across his face and tucking his thumb once more in his mouth.
“Sure,” Hermione answered. They all made their way over to the table. “Hi Liz, it’s nice to see you again,” Hermione said, smiling warmly at Liz as she sat down across from her. Ron sat down beside her, across from John.
“What, erasing memories? We train very hard in order to be able to perform that spell with the precision and accuracy it requires,” Hermione answered primly.
Sherlock sighed and sat up. “Yes, but that was as punishment. When you do it as punishment, it’s got more… emotion to it? I’m not sure I’m explaining this well. Do you get what I’m saying?”
“You’re like a giant bloody cat,” John said appreciatively, running his hand down Sherlock’s back before grabbing the riding crop. “We’ll try a few hits. Not too many, mind, since this is our first time.”
“Let’s take a look then.” John placed his medical bag on the bed and opened it up. “Sherlock, will you go help Greg with breakfast?”
“He leaves his socks on the floor. It’s unbearable,” Mycroft smirked, leaning back.
“Well, why don’t you each get your baskets and we’ll start this hunt,” Greg said. Both children scrambled to pick up the baskets that were sitting on the coffee table beside their presents. “And then we’ll do presents.” Alice whooped, picking up her basket and trembling with excitement.
Mycroft heaved a put-upon sigh. “Very well, look away.” Greg averted his eyes.
“Nonsense, you’ve got the linens in the house, right?”
“I’d like to keep trying.”
“Never.” John grinned at Sherlock.
“Yeah, you know, couples have favourite spots to go that are usually significant in some way.”
Mycroft let a small chuckle escape past his lips. “Something like that, yes. What else do you like to do, when you’re not working at New Scotland Yard?”
Well, we are nearing the end, I have an epilogue that I'll hopefully post in the next week or so, and I will probably write more in this universe eventually. Hope you've enjoyed it, let me know if you did :)
“Yes alright, you great git, let’s go,” John said, leading Sherlock towards the street. “Get us a cab.”
“About what?” Sherlock asked distractedly, his mind starting to float peacefully.
“You… make a good point.” Mycroft nodded. “Is that not why we have safewords?”
“Thank you?” John said, accepting the garment bag and draping it on his chair. Carefully he pulled the zip down, revealing two sets of casual robes, one in black and the other significantly smaller in periwinkle blue. “Oh, thank you!” he said more enthusiastically, grinning over at Sherlock and Liz. “But how did you know we were going to Diagon Alley?”
“Why do you want her so bad?” Mycroft asked.
“These are nice,” he said, showing them to Liz.
“It’s a good thing I have a spare room,” Mycroft said to Jackie, who was sitting on the floor of said room, happily banging blocks on the floor. He had quickly snapped out of his panic after the moving men arrived, directing them to drop the large boxes in his spare room. He turned down their offer to help him set things up and sent them on their way with a generous tip.
“I’ve been better,” Sherlock said, eyes softening as he looked at John. “Did you catch him?” Sherlock asked, looking at Lestrade.
“How is John?” Mycroft rebutted, his eyes running over Sherlock once more.
“You like that?” Mycroft asked, picking it up off the shelf. It was a sandy brown, a little bigger than his hand and softer than sin. He handed it to Jackie, who wrapped her arms around it immediately. “Anything else that catches your eye?” But Jackie was enthralled with the bear now, rubbing her face in the soft fur. Mycroft smiled softly and then an idea occurred to him. Pulling out his phone, he quickly clicked a photo and sent it to Anthea, pocketing the phone once more and pushing forward. He spotted blocks with letters and pictures on all sides. Taking a set off the shelf, he put it in the shopping cart. Beside that set was another set, a set of blocks with the periodic elements on them.
“Make a wish, love,” Mummy murmured, setting the cake carefully down in front of Sherlock.
“You’re good with her,” John said to Sherlock, smiling at him.
“I’m not sure what drew me to her,” he admitted, staring determinedly into his glass. “Why I didn’t just hand her off to CPS, or leave her there for someone else to find.”
“You may leave me now.”
“Mr. Holmes doesn’t do hospitals,” Marcia said, her tone revealing exactly what she thought about that.
“It’s alright,” John hastened to reassure her, quickly pulling out his wand and pointing it at the mug. “Reparo,” he said, and the mug pieces sealed themselves back together. “Tergeo,” he said, siphoning up the remaining cocoa. “See? All better,” he said soothingly, holding a hand out placatingly to Liz while putting his wand on the coffee table. “It’s okay. We won’t hurt you.”
“I wanted to show him,” Mycroft grumbled as Sherlock swanned out the door.
“It will take me a while to get used to that sight,” John said, smiling at Jackie.
Greg smiled up at Mycroft. “I’m glad to hear that,” he said, linking one of his hands with the one on the back of his neck.
“Good, good.” He looked over at Mycroft and a smile lit up his face.
“Far be it from me to deign to figure out what my brother is planning,” Sherlock shrugged, turning and going back into the kitchen.
"Um, sir I wouldn't-" but Marcia's warning came too late as vomit covered Jaclynn's front as well as a good portion of Mycroft's lap and bare chest. Mycroft just shrugged and sighed; honestly his day couldn't get any worse. Marcia got flannels from a compartment in the ambulance and quickly mopped up the vomit, throwing the dirty flannels in a plastic bag and settling in to look at Mycroft's side. "It's not bad," she commented as she cleaned it. "No stitches I'll just bandage it up for you." And she did just that, efficiently wrapping Mycroft's torso in white gauze and taping the end to the rest of the bandage. She then handed him a paracetamol to swallow dry. Jaclynn had slowly calmed down throughout the process, the tears stopping but her thumb staying firmly in her mouth.
The message pinged on his phone.
“Don’t answer that!” John said. “What is or isn’t the dynamic of their relationship is none of your business, Sherlock.”
“Well work faster,” Sherlock snapped as John tilted his hand, deciding whether it needed stitches or not. Sherlock ended the call, slamming his phone onto the table. “Fat load of good that did,” he groused, slouching in his chair as John pulled out butterfly bandages.
“John.” He stood.
“Were we wrong?” Sherlock asked with a raised brow.
Mycroft let the next one fall harder than the first two. “Three, thank you,” Greg said. By seven, he was speaking through clenched teeth and by eleven his fingernails were digging into Mycroft’s ankle.
John barked out a laugh. “And yet I have a feeling it will happen often.”
“I’m going to kiss you now,” John murmured, rocking forward onto the balls of his feet. Slowly, he slipped his hand behind Sherlock’s neck and threaded his fingers through the curls at the nape. Looking deep into Sherlock’s eyes, John closed the small gap and rested his lips on Sherlock, just holding them there for a second. When he got no adverse reaction, he started moving his lips, shuffling forward until one of his feet rested between Sherlock’s. This allowed him to wrap his other hand around Sherlock’s shoulder, pulling him down towards him. Sherlock gasped as John started moving his lips, grabbing onto John’s waist for dear life. This was his first kiss and he was desperately trying to catalogue every new feeling and texture and thrill that went through him. His John room was steadily become more populated, the bookshelves and walls becoming fuller. John pulled away slowly, lightly running his nails over the nape of Sherlock’s neck.
Sherlock fell more and more limp as the strikes continued and at number fifteen, he let out a bodily sob. John immediately stopped. “Do you need to use your safeword?” John asked, leaving his hand hovering in the air.
“Ah, is that the dynamic in this relationship?” Sherlock asked, eyes cutting between the two of them.
“Is she yours?” the woman asked kindly from beside them.
Sherlock considered him for a moment. “You’ll make an alright doctor. Good in high-pressure situations. The addiction to danger though, that may make the days of being a family doctor monotonous.”
“Tedious, although we have gotten a little closer to finding out who attacked us. Nothing I can divulge.”
“Hey, Liz, you’re okay, you’re good,” John said reassuringly from beside her.
“Sure,” Greg said, shifting until he was under the blankets, facing Mycroft and Jackie. Jackie looked over to see what all the commotion was about, watching Greg settle in. Greg put his hand on Jackie’s tummy. “Hi, gorgeous,” he said gently. She cooed gently back at him, reaching her hand towards him and opening and closing her fist. Mycroft put his hand over Greg’s, closing his eyes and falling asleep.
“Come here,” Mycroft beckoned to their newly-positioned sofa and sat down, patting the spot beside him. Greg, without further encouragement, slumped down into the spot next to him with a gusty sigh. Mycroft put his arm around Greg and drew him close, laying a kiss on the top of his head. “Do you need to be put down?” he murmured against the crown of Greg’s head.
“The park can’t be your answer for everything,” Greg said, chuckling. “How about a restaurant? What’s your favourite restaurant to take dates to?”
“Da?” she said.
They spent most of the morning like this, Jackie occasionally making a break for it and Mycroft quickly catching her before she crawled too far. It was around lunch that their day changed.
“Awww!” she cooed as she placed their drinks on the table. “How long have you two been together?”
“It’s been a week, mother, not a century,” Sherlock groused as they entered the house, leaving their coats in the hall closet and proceeding to the living room.
“You realize some of them have probably already died?”
“Hello?” Gregory’s voice came down the line sounding annoyed.
“Leather clothing is a three on me but a five one you.”
“That’s fine,” John said. “I’m going to get my kit, I’ll be right back, alright?”
“Right,” John confirmed. “It’s 17 Sickles to a Galleon, and 29 Knuts to a Sickle.”
“Jackie? A pedestrian name, isn’t it?”
“Nothing, just enjoying the view,” Greg smirked just as their waitress came back.
“You’ve gone a bit green, so I’ll take that as a no,” Greg said. “Tea?”
“It makes him unavailable to me when I need him, so I am not all that fond.”
He saw blood and brain matter spattered against the wall. He lifted the bottle to his mouth, the nausea that he had recently escaped coming back full force and Mycroft was weak to prevent it. The contents of his stomach, which only consisted of expensive alcohol, started to come up and it was only by a miracle that Mycroft made it to the toilet before the burning liquid came back up, hitting the toilet bowl loudly. Mycroft tried to suppress the gagging and be as quiet as he could, but it was no use. He felt a cool hand on his forehead, which made him retch even more. The hand disappeared, and Mycroft thought he had been abandoned. A part of him figured he deserved it after the vile things he had done. When he finished retching, Mycroft leaned back. Tears had leaked out of his eyes while he was vomiting, and he scrubbed a hand across his face, wiping away any moisture there.
“How much company will we be having? I was kind of hoping it would be just the two of us, for a while at least.” Greg made his way back to Mycroft and deftly slid his hand into his Dom’s. Mycroft shot a look at the realtor before leaning in close to Greg.
“Oh come, don’t cry just tell me where you came from.” Sherlock insisted. Fat tears rolled down the girl’s cheeks.
Sherlock unwound Liz’s hand from his coat and took it in his hand instead.
“Brother,” Sherlock greeted. Mycroft could see John stood a little behind him.
It was a few days later that found Sherlock and John sorting through the rubble at 221B, salvaging what they could and binning the rest.  Then it was another week of meeting with contractors and having them traipsing around 221B, and then they were finally moving in for good, setting up Rosie’s room in Sherlock’s old room and trying to find enough space in one closet for both of their things. And then it was Sherlock handing Rosie off to John and grabbing the strap-on carrier so that they could take Rosie to her first crime scene and it was late nights and colds and spats and first steps and first times and heartache and love and it was perfect. They were finally home.
“That’s easy for you to say, you aren’t reduced to an attention-seeking, obedient foot-kisser.”
“I- well- if there is no other alternative?”
“Why is everyone so… chipper around here?” Mycroft asked absently.
“Cow, cow, cow!” she said happily, giggling and clapping her hands together.
The D.I. heaved a big sigh. “Look, we’re really in the shit here so I’ll let him on. But one toe out of line…” the D.I. pointed threateningly at both boys.
“Liz?” John said, slightly alarmed. He loosened his hold on Liz, but didn’t let go completely. “Liz, wake up!”
“No! No! No! No! No!” Sherlock shouted, punctuating each “no” with a stomp up the stairs. When he had reached the top he stomped into the room, slamming the door behind him.
“Mycroft, that’s incredible,” John said. “How did you do it?”
*******
She nodded furtively.
John knew that although he and Sherlock hadn’t had a proper conversation about it, he was telling the truth.
“Liz!” Sherlock yelled as John entered the kitchen. Sherlock was on the stool, clutching his hand and staring at the empty space in front of him.
Liz shook her head again.
“Yes, well, babies are too new to be dull,” he retorted. John just rolled his eyes.
“Hello, you must be Holmes,” he said, standing and rounding the desk to shake hands with all three of them.
“I’m going to take you back to mine,” Greg told him, “Okay?”
“Don’t be ridiculous, Greg. I’m fine.”
“Good morning, Liz.”
“No, no, I think we’re too comfortable right now for that,” John soothed, running his hands slowly up and down Sherlock’s calves. “Just relax.”
John recoiled. Sherlock rarely yelled at him in seriousness. He often shouted when he was bored or frustrated, but rarely out of anger and never directly at John. Thinking back, John realized that he hadn’t put Sherlock properly into subspace in at least a month. Between his job at the clinic and the non-stop cases, he had forgotten.
“No.“ Sherlock fidgeted with his hands.
“I think you’re probably ready to go home, hm?”
Floating on the small buzz that started to work its way into his system, Mycroft closed his eyes and tried to clear his mind for a few moments.
“Safehouse number 3,” Mycroft told the driver after they were both securely inside.
“Yes, what John said,” Sherlock agreed.
Charlie carefully unwrapped his present, revealing a book about space.
Shaking himself back into the present, John made his way more sedately up the stairs and stopped at the nursery door, knocking softly.
“You’re safe with us now,” John reassured her once more. “We promise, we’ll take care of you, alright?”
An indeterminate amount of time passed, Greg sinking further and further into his thoughts. When the door to the flat clicked opened, Greg didn’t notice, the buzz of the thoughts in his head drowning out all other noise.
“Sit,” he greeted them, pointing at the two chairs across his desk. Sherlock waited for John to sit before taking the seat next to him. He then returned to his paperwork, letting the two men stew for a couple of minutes. “So what made you think it was a good idea to go running after a murderer?” He asked, leaning back in his chair once he had finished filling out the last piece of paper on his desk.
“I will be going to interrogate her tonight,” Mycroft said. “Hopefully I will find out exactly who they are, why they are here and how they knew where we were, among other things. Meanwhile, you will stay in the house with Jackie. Some of my people will be coming over as extra security. You will also be getting a firearm.”
“Everything’s fine between us,” John added.
“She’s a chaser, through and through,” Ron said proudly.
“Okay,” Greg said, taking it in stride. “I’ll put her in a coat and clothes, you grab bottles and food enough for her and anything else you need to bring with you.”
“I do, but if you would like to accompany us, I would not be opposed.”
“We brought dessert,” Sherlock said, lifting the bag he was holding.
“What shall we pick?” Greg asked playfully to Jackie as he bounced her in his arms. “Any preferences, Mycroft?”
The next day, Liz took her time choosing from the meager selection of clothes hung in her closet. She chose a navy blue long sleeve shirt and a pair of jeans, and proudly emerged from her bedroom.
Liz nodded after a moment of hesitation, reaching over and grasping Sherlock’s hand in hers.
“Like it was shot,” Mycroft answered honestly.
Sherlock didn’t know what to say to that so they sat in silence. Sherlock glanced at the alarm clock on the bedside table.
“That would be great, thanks!” Greg said, smiling at Mycroft. He watched Greg for a moment more before moving into the kitchen. He turned the coffee maker on and set four pieces of toast in the toaster. Leaning against the counter, Mycroft let himself drift into his thoughts, reflecting over the rather tumultuous past couple days. If someone had asked him a week ago where he thought he would be today, he would have easily answered almost every country in the world, but never would he have thought he would be in a safe house with a baby and Gregory Lestrade.
John pulled out his wand and held it out, pointing it at the bruise. “Brackium Emendo,” he said, watching Liz’s face. She frowned at the white glow emanating from his wand, and there was a moment of tightness on her face before she relaxed. “Better?” John asked as the light faded. Liz nodded. “Good. Now, how do we feel about a lunch?”
“Yeah, about a day ago,” John answered.
“Don’t worry about that, Mycroft. You can sleep in the bed with me too, if you want?”
“As I saw? Yeah, as I saw, as I saw your unconscious body on this bed and I waited for you to wake up and took care of Jackie and hoped that you would wake up okay.”
Liz was quietly sitting in Sherlock’s lap, mug cradled between her two hands as she steadily drank the cocoa.
“No.”
“That was a lie. Would you like to try again?” Mycroft asked delicately. Greg’s hands squeezed into fists at his sides and he took a sharp breath in.
“Right, next is pain. You like pain, but there’s a limit.”
Sherlock sat and blinked for a moment, looking between John and Mrs. Hudson.
“Can you?”
“Yes, Daddy’s run off to catch the bad guys, he’ll be back shortly hopefully,” Greg said, unsure if she could understand any of what he was saying.
“Likewise. You were extraordinary. Remember to drink water and take an ibuprofen tonight, you had quite a bit to drink.”
“Goodnight, Gregory.”
“I will.”
It all started when Sherlock turned fourteen. Well, it actually all started when Mycroft turned fourteen, but Sherlock was only nine at the time and was therefore oblivious to the change in his brother’s life.
“Up we go,” John said, taking Liz’s hand and leading her into the building, Sherlock trailing behind. They entered the building and went up to the second floor.
“Enjoying the view?”
“Cow!” Jackie confirmed.
When they were done Mycroft paid the bill and they headed back to the car and on towards the safe house. When they arrived, Greg pulled Jackie from the car seat and propped her on his hip, digging the carrier from the back and carrying it in his other hand. Mycroft, meanwhile, grabbed the grocery bags and brought them inside.
“Thank you,” Greg aid, getting up and taking hold of Mycroft’s hand as he stood.
“Well that’s a given. I meant anything other than that.”
“Of course I am,” Sherlock hiccupped between sobs. “I would have safe worded if I wasn’t.” Sherlock’s breaths were coming easier now and the tears were slowing. “This is good, I needed the emotional release,” Sherlock admitted quietly after a few moment.
“Already all taken care of,” Mycroft waved his hand in Greg’s direction.
Sherlock hummed in agreement. This gathering was supposed to be some sort of party designed to find your eternal mate. Sherlock thought it was ridiculous that two hundred people between the ages o f eighteen and twenty-five were meant to find their soulmate among a selected sampling. The scientists had assured them that not everyone would find their soulmate in one night, and that there would be a line-up of similar socials held at later dates. Sherlock was determined to do all he could do to drive away any potential suitors. He didn’t need people or relationships to make him happy or complete; he was fine on his own, had always been fine on his own.
“Hello?”
Mycroft didn’t dignify that with a response but instead finished loosening his tie. He stored it over the back of the chair in the room. “Better?” he asked.
“Excuse me?” She cried.
When Sherlock was ensconced in his molecule-decorated footie pajamas, John led him out and back into his bedroom. He pulled back the covers on the bed, getting Sherlock to lie down and pulling the cartoon-covered comforter over him.
“You said you like violin last time. Do you play much?”
“Okay, let’s do this,” John said, placing his arm on top of Sherlock’s.
“Feeding?”
“David’s gone out to pick up food for Monday.” It was late Saturday afternoon, and Greg and Mycroft would have the kids until Monday morning.
The people from the lab come to try to get Jackie back, prompting the three of them to escape to a safe house.
“You seem like the type to need a strong hand,” the woman behind him said. “The kind who needs to be… shown… how to obey.”
“I have an announcement to make, actually,” Mycroft said, absentmindedly forking a piece of roast onto his plate. Putting down his fork, he straightened and re-straightened the napkin in his lap. “Gregory and I are moving in together,” he said, glancing up.
“It will be the first eight hours of straight sleep he’s gotten in about two years,” Mycroft said, trying to suppress the note of awe that had crept into his voice.
“Oh? And where are you two from?”
“Twelve thank you,” Greg ground out, burying his face into the side of his arm.
“John,” Sherlock called softly from the doorway. “John,” he called a little louder. He moved to the end of the bed. “John, wake up!” he called. “John, it’s me, Sherlock.”
“Yes, thank you,” John answered, pulling away. “We were worried sick.”
“John, you’re a wizard, correct?” Dr. Witter asked.
“What-“ Greg started.
“Mycroft is a wizard,” Sherlock answered matter-of-factly. “You probably crossed over at Hogwarts for a few years.”
Liz managed to shrug and nod at the same time.
“Ready to go?”
“Quite. Well, I’m going to turn in.” Sherlock turned and wandered down the hall to his room.
“Seven. Now can I see the body?”
“I look forward to it,” Greg chuckled. Then he turned serious. “That is what you’re looking for here, isn’t it? Exclusivity? A future, whatever it may look like?” Mycroft admired Gregory’s straightforward attitude.
“Well, now is as good a time as any,” Greg answered. “I can take her if you want to go get it?”
“Shit,” he swore roughly, slamming the broken tap on the counter and growling in frustration. He slammed the tap handle back on, making sure it worked. He rubbed one hand roughly over his eyes and considered succumbing to the pressure building up behind them when a loud commotion came from the front door. “Seriously?” he mumbled quietly under his breath, pulling the gun that Mycroft had given him out of his hip holster and moving quietly to the kitchen door, carefully leaning around the corner. A giant dark mass was outlined by the front door and Greg could hear grunting. Slowly moving towards the front door he raised the gun, clearing his throat.
“Of course,” Mycroft responded, shocked at the doctor’s outburst. “I’m just not sure how to do that.”
“You’re welcome,” Mycroft said.
“Well then it’s a miracle that you are a D.I. if you let morons on crime scenes.”
“I know, you’ve said,” Sherlock said quietly as John sat on the sofa, picking Sherlock’s feet up and plopping them onto his lap. He started slowly rubbing his hands along Sherlock’s long feet, digging his thumb into the arches. Sherlock let a low groan escape his lips as John worked over his feet, tension slowly easing out of his feet and legs.
“The places where you need to sign are marked,” he said, procuring a pen for John to sign.
“Let’s try this, shall we?” he asked, sitting down on one of the chairs at the kitchen table and sitting Jackie on his lap. Opening the container, Mycroft dipped the spoon into the purée and presented it to Jackie. Leaning forward, she wrapped her lips around the small spoon and Mycroft pulled it out of her mouth, clean. She smacked her lips, a clear invitation for more.
“Whatever, Mycroft.”
“I could say the same,” John whispered softly.
“Gregory, please,” Mycroft called softly, knowing he needed to give his sub space to work things out on his own, but feeling his heart breaking at the sight of Greg’s distress.
“No,” Greg answered simply, a little distant.
“Sorry,” he said hoarsely. “That was a bit… surprising,” he chuckled wetly.
“Me too,” Mycroft agreed. “You go to the sitting room and I’ll check on Jackie?”
“Exactly. Plus, if we don’t know what one is, what’s ten?”
“Did you really think we hadn’t put more security on the building after last time?” she asked calmly, gun not wavering in her hand.
“I would just like to go to sleep, then,” Mycroft said.
“It’s alright, I suppose. The tingle is nice, but it’s nothing significant.” Sherlock awkwardly shrugged one shoulder.
“Well, I’ll go prepare breakfast while you do that, shall I?” Mycroft said.
They pounded down the stairs and out the door before coming to a halt.
“I must get inside. Have a good evening John, Sherlock.” With that, Mycroft stalked past them and into the house, bypassing the crime scene tape and the constable stationed there.
John walked over to the edge of the bed and picked up the flogger, running the leather straps against his hand before looking up at Sherlock.
“Sherlock,” John mumbled, face contorting into a pained expression. “Sherlock, no!” Tears started coursing down his face.
"Of course. I will see you soon."
“Sherlock said I should come see you?”
“How’s it going down there?” Mycroft asked softly, easing his nails off of Greg’s scalp and gently carding the pads of his fingers through Greg’s hair. It took Greg a moment to form words; his tongue was heavy and relaxed in his mouth.
“Yes, I had thought of that. ”Mycroft was walking towards a store called ‘Lots and Lots For Babies and Tots’.
The gang goes to Diagon Alley
John took a moment to write out what had just been discussed.
When Sherlock turned fourteen, he started noticing changes in himself. Predominantly, he suddenly wanted to please everyone around him. It started with small things, like being more willing to do the dishes when his mother asked or leaving his older brother alone when commanded. And every time he would accomplish a task, he would be thanked and praised. Not that he wasn’t praised before he turned fourteen, because he was, but now it sent a warm thrill through him every time, encouraging him to continue being accommodating in a way it hadn’t previously. The changes happened gradually over a few months and, on the date of his fourteenth birthday, Sherlock’s parents sat him down in their living room.
“How are you feeling?”
“Milk, two sugars and some honey.”
“Well, looks like it’s just you and me, kiddo,” Greg said, looking at Jackie in his arms. “Let’s make the beds first, shall we?”
“Yes, it is. I don’t mind the orders you give me, you know. I agree with them a lot of the time in fact, or know in some objective way that they are probably good for me. But if I don’t like the orders you give me, then we’ll have a problem.”
Suddenly an insistent electronic beeping permeated throughout the kitchen. Greg furrowed his brow in confusion, looking around.
“A gambler, Sherlock. Look at the sleeve cuffs,” Mycroft corrected.
“There you go, my beautiful boy.”
John glanced around the room, taking in the nappy paraphernalia scattered around the base of the changing table, and the toy box in the opposite corner that had been over turned, belching out it’s contents.
“Can we have a shower?” Greg asked eventually, not pulling his face out of Mycroft’s neck.
“Oh, but I do, just as I know that you don’t wash your hands after using the washroom.”
“Four,” Sherlock was tapping away at his phone. It was held precariously over his face as he lay on the sofa, head in John’s lap. At their first therapy session, the therapist had handed John what he called a ‘limits list’, a long checklist of activities often found in dom/sub relationships. Even though this list was based off of relationships between unmodified adults, it provided a strong basis for discussions between couples.  They had been sitting on the sofa for twenty minutes already and Sherlock had been steadily giving curt answers. John made notes diligently on the paper- although Sherlock didn’t know it, they would be going over the list again to discuss each answer once they were done going through it.
“Sherlock, be nice,” John scolded from behind him.
“Set the table?” Greg asked. Wordlessly Mycroft put Jackie on the floor and set about digging out two plates and cutlery. When the beans were done, Greg divided them evenly between the two plates and sat at the table. Mycroft sat across from him, picking at his beans and eating a couple at a time. Although they weren’t great, they were filling, and that was all that mattered. Jackie tried to make a break for it a few times, but Mycroft was quick enough to catch her before she could crawl out of the kitchen.
“Three. Four. Five. Right, in the corner.”
“Interesting,” John said. A whole new dimension to the brother’s relationship had just revealed itself.
Sherlock didn’t respond, staring resolutely at the people around him. Mycroft nodded once and wandered away, not looking back.
“The people behind us have guns,” he whispered in Greg’s ear. “Stay calm and go straight to the car. My people are on their way.” They walked a little faster, but the couple drew even with them easily.
“For what purpose? To wear, to look at, to colour with?”
“He is doing well, he’s just got out of surgery. He’ll be asleep for a while yet but he’s in his room now so you may go see him if you wish.”
Needless to say, it was not one of Sherlock’s favorite birthdays.
“Thank you,” Mycroft said, crossing to him and putting his hand on Greg’s shoulder. “It means a lot how understanding you’re being.”
“Eating slows- that’s the most ridiculous thing I’ve ever heard.”
“Mycroft said…” she petered off, looking nervously at the hem of her shirt. “you’re my dads?”
“Yes, actually, put that gun away and turn on a light, for starters,” a gruff female voice replied. “Also I could use a hand with this idiot.”
“You’re quite welcome. I’m glad to see you are becoming more comfortable with magic.”
“My favourite animal is a tiger.” He smiled once more at Sherlock.“Are you thirsty? I could really go for some tea right now.”
“When we find the right one,” Mycroft sniped in return. Greg closed his eyes briefly before opening them again.
“It is not very appealing,” Mycroft agreed with a low chuckle.
“I had every right to be angry at that idiot,” Sherlock said, venom creeping into his voice.
“Brother, lovely to see you too. It appears that the documents that were stolen from the victim are of a sensitive nature. The government has sent me to take over the investigation.”
The rest of the day passed quietly. A few different outfits arrived in the afternoon, courtesy of Mycroft. Sherlock and John set up the unused upstairs bedroom for Liz. They assured her that she could come and get them at any time during the night, and they all went to bed.
“What was that?” Sherlock asked.
“Open up,” John said, leaning down to hold a corner of sandwich against Sherlock’s lips. Obediently he opened up, letting John slip the morsel into his mouth and sucking on John’s fingers. John took a bite of his sandwich, running his hands contently through Sherlock’s curls. He then fed another torn-off piece of sandwich to Sherlock, who took it without complaint, this time nipping at John’s fingertips.
“Anybody want to help their old man?” Greg asked, turning towards where his children were sitting.
“I’m very good.”
“Tea?” Mycroft asked. Both men answered in the affirmative and Mycroft moved to start the kettle as John set out the needles on the table. By the time Mycroft was done making the tea, Sherlock was done feeding Jackie and she was sitting happily on his lap, waving her fists sporadically. He had one arm wrapped around her waist and the other one was waving in front of her, captivating her attention. Mycroft brought the two mugs of tea to the table and placed them in front of John and Sherlock.
“Thanks Charlie, you too,” he said. “Where’s Alice?”
Sherlock propped his head on his hand and looked back at John.
“Of course,” Greg confirmed. “Were there others?”
“Yeah, Marcia dragged your ass in here.”
“What To Expect? Where’d you get that?”
Greg sighed. “I’ll look away,” he said, the ‘obviously’ implied in his tone.
Liz looked balefully at them over her shoulder as she was coerced deeper into the daycare. John and Sherlock waved at her before turning and going out the door, walking hand-in-hand to a small café around the corner.
“Of course it is,” John said with a cheeky grin, smacking Sherlock on the bum. “Now, hands back on the bedrail, please.” Sherlock turned and complied, closing his eyes once more and bracing for the impact.  John picked up the flogger once more, swinging his arm back and forth before bringing it down with a loud CRACK on Sherlock’s back. Sherlock jerked from the unexpected force but felt a thrill go up his spine at the contact. Another strong impact landed, and Sherlock shivered at the goosebumps that travelled up his spine. It was like the shockwaves from the strong impact were going straight through his nerves and to his brain, making it shiver on impact.
“That’s what you made it sound like,” John muttered from beside him.
“If you’re willing.”
“As sure as I can be,” she replied. They all peered closely at the map.
“Yes! Very good, Jackie, what a smart, smart baby.” He picked her up and kissed her on the cheek.
She tumbled into John’s lap, who let out an “oof” and put his newspaper to the side.
