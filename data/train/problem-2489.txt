John’s eyes were skimming over his face, trying to read him.
Extraordinarily abnormal behaviour for his shop-allergic flatmate. It was a red flag that John had missed. He should have known. Sherlock was going to get Moriarty, not milk.
Sherlock frowned. “Unless we all missed it. Perhaps there was something more important on the news that day. New photoset of the royal babies or something. That would be embarrassing.”
“I know what I can handle,” Sherlock snapped.
“Yoo-hoo!” came Mrs. Hudson’s voice through the door barely a moment before she opened it. She was carrying a large plate of biscuits covered by cling film. “Hello, boys,” she said looking back and forth between them. “I hope I’m not interrupting anything.”
“You have the resources to move him? I’m afraid he won’t be of much help.”
It was after eleven when they got into the cab.
"No! I don't want—I didn't mean—I'm so sorry to wake you! It's just—I didn't want to wait and I thought I'd come before work—"
John’s eyes flashed. “You are flesh and blood. You bruise and you break just like the rest of us. Look at your neck for Christ’s sake!”
“Only psychotic ravings, I’m sure,” Sherlock said with a smile.
“We’ll have to dig up the bodies,” Sherlock said to John.
Mary. Maybe I could forgive you for lying to me. I could forgive you for hurting me. But you hurt him. And I can’t forgive you for that.”
Sound rushed in on what had been perfect silence. Machines humming. Beeping. Voices. Squeaking wheels. Hands descended on them.

“I’m not going to leave,” Sherlock said, entranced by his flatmate’s unordinary behaviour.
“Because they’re
Sherlock was a many-faceted being, John marvelled. Whenever you felt sure you knew him he showed you another side of his capabilities, possibilities. He was, in other words, fascinating. But John had always known that. He'd known it from the moment they met in the lab and the young scientist with the dark hair and flecked eyes had sent his head spinning. He'd been captivated enough to move in with him, to write a blog about him.
told me—” He broke off, scowling at the ground.
“Weren’t counting on you though.” John smiled tentatively.
John had gotten his shirt off and he tossed it carelessly over the arm of his chair.
Mycroft, a memory.
There was a silence and John, who'd been staring at Sherlock, reminded himself to blink. The deductions went fast and John often found himself transfixed. It was genius, truly amazing and Sherlock had done it based only on his sense of smell.
Sherlock tried to summon the strength to be annoyed. He couldn’t feel the metal of the handcuffs on his wrists anymore. He couldn’t feel the chair beneath him anymore.
"Probably? You said, 'no question' before."
“I might if it were done properly.”
He wasn’t surprised. He didn’t give her enough credit to be able to act well enough to fool him—not an easy feat. So far only Moriarty and The Woman had been able to do it. No, she was genuine, everything from her stammering to her blushes—annoying but harmless. If she was working for someone she was doing it unwittingly. It wouldn’t take more than a gentle hand to help her connect the dots, even make her think she’d come up with the idea to go to Sherlock on her own. It wouldn’t be the first time a bad Samaritan had pointed him in the right direction. And if that was the case, so be it. The right direction was the right direction, regardless of who revealed the path. If someone with less than honorable intentions was waiting for him further down the road, he would meet him there.
“Did you see if there was a name on the van?” Sherlock asked.
John felt distinctly satisfied as Sherlock crossed to the game cupboard. There may be only one consulting detective in the world, but he was fairly certain there was also only one person who could handle him.
He’d walked a few blocks already; there was a main road up ahead. A black car screeched to a halt and someone leaped out. John stopped, watching the person running. Was he running toward

“I’m not at liberty to divulge names or details. I’ll just say that a certain organisation with some political influence has a job they want him for.”
. Father said there was nothing embarrassing about that.
He was going to die. His unlucky shot. SHERLOCK was a widower.
“Fine,” Sherlock said. Victor’s eyebrows shot up. “Meet me outside at seven-thirty. I’m not dressing up.”
He tried to hurry past the kitchen unnoticed, but Da’s voice stopped him short.
“No.”
Victor ordered them both Chinese chicken salads for dinner—the apparent specialty of the establishment—and Sherlock managed a few bites, avoiding the mandarin orange slices and incongruous ramen noodle bits. Victor did most of the talking, as well as most of the eating, but that tingling gaze remained focused on Sherlock’s mouth, his hands, his long throat when he swallowed his wine. The whole evening seemed... uncomfortably
“According to Eurus, her soulname developed during the night.”
“And in exchange?”
John snorted. “That’s what gets you hot? Pistols at dawn?”
“Quite. But he’s likely to come across increasingly interesting cases, as his prospects improve. If you mean to continue this crime-solving lark—”
“Better you than me,” she replied, and that was undeniably true.
“He’ll live.” When James shot him an unimpressed glance, John shook his head. “He lost the foot. Saved the knee, though. Won’t know about hypoxia until he wakes up.”
“It was
“How’s Evans?” James asked. John sighed.
“Sebastian,” Sherlock ventured quietly. “Do you love Margot?”
Mike’s eyes snapped into focus, meeting John’s self-deprecating smile. He laughed.
“He’s not

Mycroft sighed. It wasn’t his usual sigh—the one which said,
“Do you know the name?” Sherlock finally asked. “Have you deduced it?”
“’Course not,” John soothed. “Neither of us are.”
“Soulname?” Sherlock repeated, like an idiot. “That’s impossible. She’s too old.”
Blimey, mate. Have you gone full-gay, then?
of Eurus’s machinations. She has some hold over her most recent psychiatrist—some form of blackmail. So far, the man has not cooperated with any of our inquiries. He’s terrified. He’ll accept no assurance of our ability to protect him.”

He was going to die alone. Alone, bleeding out into the sand of a goddamned wasteland. He was going to die in the sand like so many soldiers before him, and John Watson could only think,
Harry’s soulname came in when she was nearly twelve. CLARA, it read. No chance of passing it off for a unisex moniker, at least not on this end. With any luck, Clara’s soulname read HARRY, not Harriet, and she’d be spared from the fate her soulmate was enduring. Ridicule. Scorn. Abuse. The world wasn’t kind to people with same-sex soulnames, and John knew that better than most. He’d developed thick skin and thicker calluses on his knuckles.
“Unavailable.”
John smiled weakly, and led Mum into a calm corner before he was forced to reply.
“Looks like it. He’s responding to stimuli.”
Instead, Sherlock checked the lock on his door and traded his uniform for worn pajamas. Couldn't risk a run to the loo until after lights-out, so he told his body sternly to stop its useless complaining. The history assignment took very little time, and even less of his brain, and soon Sherlock's thoughts were left to their own devices again. It was dark outside his window, and colder than he liked, when Sherlock began the arduous process of packing Eurus away into the back of his mind. Pulling her creeping tendrils from the cage bars and locking her up tight. It was hard. It was painful. But it wasn't boring.
“We... can’t be sure.”
“Will you agree next time as well? Perhaps with less scowling?”
Harry took the words to heart, breathing shallowly but quietly as the flush receded from her face. She dragged a hand through her frizzing hair and gulped her coffee. The scone still sat, mostly uneaten, on her plate.

“Afghanistan or Iraq?” Sherlock wondered aloud.
“Is it always like that, do you think?” John realized he’d wondered aloud, a moment too late. His cheeks felt hot and he sniffed in discomfort. “Just—you know—”
Sherlock knew he had to ask. He had to, but it turned his already fragile stomach. Mycroft waited, silently, for the question he surely must be expecting.
“I need the answers for the last few questions. My solution didn’t look right, toward the end.” Ulysses was advancing on Sherlock quickly. He had a martial glint in his eye.

“Mummy?” Sherlock asked.
“Everyone wants to find their soulmate,” John said woodenly. “But I’ve made my peace. I’m sure he isn’t looking for me.”
“What about after her graduation?”
“Would you like us to stay,” Father wondered, “or would you rather look for yourself first? I think the swelling’s gone down enough to read it.”

It's standard in the fandom to place Major Sholto's failed training mission AFTER John's discharge from the RAMC. The article Sherlock looks up online has no discernible publication date, but it is under the heading "Top Stories" and specifically states that the mother being interviewed "waved off [her son] one Sunday morning two years before." We can assume this has happened within two years of John's wedding. From a storytelling perspective, that is VERY interesting.
His heart was in danger of tachycardia.

“No cases without paperwork. Don’t test me, Genius.”
The girl stretched out across John’s disheveled bed was lovely—warm, and lean, and vocal. John loved when his partners talked. His tongue alternated between slow, soft licking and the flicking motion that made her dig manicured fingernails into his scalp. She even smelled lovely. John had never been with a man—John Watson was

, I mean.”
“It’s better than wanking by yourself while the barracks listens in,” James said wryly.
John smiled, flicking once more before he crawled his way up her quivering body. Dark hair, light eyes. Legs for days. John loved many kinds of women, but he had to admit that this was his favorite.
I had to rewrite it a bit. I had to.  I changed as little as I could, but I couldn't possibly leave this blog entry in its sorry original state.
Sherlock raised a brow. “Molly Hooper is an adequate pathologist.”
That was exactly what John thought. Men like Sherlock might want to be found, but not by a lower-class, same-sex soulmate with nothing to offer. If the registry were cheaper, everyone would use it. The common people might start to use those lofty, pretentious monikers, too, in hopes of increasing their chances for a fairytale match. Never mind that a true soulmatch didn’t work like that. Hope springs eternal when you’ve nothing to lose.

“You are an addict with a very unstable track record,” Mycroft retorted without pity. “But you’re nearly a year into your latest attempt at sobriety, and I’d hate for this unfortunate incident to upset your recovery.”
His soulmate was a man.
“If the man is pretty enough,” Victor shrugged. “You most certainly are.”
“Let’s hear it then,” Lestrade said, waving a hand.
I don't know how I'm meant to be writing this. I'm not a writer. Ella thought keeping a blog would help, but it hasn't. Not sure what kind of help it's meant to provide; a bit like whispering into a void, really. The black hole of the world wide web.
“This is our home. I can’t just pack up and leave at your whim,” Sherlock argued. Victor sucked in a breath, and Sherlock braced himself instinctively with one hand on the kitchen benchtop.
The silence was punctuated by a ticking clock. The grandfather in the hall? Of course,
“But Father is beside himself with worry. An act of this extremity could mean a lifetime of violent psychosis.”
“Eurus is no saint.”
“Eurus, dear,” Hadiya called from further down the hall, in that voice reserved only for Sherlock’s sister. “Back to bed, little bird.”
“Quite,” Mycroft said flatly. Father sent him a quelling look and Mycroft cleared his throat. “I regret that the news is far less pleasant than any...
“Fuck off.”
“I am. I’ll eat, you just sit there and look pretty.” Sherlock flushed, sliding the key into his dorm room door. Victor laughed. “It’ll be well worth it to me, you know. To pay for you to scowl at me across the dinner table.”
Sherlock’s heart swelled automatically, before his stomach dropped hard enough to send him to the sink. He bent over, gagging.
“I propose that you do not.”
that midterm exams were over a week ago. Where the hell have you been?” She dropped her bag in to an empty chair and pulled off her damp corduroy jacket. Her umbrella rested, a bit drippy, near her feet. She pointed a short finger at him. “I’ve called.”

“Sherlock,” Harry said, tasting the word on her tongue, cracking the final k. “Gran’s right. Sounds like a posh git.” John checked the back windows were clear before giving her a two-fingered salute. Harry just laughed and laughed.
So tomorrow, we're off to look at a flat. Me and the madman. Me and Sherlock Holmes.
He’d only met Clara once before, at her matching ceremony with Harry; he’d secured leave for the event and arrived that same morning. Harry had been radiantly happy, and Clara set John back on his heels with her sardonic wit. She was so beautiful—slender and lithe, with thick black hair piled up under her veil. In another life, if they were different people... well. John could hardly believe Harry’s luck.
“It’s all right if it isn’t.”
. No wonder everyone says you’re such a catch.”
Helen smiled, but her eyes were puzzled. “Do you think he’ll mind? That you’re so... Erm. That you aren’t waiting?”
Lestrade hummed, a sad little sound. “Yeah, she’s ‘Victoria,’ all right, but... Jesus, you cannot tell anyone. You understand?” He met Sherlock’s eye with a serious frown. “No one, Sherlock.”
“How? With scholarships?” Harry head took on a skeptical tilt.
It was better, really, that he’d probably never meet Sherlock. He couldn’t imagine

“You’re the second person to say that to me today!”
John gave a perfunctory sort of bow, which warmed Harry’s expression considerably, and then stepped over the line of bottle caps meant to indicate a door. Harry had a few plastic milk crates as seating, and she was sipping at a cola that sweated in the sunshine. She passed it to John, who took a small swig.
Harry was turning a bit red. “There’s nothing wrong with the man staying home with the kids, you colossal pig.”
It wasn’t awful.
to.” John didn’t reply, and James frowned, taking a step away. “Are you all right?”
She took his bare hand between soft-gloved fingers. Her eyes went wide and wet, which seemed in opposition to the soft smile. She looked... very pleased. It wasn’t an expression often aimed at Sherlock, but he’d seen her look just that way at his little sister, Eurus. Right before Nanny Hadiya murmured something like,
Sherlock did as he was told, but only because he couldn’t think of a cleverer solution. Also, he rather wanted his mother to be with him just now. Not in some babyish way, but... Well. His finger hurt.
“...Yeah.”
“I’m going home. Danielle has a project due tomorrow—something about tectonic plates. Got to make sure she’s dotted the I’s and crossed the T’s.”
...” She snorted, and John huffed a laugh.
Maybe John could talk Alice into coming with them to church on Sunday. Da was at his best first thing in the morning, and meeting John's girlfriend might ease everyone's mind for a bit. Give Da something to brag about at work. Alice was tough, and the Watsons would be on best behavior.
“What do Mummy and Father say?” Sherlock wanted to know.
“Not happening.”
John murmured back, “Meet you at the corner. Don’t forget your bag.”
“Bad luck, that,” Gran tutted. The fingers against his hand were soft as old cotton—cool and thin and worn-smooth at the fingertips. “Name like that one... must be a toff, yeah?”
The dial tone didn’t sound disappointed anymore. It sounded sad.
“Gran don’t like my soulname,” John said. Harry took back the bottle and set it on the ground between them.

John’s shower was short but blissfully cold, and he was reluctant to pull his vest back on once he managed to get dry. Sweat was a fact of life in the desert, but it didn’t mean John liked it. There was a lot about Afghanistan that John didn’t like. Heat. Bugs. Bloody buggering
John bobbed his head at a few sad smiles as he crossed the threshold into the dining room. He pulled at the arm of his mother’s jacket, and she turned away from old Mrs. Hampdon, who’d been talking nonstop for at least five minutes. “Excuse me, ma’am,” John said apologetically, “I need to borrow my Mum.”
“John.”

John sipped at his too-hot tea and tapped one foot nervously against the leg of the café table. Harry was late—Harry was
“Does he... does he know about me?”
“What exactly are we looking to prevent here?” Sherlock demanded. “What is she capable of? From inside Sherrinford?”
“No,” Sherlock agreed flatly. “Nothing quite like that.”
“They’re still taking fire further down,” Han said. John tucked the bite-strip between Evans’s teeth and pulled out the cauterization gun. John hated the smell of burning flesh, but he sealed up as much of the damage as he could. Evans didn’t flinch, which wasn’t a good sign.

Sherlock frowned. “Who’s Danielle?”
“And you look like you’re headed to an execution. Possibly yours.”
“Fine,” John huffed, shaking his head. “I’ll tell her. But you’re to be nice to her, when she calls. She won’t make you talk to him.”
“Yeah!” Harry agreed, warming to the subject. “Or even a car. One of those long, dark ones with the blacked out windows.”
Sherlock hung up.
“Yeah,” Harry snorted.  “Like, ‘get well soon’ and ‘happy birthday’ and everything else. Glittery. Some of those pop-up kinds. Lottie thinks he’ll be over it before Christmas, but who the hell knows?”
“Says it’s posh. Too posh for me.”

“Take a break, Mum. Harry and I can shake hands out here.”
.” Sherlock mouth shut with a sharp click. “You don’t understand what it’s like. A true soulmatch. Helios is...”
“Why on Earth not? She’s hiding it?”
“Do you want the details?” John asked. Harry grimaced.
John tried. He took a few deep breaths as James used John’s nearby towel to clean them both off. He was gentle. His face betrayed no uneasiness, no disgust. “We’re mates,” John finally whispered. James looked up at him. “You’re my best mate, over here.”
? Five years. A quinary of our lives.”
“All right,” Mycroft acquiesced. “The timing seems to confirm your suspicion. I believe the name on Eurus’s hand was ‘Hadiya.’”
“Checking on you. Avoiding Gran.”
And then... well, it seems quite unbelievable. But his name is Sherlock Holmes.
“I know that, Mycroft!” Sherlock snapped.
(See the end of the chapter for

you.”
His sister shrugged eloquently. “A couple paracetamol and a little Irish Cream in the first cup of the day. Works wonders.”
“Obviously.”
He asked the question, because that was what the genius Holmeses did. Ask and answer.
John winced. “Rough luck.”
“What happened to the lipstick?” Sherlock observed bluntly. Molly blushed.
Maybe, when John was old enough, he’d find himself a widow. They wouldn’t be soulmates, but they’d keep each other company. John could be happy with something like that.
. It was commanding, and not a bit unsettled. Sherlock mentally adjusted John’s military rank. First Lieutenant... no, Captain. Dear God.

And he hated JOHN, too. Whomever he was.
“Sebastian Wilkes is a young man whose reputation precedes him.”
“He’s a lucky man,” she told John in a quiet, wistful voice. “Wherever he is.”
“Hmm. Well. Less of a mess than Harry, I suppose.” She smirked at him, then lifted her left hand with a shrug. “It was so much easier for me. In some ways.” She traced the letters—HARRY—with a painted fingertip. “I’d never...
“Sorry?” John (
Eurus was in a long cotton nightdress, with her hair plaited frizzily on each side of her head. Sherlock scowled. He didn’t particularly want Eurus to see his soulname, or to hear it spoken aloud. Sherlock hadn’t even got a look at it himself yet.
Harry nodded solemnly. “Best come in, then. There are dragons in the garden.”

A hymn, then? What dark pit had John dragged that memory out of? Mum forcing Harry into an ironed dress and knotting John’s tie, walking them hand-in-hand down the narrow aisle of the local parish. The smell of incense, and the ache of the hard pew. Up and down—kneel and rise, kneel and rise—until John’s khakis were baggy at the knee. Mum’s little pill box hat, pinned in just so. They’d buried their mother in that hat.
..." Mycroft's tone was cynical. "I leave the decision to you. You know where to find me, should you change your mind.”
“No, you aren’t one for collaring, are you?” Victor said, slowly. His smirk didn’t fade.
“No.”
“It’s eleven o’clock, Harry—”
James came, and moaned, and leaned into John with all of his weight. His face contorted, and his stomach contracted, and he buried his face in John’s neck. He smelled like sand and sex. His come was on John’s belly, coating his fingers—the finger with SHERLOCK scarred into it. A man’s name, and a different man’s come, and John
“Vickie’s leaving me,” the DI announced, apropos of nothing. Sherlock glanced at him out of the corner of his eye.
“I will speak with our mother,” Sherlock agreed.
“As in, hospital sick. As in, chemotherapy sick.”
The other end of the line fell silent for a long, telling moment. Then Mycroft clicked his tongue against his teeth, drawing a breath.
Clara was watching him again, in that unflappable way she had. “Do you want to find out? Find
To John’s surprise, Harry’s face softened. “I’ll try to be nice,” she said in a low voice.
It did not help, of course, that Sherlock’s soulname was so obviously male. So blatantly lower class. Sherlock wasn’t just a faggot—bad enough, really, but not exactly unusual—he was a fag destined to match well below his station.

“Well, were you out there when he started up?”
“Okay,” John swallowed. “Okay.”
“You want me inside you?” John confirmed. Helen made a strangled noise of consent, and then hooked a leg around his hips. John grinned, lined himself up with one hand, and then pressed himself inside her body in a long, smooth glide.

Lestrade and Sally turned to search the park, brows raised. It was evening, and rather cold, but that didn’t explain the empty streets. It was a neighborhood composed of disconsolate parts—rank alleyways, chained-up schoolyards, and paycheque advance establishments. Cleared out of foot traffic at the mere whisper of police presence. Not even the usual homeless camped out on park benches. A block of government apartments rose up across the way; now and again, a shade flicked aside, revealing the silhouette of a curious onlooker.

Mycroft hesitated. It was a pronounced pause, and Sherlock’s heartbeat sped up, in spite of himself. There was always

John pulled his finger free and reached toward the bedside table for a condom. He continued kissing Helen as he ripped open the packet, rolling the condom on carefully without looking. The motions were smooth and familiar, and they made John’s already hard prick jump in his hand. Helen pulled her knees up, panting, and John met her hazy eyes again before speaking.
“And what’s wrong with the landline?”
“That doesn’t mean anything. Some people can’t. And he dotes on her, you can tell.”
“Watson! On your six!”
“My mark came in when I was twelve. Vickie got hers at eleven. I’d only been twelve for three days when it happened, right? And Vic was so... God, she’s so beautiful. Funny. And we were both in our thirties already. My parents were gone, and I just thought... What difference does it make? Three days?”
“The name’s Sherlock Holmes.” John’s eyes went wide and laser-focused. “And the address is 221B Baker Street.” John opened his mouth to speak, but Sherlock winked at him—
“My soulmate is a boy?”
“Fine!” John finally shouted, then winced his apology to the couple sitting across the aisle. “Just calm down. Most people get quieter when they’re hungover, Harry. Doesn’t your head hurt?”
“If you die and Da lives, I’ll murder the bastard myself.”

It was stupid, thinking about that right now. About SHERLOCK. About John’s own obituary. He should be thinking of ways to get out of this, to find help, to save his own stupid, useless life. But the shot went through his left shoulder. Dominant hand. Too much damage for full mobility, and that’s if the nerves survived. Odds of a full recovery: slim. So.
) “Wasn’t a difficult leap,” Sherlock concluded.
“No,” Sherlock snarled.
“I know,” Victor answered. Always the same.
“Suit yourself,” the other man shrugged. “So long as you pay for the product and stay out of my way, it’s fine with me. You can play me something, once in a while—” Sebastian nodded toward Sherlock's violin case, clutched tightly in one hand. “None of that pretentious, new school nonsense, but your Vaughan Williams is nice enough.” Sherlock didn't reply.
“Not hungry,” Sherlock replied. Victor only smiled.
No. No, terribly unlikely. Mycroft tried to inform Sherlock of his soulmate’s death, nearly a year ago. He had, hadn’t he? Or was that quite right? Sherlock deleted the telephone call shortly thereafter, and couldn’t pull the exact details to mind. The likelihood was slim-to-nil, really, so what was Mike playing at? Sherlock’s lab gloves made texting difficult, but he found he really did not wish to remove them.
“I did.” It was too much. Sherlock thought he might pass out, which would be terribly lowering. He pulled his gloves off with shaking hands. His own soulmark (JOHN) was white enough to be nearly indistinguishable from the pale skin; Sherlock had tested countless lotions and whitening creams over the years. Nothing like the hyperpigmented scar standing out against John’s deep-set tan. He grabbed up his coat, abandoning the Work on the table, half-finished.
Clara shot him a wry look. “You’re more like Harry than I ever imagined.”
“Father Reid is gay as a picnic basket his own self,” Da said.
Nah. It's fine. Anyway we're talking about my brother!! Who still hasn't called!!!
Despite the man’s idiocy, and knotty morality, Sebastian Wilkes was the closest friend Sherlock had left, without Victor.
John swallowed. “Probably.”
“You can kip on the sofa for a while, but I’ve no room for a flatmate.” Sebastian eyed him with his particular sort of predatory smirk. “Only one bed.”
“I’m sure you’re all wondering why we’ve asked you to join us tonight.”
“Sherlock, I—”
Mike waved this away with a small laugh. “I heard you were abroad somewhere, getting shot at. What happened?”
“No, really,” she said, turning to look at him. John opened his eyes to look back. “That was
do you
James was on him so fast, John nearly blacked out. He had John’s zipper pulled down and his cock pulled out, and John hardly had time to feel embarrassed before he was pulling, twisting the erection through his calloused fingers.
when she had none at all. It’s not unusual for a name to come in the teen years. Joan of Arc, famously, did not receive hers until she was eighteen. Of course, they used that as evidence of witchcraft—”
. He pulled back the foreskin as he stroked toward the base, revealing a dripping head.
Sherlock nearly choked. “
The smile fell off Harry’s face, and she twisted her curly ponytail around one hand. “Da’s gonna kill you, isn’t he?”
“Your soulmate’s asexual?” Helen asked with a raised brow. “That’s extremely rare.”
“It doesn’t happen again,” James told him, tossing the towel to the floor. “Not unless you ask me for it. Not unless you
“By the open window,” John said. “Do you need a light?”
John moved, and it felt like the whole world moved with him. The world sharpened, focused, until the gun in his hands and the mud under on his feet felt like extensions of his own flesh. Like the run over boot-churned, uneven ground was what John Watson had been made for. Like he had a
The guests might have been willing to impose their condolences on Mum, but they were (wisely) giving both Watson children a wide berth. Gossip was meat-and-potatoes around here, and Harry Watson-Clarke was still infamous for her temper, as much as her unconventional soulmatch. John’s little sister shot the mourners brave enough to approach her a tight-lipped smile, and then went back to scowling into her drink.
“Oh, you’ve no idea,” Mike replied, ominously.
“Too posh for you? How come?”
“It’ll be all right, Johnny. Da will get over it. He’ll see you aren’t a fag.”
Rachel Watson disappeared down the back hall with rounded shoulders and a hand pressed to the wallpaper, as if she might collapse. John watched her carefully until she slipped into her bedroom, closing the door.
“Well, it’s hardly his soulmate’s fault, is it? If his parents aim too high?”
Mycroft ignored that. “Your intrepid inspector is due for a promotion. I suspect he’ll be made chief inspector within the year.”
Harry hummed a little, scrunching her face up in thought. “How you going to hide it, if Gran’s seen? Think she’ll keep it secret?”
“Oi, Freak!”
It felt oddly disloyal, thinking about his soulmate as he lay there. He didn’t owe James anything—they hadn’t been in the same room together for fourteen months—but it seemed like he ought to be recalling his face. His big hands. The way he laughed, almost in silence. John loved the self-conscious way he laughed.
“No, you’re not.  You’re just going to smoke cigarettes and
“It’s not a danger night, Lestrade,” Sherlock muttered, not altogether truthfully. “You needn’t be here.”
“You aren’t offered any courtesies, Freak. You’re eating my food and wanking in my shower. But anyway, Margot’s on leave from St. Mary’s for another two weeks. She’s the only fuck I’ll be enjoying until she takes off again. One more year,” he murmured wistfully.
John’s cane rested at a lazy angle against the edge of his desk. He rolled his injured shoulder, felt the pinch in the tight skin of the entry wound on his back. Ten months, and the damned thing still ached every morning. The stretches helped less and less in the frigid mid-winter weather.
John shrugged on his coat and double-checked that he’d locked The Drawer—the desk drawer with the unloaded service pistol John still hadn’t returned. It wasn’t morbid, despite what Harry thought. It was practical. It was an option. John didn’t have a lot of those, these days.
Fairly recently, John and James had become inseparable. James was the best friend John had ever known, though it embarrassed him to admit it. Their friendship would have raised eyebrows, anywhere but the army, and maybe it raised them anyway. John couldn’t be arsed to care.
Bill Murray used to call him “Wee Watson,” and John used to knock him around a bit when he did. Giant git. John really ought to reply to one of Murray’s emails, but he'd been avoiding anything with the
Sherlock tried to formulate a response, but there simply wasn’t one.
Mycroft wanted to know, his voice rising out of the clamor inside Sherlock's head.
, Sherlock? Bit cliché. You’re meant to be the imaginative one.”
Sherlock sighed and rolled his eyes. Boring. Sebastian grabbed a lone key off the hook near the door. “Spare key,” he said, tossing it to Sherlock. “Don’t lose it. And don’t bring anyone back here. You want to fuck anyone but me, you do it where I can’t bloody hear you.”
“Promise?” she whispered.
Sherlock turned back, drawing John’s gaze again.
“Drugs, maybe?” Lestrade offered. Sherlock pressed the heels of his hands to his temples.
“You’ve seen him,” Harry chuckled. “You going to buy makeup and perfume from
Eurus... well, Eurus was something else entirely. “Dangerous” didn’t begin to cover it.
“What were you doing after school, anyway?”
“Or close the wall up with our English dead,” John muttered, and then snickered madly. He bit his lip, guilty, and cleared his throat. “Right, sorry. Not the moment.”
. That was John all over.
one. Sherlock resisted the urge to rub his fingers across the four pale letters on his left hand.
“Don’t. Don’t
“Why?”
John felt something warm and dangerous settle into his stomach, and he grinned. He’d been chastised before for smiling like a maniac on the battlefield, but he couldn’t help it. “I’m nearly to Evans, sir,” he replied.
—which made the people around Sherlock frown and find other places to be. They were as natural as breathing, but not nearly so quiet. Mycroft had those, too, and Eurus took them far enough to be cruel.
“She’ll move back to London. I’ll finally take that awful banking job her father’s been trying to force on me for years. Couple of kids, maybe. Who knows?”
“Of course you did,” Sherlock muttered.
leanings.”
“Copy that,” Captain Sholto acknowledged. “Under two minutes.”
Harry sipped at her seltzer water with a little frown of distaste. Then her eyes went a bit vacant as her vision snagged on something across the room. John turned to watch Harry’s soulmatch, Clara, set down another tray of smallish sandwiches. “Do you know what Clara said,” Harry asked, “first time she met Mum and Da?”
The look that passed between his parents then was unreadable. Many such looks were, of course. Sherlock was still studying the language of face and body, and the sheer variety of data gave him headaches sometimes.
Victor was 20 years old, and behind Sherlock academically. If the younger boy weren’t trying for two concurrent degrees, he’d have graduated before ever meeting Victor Trevor. Perhaps that would have been best. The hard, compact lines of Victor’s body, his almost-unnatural calm, the flash of his white teeth when he smiled... Sherlock hardly knew what he wanted, but it seemed that Victor did. No one had ever looked at Sherlock with that kind of undisguised hunger. No one since Eurus, and this didn’t feel anything like her sort of predation. This felt hot and tight and delicious. This felt
“Really?” Sherlock frowned, walking away from them (from JOHN). “I thought it was a big improvement. Mouth’s too...
“Oh. Thank you,” Sherlock replied. He smiled at the shorter man—
“I couldn’t believe it when you made that goddamn shot,” James panted.
“Our friends will tell him,” Sherlock replied in a deadened monotone. “Better to warn him, in advance. You’re far more likely to be forgiven if he believes you’re forthright.”
“She’s okay?” John wanted to know.
Sherlock couldn’t help asking, “What?”
“Spit it out, John.”
“I’m busy tomorrow.”
“But—but that’s a boy’s name. John. I’ve never heard of a girl named John.”
“John!” The shout from the end of the hall sent them both to their feet. “Where’s your damn sister? You’re meant to walk her home!”
A long minute later, John rolled off of Helen onto the sweaty sheets. He pulled off the condom and tossed it into the small waste basket near the bed. Helen laughed a little, still raspy with sex and sleep. “Fuck, John. Thank you.”
“Visit.”
Sherlock snorted. “Unlikely.”
, is it?” Da chortled. John could feel his ears reddening, his pulse jumping in his neck. “Pretty thing? Curvy? Nice plump tits?”
“’Course she knows,” Harry scoffed. “Can’t exactly hide it, can I?
“Platonic, right?”
“I just mean—I didn’t—” He sighed, and clenched his fists. “I’m so damned sorry, Clara. I didn’t realize it got so bad.”
“She’ll blame me,” Sherlock said through tight lips. “She already does.”
, suddenly, that there was no coming back from this. John Watson wasn’t gay, but he was... well, something. Some
“Six minutes,” Han replied.
Father and Mummy glanced at each other again. They weren’t smiling. When Mycroft’s soulname came in, there had been cake and bright laughter at the dinner table. Sherlock was only four at the time, but his memory was excellent. He remembered the fond looks Mummy gave to Father then, and the taste of chocolate icing on his tongue. Mycroft refused to wrap the finger, despite the scabs.
“It isn’t Mum’s fault,” John said. Da’s narrow eyes settled on him instead, which was better. “Not my name, nor Harry’s. Nobody can change a soulname. And anyway, mine’s not romantic. I like girls.”
“No. It wouldn’t be.”
girls,” John bit out. His neck burned hot with humiliation. “I’d like to do more.”
“Sherlock-”
Sherlock looked up at me; his smile stretched in tenseness.
I look at him. Realize I am probably frowning.
''Can you flesh that out a bit more for me? In what ways is John concerned? Specifically? Hygiene? Sleeping?''
His breathing would have increased. Short puffs of air, as if he were having a panic attack. As if he could not extract enough oxygen from his environment.
One of the patrolmen had dropped their thermos upon taking in the scene, for Harrison's eyes had been so badly mutilated from the attack as to blur the orbital area into a red frothy pulp against white skin.
I take a seat across from him.
He exhales again. The same warmth against my skin. He smells like mint, and maybe cloves. Tea?
''You do, Sherlock! The fact that you can't do that is what is disturbing them. You must realize that!''
That he started taking lessons at four and a half?
I finally do let myself groan. Put my face into my comforter and groan at what's happening between us and the fact that I can't make heads or tails of it. Is it romantic? What John feels for me? And if it is, wouldn't I have known about it before now? And if it's not, why did he say he loved me? I'm not his child. I'm not his brother. Maybe John thinks you can love someone as a friend. In that Universal sense of love. Maybe that's all there is to it.
I haven't seen my brother in weeks. And while he looked sick then, he now looks...wasted.
Sherlock glances over at me quickly, then back at the bed sheet.
He hadn't been able to stay asleep for more than an hour at a time in weeks.
''I am not doing anything to you, Sherlock. Neither is John.''
Sherlock's eyes fill with tears and I immediately realize how he's taken my statement.
''And if that's part of the need here, I am ready to hear what you have to say. It doesn't have to be dark or an admission of something that troubles you, either. We can always talk, or watch a show, or do something fun. It doesn't have to venture into anything that could be a little too overwhelming for either of us right now. It could even be a hug. But I'd like to keep anything too intense, even kissing, off limits right now. Okay?''
He meets my eyes, and I see his un-padded heart spasm in his chest.
I hate it.
Lately, when John touches me at all - even though he only touches my hand, or the side of my face, or tends to a wound (usually acquired through an idiotic maneuver on my part, I'm sad to say), I feel a sinking sort of shame, and maybe even wounded. Hurt.
Molly lets out an exhale, pent up, and then asks, ''Do you want to call him? Let him know that you're here? That you're okay?''
The vast majority of the adult UK population, probably.
I get an image of me with a knife stabbing it into the Martian over and over and over and over. Ripping his guts out.
''Then what? What did I say? When? I can't make something better if I don't know what I did that upset you so much in the first place!''
John exhales sharply, looking stressed.
I have a million swirling thoughts, all vying for my attention right now. I have a hundred different things I could say to John – only, as with everything else these days – I don’t know if I want to talk, or if I want to remain silent. If I could wish for any one thing to really change, it wouldn’t be my weight. It would be my thoughts.
Sherlock fisted the material of my coat.
It's had been nearing 7 pm by the time we decided to call it an evening. The game itself was fast paced and interesting, but I failed spectacularly against Sherlock on all three games we played together.
And who wouldn't want such a man for a son?
I know I am also unreasonably angry at the shadow child.
When I finally get off the tube, I meander around for a few minutes. Then I walk down Harrow Road and past an orange-red library, with white window frames. Quite grand, all things considered, and it's at least three stories tall.
'Everyone' my ass. Mycroft can be such a pompous blowhard.
“You know the routine,” I say with a smile, indicating the beverages and tumbler cups.
out of honesty
I sense that it was a tentative agreement at best, though, hence John's hesitancy in answering. The start of his rambling.
It doesn't sound like a lot. It doesn't sound like very much. Especially not with an apology. And a somewhat-explanation.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
John is already awake. Of course he is; our roles seem to have reversed themselves in the last few weeks. Well, not exactly reverse, as such: he still sleeps a solid seven to eight hours a night, but I seem to be edging towards sleeping an obscene amount lately. Whereas I used to get perhaps five solid hours of sleep, on a good day, I seem to be edging closer to about 11 hours or more recently.
The inspector clears his throat.
No taste whatsoever.
''Oh, I hate this bit,'' I said awkwardly, and Sherlock huffed at my statement.
"I think it was...you know," his voice warbles and I nod.
Toby doesn't nod, and he doesn't speak at first. He just lets out a deep, heavy sigh.
---------------------------------
I've never seen him actually make himself a beverage before (aside from black coffee, Earl grey tea, or pouring himself the odd cup of water).
But, given everything that has happened lately - how could it not be?
Yuri takes another sip of his beverage. His eyes squish up in contemplation. Then he lays his hands down against the formica.
''Should I ask him...this? If any of this applies to him?''
The ketchup looks like blood.
I touch his shoulder.
''I do know that,'' I reply dully. ''Of course I know that.''
Peppermint? No - wintermint.
He seems to doubt my words.
and i told him that i am in love with him.
''Sherlock, what is it? What's going through that clever mind of yours? You can tell me. I promise, nothing you tell me is going to make me angry with you, or turn away from-''
It's not that cold. Not by a long shot, and yet Sherlock is currently dressed in an undershirt, a button down and a jumper, replete with his navy coat, his black gloves and his blue scarf.
'He is being taken to Maudsley. I will call when I have more information, John.'
I hesitate by the bed and then walk around the other side, crouching low by the frame. Sherlock's contorted himself into an almost fetal position. His eyes are crushed in upon themselves, as if willing to block out the light, the noise, the reality of the hospital.
------
---------------------------------------------------------------
“Well, I can see that John’s found our selection of teas. Are you sure you wouldn’t like to make yourself a beverage before we begin, Sherlock?”
The rush of something cold very much afraid courses through my head, and I feel almost faint with his revelation.
''If someone loved you back...would you leave them? If they didn't want to-, if they-,'' he starts.
''I'm just going to sleep for a bit, John,'' I murmur, my face heating up in shame. ''That's it.''
''Conquests?,'' he rasps, his mouth now almost upturned in a smile. The first of the evening.
''And you can?,'' I whisper. ''What do you even KNOW about it?,'' I ask rashly, a nanosecond later. ''You make these assertions! Like I am not being forthright, like I'm not trying!''
''Could we be any more British if we tried?,'' I quip, amused, reaching for a jar of marmalade while Mrs. Hudson laughs.
''You may not recall the events of last-''
Sherlock breathes out in a rush. I can hear something layered in the air.
''Mummy hurt my head,'' he says quickly, almost tripping over the words, and then: ''doango'awy.''
''I know you have,'' I reply, ''And I'm banking on your strength to hear me now. Because emotions are important, but they are secondary to your life. Your continued existence. And you've talked really well about a lot of what you feel - I know you have - but my fear isn't that you're not communicating with me, it's...''
Consider the minuscule little thumb print. The babyish whorls and ridges of the fingerprints.
''If I don't like it - we can leave?,'' I clarify, my voice slow and deliberate. ''At any time?''
The red band - denoting my penicillin allergy? That's fine. It's just a penicillin allergy. It's the rest of it that I hate. It's the black on white text.
Mrs. Hudson seems to lose herself in memories for a few seconds before speaking yet again.
---------------------------
After a few seconds of obvious deliberation, I hear the soft tapping of his feet against the linoleum, and then hear the bathroom door close.
I smile. ''Ah, so you admit it? Mycroft will be so pleased.''
I put a bag of art supplies near his bed, and he looks at the bag sceptically - as if it's a big, growling dog, and not simple brown paper. As if the items could bite him, or actually do him harm.
If I wasn't so alarmed by what Sherlock did not ten minutes back, I'd probably bark out a laugh.
''I'm sorry for calling him, I guess. I didn't mean to embarrass you,'' and my face feels flush. I suddenly feel badly in adding to Sherlock's sense of shame. Because it's normal to want to preserve your sense of dignity at all times, but especially during something involving such trauma. ''I just didn't know what else to do.''
''I wanted to make sure there wasn't anything else in there that you could hurt yourself with,'' I say strongly, not letting the look of upset on his face sway me from saying what I have to say. ''And until I found that, I thought you were only hurting yourself with sharp things. But that's not entirely true, is it? Damn it, Sherlock - is that why you haven't been eating?''
I come to rest under a large cluster of trees near a stop sign.
''I can come right away.''
You took a chance, John.
Civility, however, was light years away from Harrison McKenzie; the city lights might as well have been the distant light of stars from another galaxy, for all the hope they offered.
that everyone thinks is good.
John's voice: far away and tremulous.
I nod at the fridge, ''And how was your appointment? With Pascal?''
It's just John.
Yuri points at a blinking sign infused with neon halogens, and so I follow his glancing. See an image of a crow against a blood-red moon.
---------------------------------------
My throat is too sore for this. So I stop speaking, gather some spit in my mouth, swallow.
''You do need to look!,'' I exclaim, ''Absolutely you do! I won't make you talk about anything, or even force you back into therapy, but for God's sake, please, look!''
Perhaps he's afraid I'll be hurt by his words, or become frustrated in a manner similar to how I did before.
Rather than causing him to calm, however, my words seem to make his upset greater and the sound he makes becomes even harder to hear.
Ruiner.
''Okay? It's really okay? I'm operating in the dark here. I don't want to make things worse,'' he clarifies.
''John, it's not an obscenely-''
''I think that would be easiest,'' John says tightly, breaking the silence. His strained grin is back.
''What does that even matter? I'm allowed to have a glass of alcohol now and again!''
But that's the clincher, then: it's not so obvious at all.
His glands work, noisily swallowing, and his voice croaks when he replies in the affirmative.
Toby's mother pushes away from the table and moves to back of the room, her body quavering. Her voice is rapidly repressed as Sherlock approaches cautiously and assists her back to the table.
Sherlock nodded, his back to me, while I located my Dockers. When I was ready to leave, I muttered a ''See you around, then,'' and called Bisquick to my side. Sherlock kept a wide distance between me and the dog, and I felt somewhat confused by the interaction, but on the whole - intrigued.
Of course, that list could be rather voluminous.
''John?,'' he grits out, and I pour him a glass of water. Help him sit up and rest against the headboard.
Primary GP contact: Dr. John H. Watson, 44 20 7224 3705
''I think so. I don't know. How do you know if you love someone? And if you do, is it the same thing as being in love with them?''
''I don't want anything you can't give, and despite what Mycroft thinks or what you think, I'm not gay! Nor bisexual!''
Which means time was especially of the essence.
Moreover, the sting of their rejection was still newly painful and isolating, and the last thing I wanted to do was give an ultimatum to a friend who also seemed to be caught up in something equally painful and isolating.
Sherlock lets out an exhale.
Knowing he won't just drop in the streets.
But as a child?
''Sherl'ck, no,'' and he shakes his head again. ''C'nt tell.''
Especially when the person in question is as brilliant an actor as Sherlock Holmes.
John is shocked to learn that the abuse that Sherlock experienced is more emotionally complicated than he had previously considered. Mycroft provides sufficient details to fill in the gaps, and a warning too: Sherlock is not ready for a relationship. Sexual or otherwise. John is overwhelmed by the suggestion that he cares for Sherlock romantically.
The fact that he's so scared could break my heart, so I push that thought aside. It would be all too easy to go soft on him. To give in to the disorder, and to give in out of a misguided sense of wanting to protect him.
Which, obviously, it has.
My brain hisses 'nothing' and I sit back against her sofa, a strong pulse in my mouth now. Pounding away.
Sorry?!
He’s trying to be a helpful friend, and I’m countering his kindnesses with further reasons for why I am not a proper recipient for the effort. Then he pulls a book down from the shelf, cups it in his hands, and returns to the sofa.
John just stares at me, his mouth crumpled up. Like I've hurt his feelings or something.
The insanity here is that he truly sounds afraid.
Sherlock rested him hands, palm side down, gingerly, against Toby's torso. Keeping the child prone against the ground, as he was now trying to sit up, trying to sit up and move.
Sherlock hesitated, and then said in a rush: ''I can teach you, if you'd like? We don't have a large enough group of us to actually start a student's group - not yet - but-''
His face is heated and angry now.
Mrs. Hudson goes to pour me a couple more ounces of tea, refilling my cup up to the brim once more.
We walk the long way around the fence to get his treat, and as we do I hear the buzz of Sherlock's mobile. He tugs at it with his lean fingers, and reads the incoming message.
let the form vanish, until the pain vanishes. until everything vanishes.
''I'm sorry,'' he starts, as if on impulse.
Which is something I appreciate about Molly. Her sensitivity, and her respect.
''Even though alcoholism is an addiction?''
''What's going on, John?,'' Lestrade mutters a couple seconds later, and that's it. That one question is enough to grab hold of me - to make me realize what I'm actually doing.
''Your...friend,'' she gets out, almost choked, ''Sherlock - he knows things. About Toby.''
Sherlock shakes his head.
"He knows," he admits at last.
JOHN'S POV
What's more is that even now, as an adult, his attitude towards romance and more strongly - towards sex - remains almost chokingly hostile.
That he's considering the dynamic of my friend engaging so skillfully with a traumatized boy as being evidence for something more.
''You DO need someone to watch you! Do you think your behaviour is even close to being healthy? Has it EVER been healthy? Do you have any conception of what it means to take care of yourself? I just got you from the hospital following a suicide attempt, and you are wondering why I don't want you to be left around sharp objects? A razor blade? Are you bloody serious?!''
''What? What reasons?,'' he asks hollowly.
“I was very safe there,” he whispers, and I have to strain once more to hear the admission. “He never found me. Not once. Who would think that I could hide up on a curtain rod, anyway? It was peaceful and dark. Everything was blue from moonlight, and eventually I fell asleep high up by the ceiling, behind the venetians.”
But I get biscuits.
He looks both nervous and a little bit self-conscious.
I wanted him to fear the possibility of loss. Not the loss of my love, but the loss of us. As friends or...anything at all.
I wonder if this is how it is for Toby.
Because I haven't really cried in years. And I'm scared to cry. Scared for him to see that come out of me.
I must not look at myself in mirrors anymore. As fascinating as the experiment is, it keeps the unreality strong.
Toby nods and hands me the pages, both turned over to the white unprinted sides.
-------------------------------
And then another deeper, fuller thought inserts itself into the barely conscious portion of my mind.
Sherlock continues to stare at me: dead-eyed, face screwed up - mouth screwed up most of all - ears violet, shoulders hunched to his chin in discomfort.
The wording is odd.
Lestrade seems to make a decision at that point, and ushers Donovan and myself out of the room.
It serves only to infuriate me, as do all sense-memories when I can't contextualize the meaning behind their history.
''I-I,'' even his chest is rising and falling faster now, ''There is nothing wrong with me.''
His eyes continue to flutter, and for a second I am reminded of a man caught in the midst of a seizure.
''I think we need to talk now, John. Right now.''
Except that I do.
''Sherlock?,'' Yuri says gently after a few seconds. ''You still there?''
Because how do I accept that he knows? That he knows what he does, and look at him with anything approaching confidence?
''Twice a week? I don't think I will be needing your services twice every week, Doctor.''
but what else could i do?
Sherlock's mouth is moving, but no words are escaping.
Like I've been stung by a bee.
A fleeting smile passes my face, until I look around the room more; seeing knight and horse figurines arcing around the bed, almost in protective fashion. There are at least three night lights, and large towering bookshelves filled to the brim with all manner of picture books and - as I peruse - fantasy and science fiction novels.
''We're about to speak to Toby's mother. Do you want to be present for that, or have you had your fill of stuff today, Sherlock?''
Sherlock.
John is certainly not mundane. Anything but.
----------------------------
I pick up the tray and put it besides me on the bed.
''Don't be an ass, Sherlock,'' I grumble, and toss his bag to the bed.
While the first half of this story dealt with decline, this chapter starts in on actual ways John and Sherlock are going to move forward, and going to try to get Sherlock healthier - in mind, body, and spirit. Because of that, it's going to get more focused on discussions between the two of them (and also with Yuri, and Mycroft to lesser degrees) and revelations.
I pull the forms towards me. Give them a cursory read-through.
His breath is coming in rapid pulses, and he slips his scarf off from around his neck with misplaced agitation. In the next moment, Yuri looks over, his eyes settling in on the purple bruising, which has now slipped down a notch into something bluish and tinged with green mottling.
Sherlock squirms in his seat.
And absolutely no control.
The little head doesn't move, and the only sound is the breathing which he is obviously trying to regulate.
Please be warned - this chapter is more graphic than previous chapters, insofar as physical violence is concerned. It discusses the abduction and murder of a child in relative detail. Mostly taken from John's own inner imaginings and based on autopsy reports. But it might be upsetting to some of you, so please proceed with caution.

And yet, I could never cast the horror of my childhood off onto John. I'd have to be monstrous to even have a fleeting wish for a trade.
So really, the decision is already made, isn't it?
He's having a panic attack.
I try not to stare. I feel like I'm watching something far too personal. Something private, something that's he's not quite aware he's sharing - if only because he's still so sleepy.
Of course he doesn't know.
''Hell - I'm a dad. I have young kids myself. My youngest is around Toby's age. You know that I think, yeah? And when Sherlock told me what he suspected had happened - even when we first saw that body by the train tracks, just motionless? Bleeding and wet and how he looked like some little stuffed doll? The rain - everything - it just froze me, John. I couldn't stop thinking...'what if that was my boy?'' And I'm supposed to be good at separating my emotions. But I couldn't. Because some part of it was personal to me, in a way. Because Toby reminded me...of my kid.'
Sherlock breaks the kiss, and it makes a quick smacking sound. Light. It sounds cute.
It reads:
“Even children *shouldn’t* cry. It doesn’t solve anything. It’s a pointless activity!”
I never thought Sherlock was disordered.
-----------------------------
Not in the sense of eating, and gaining, and having me monitoring the process. Or blood work and tests and comments by others on the possible damage he's already done to himself.
''It's never felt this raw before. It hasn't hurt at all. I don't even think it hurt this much when it happened the first time. Why now?,'' and his voice is barely a whisper, as he looks at me - as if imploring me to help him make some sort of sense out of a situation that makes no sense at all. And never will make sense.
Because I am proud of him for having the courage to face any of this, never mind all of it. For continuing on through times that must have been so bleak.
Sherlock closes his eyes at that, seemingly calming down. After a few seconds, he opens his eyes again and ice blue meets my own with stunning fervor.
The image of me, as a child, running a blade over my wrist, humming ''Mary had a Little Lamb'' while crying comes to me immediately, and I step back from the table alarmed. Stare at the pealing blood as if dribbles over my wrist. Over my radial artery.
He looks at me in shock then, his voice sounding clear and much more awake now.
''Ready?,'' and John's voice is muffled as he lightly raps against my bedroom door.
===========================
Those are John's eyes.
''What makes it right, John? I mean, everyone always says it's good, or it's...beautiful, and to me-,'' and now I can see his breathing has accelerated, and he looks close to tears. ''I can't see that at all! It's ugly and it's bestial and its mindless. It's not good! Not to me! It's disgusting!''
John places his order after me and adds a croissant to the mix.
''John...I...I want to talk to you.''
''Yes, I will take both of those. The first one...Com Hen?,'' I test, knowing I'm probably bastardizing the pronunciation, ''can I get with scallions?''
When we finally leave, it’s with a bundle of nutrition guides and even more books on gastrectomies, along with a multitude of forms and ‘homework’ for our next appointment.
I glare at my mug. Wish I could topple the entire thing over through the power of my mind alone.
---------------
Sherlock rubs his hands against his lap.
“And none of this decaf nonsense,” I add, feeling somewhat lighter in this moment than I have ages. Interests? Disinterests? Favourite modes of exercises? Pastimes?
The only thing I know for certain - for absolute certain - is that I love him.
"I don't think you are bad now, either. If that helps you in any sense."
''What is Yuri going to say in his texts?''
I wince and put my head down against the side table.
He's LOST weight.
''I don't think Victor knows the first thing about how respectful relationships really work then, Sherlock. He certainly doesn't feel close to how I feel,'' I say crisply, needing to know that Sherlock will realize that I am not angry with him for posing the question. ''I would maintain that Victor and I see these things very differently. Never mind how to handle this subject with someone who has already suffered through hell,'' I grit out, and see Sherlock bite his lip. The action is so unlike Sherlock -that timidity in a man who at first seemed strangely boastful and over-confident when I first met him - that even his timidity is upsetting me now.
Molly...who has somehow motivated Sherlock to eat something when I couldn't get him to eat a cracker or take a sip of tea?
''I sent Sally back to the Yard,'' he says needlessly.
And as she touches his back, the child screams. It's loud and raucous and horrifying, but it does the trick: Mrs. Thiesen jumps back as if scalded by boiling water.
"What?," I test. I might not like the rawness of his tone, but I'll get further with him if he doesn't sensor himself right now.
But I never call Mycroft.
''I didn't punch anyone this time,'' he mutters, suddenly looking exhausted. ''I don't see how it matters now.''
A few seconds later, I hear the hiccuped sounds of John's voice coming in again.
I grab his hand.
And I do blame this on the absinthe, because suddenly I'm hugging him, and breathing deeply into his lanky torso, and I feel so many things. So many things, and the feelings I don't like - the ones you'd call 'bad' - are quickly being replaced by a feeling of connection, and a feeling of safety. And something that feels a hell of a lot like love.
'Most normal.'
I watched his hands. Off to the side. Not touching me. Not touching himself.
''Find *what* amusing?,'' I get out, frustrated and angry. For him. For Toby. ''Explain it so I can understand. I am not a mind reader. I can't do what you do.''
To hear it spoken about with so much freedom feels a bit like a slap in the face.
''It's Sherlock. He's - I don't know - Sally says he was holding his stomach, and we had to call A&E and-''
So I look up, and catch Yuri studying me.
''Alright,'' I say gently. ''I respect that, Sherlock. Whatever you can't do – that's okay. Whatever you can do – that's okay, too.''
''It's nothing,'' I whisper, upset at myself. Angry with my tormenting mind.
''How did you get up before me?,'' he asks drowsily. ''You've been going on empty for weeks now!'
''Why is this so hard? For me?,'' and Sherlock glances up at then, nervous distress clear in his eyes. They are grey-blue round moons, imploring me to make sense of it. Some sort of emotional sense, even though - of course - I can't show him logic in the illogic of his actions any better than he can.
Sherlock exhales, his chest rising. Even in the modest din of the space, I can see the tremulous way he expels the air.
''The light?,'' John clarifies. ''Would you like it on or off? I take it you have a headache?''
All of these things I think, but don't say.
She turns the lock and it opens with a 'pop.'
The light flickers on until the room is encapsulated in a golden glow. I lock the door - checking twice - before pulling off my sleeping garments and tossing them into a pile by the hamper.
''He hated me,'' I say in a rush. My eyes feel hot in my head. ''He must have hated me. Because I was just little then, John, so I don't understand. I don't understand why he hated me so much from the beginning.''
'Is that why you are scared?'
He stops his explanation.
I gape at John, gape at the mess of pasta and salt and pepper, and try to make sense of the almost meaningless words.
I close my eyes, feeling exposed.
Even though I know that thought is unfair, and very, very wrong.
Yuri jots something down on one of his canary yellow pads.
His question would likely sound like a euphemism to someone who didn’t know him all that well, and that would be an understandable belief - yet they’d be dead-wrong.
He hesitates.
We are making our way up the walk to Yuri's home, and Sherlock's posture has become brittle. His face is grey.
''You said his parents created a website to address his suicide. But this was an accident. His death was accidental!,'' he breathes, looking discomfited.
At Mrs. Thiesen's look, Sherlock abruptly stops talking, then looks to my left, then back down to the table.
He nods, finds his voice.
"You might not always understand your emotions, Sherlock, but don't try to tell me you don't have any. Emotions are part of what make us human..."
''Sherlock, we're not done ta-''
Hell - his whole identity is probably linked to those sick events. His sense of self, of where he fits in, whether or not he accepts the label of freak, his reluctance - no, his downright mockery - of even the construct of sexual relationships.
''You got this filled three days ago,'' Sherlock determines, glancing back to me.
He is trying. I know he is.
"I need to- I need to get back home."
A glance in my direction - full of confusion. And then a desolate breath, as if exhausted that he even needs to explain.
''But I think maybe, John, maybe if I-''
''Can you help me open these packages, please?,'' he asked, and I noted the vulnerability in his voice as he passed his first aid kit over to me.
I was 36 years old, and felt as terrified as when I had been 12.
“Just thinking. Of developments,” he drawls in his baritone voice.
His eyes shut. They shut hard. He looks even more distraught now and not less.
Silence.
Protection.
But I can't tell that to John.
"I don't think you were obstinate. I think you were frightened."
I wonder if that's what derealisation feels like. Except, without end. A sense of deep, profound disconnection from human love and connection. Surrounded in only blackness, and night. The endless state of being alone with your fears, your shames. No warmth, no connection to offer any hope. Nor make the burden lighter to carry.
"Did he ever get help?," I ask suddenly, needing to know. Needing to hear the answer.
-------------------------------------------------
''This overwhelms you too?,'' and I try not to hug him with his admission.
Right there, in bold lettering. Telling the entire world of my problems.
“Has Yuri informed you of the “additional issues” as they pertain to Sherlock?,” he asks carefully, unsure of how much to reveal without my say-so.
''What is it, Sherlock?,'' I test quietly, knowing Mycroft is in the kitchen, trying to give us space. Also knowing that despite the tinkering sound of him busying about in the other room, making tea or taking sugar out of the sugar-bowl (again, likely for tea), he still has almost preternatural hearing. And while he can surmise all he wants about our relationship, I am not going out of my way to divulge information that Sherlock himself is still trying to process.
And not. In some ways - things are running better. Smoother. He's picking up after himself, he's washing his dishes. He's gone to Tesco for milk and creamer. So in some ways things seem better.
Because I have already texted John.
''Ok,'' I breathe, feeling a spark of delirious happiness that to the rest of the world would seem out of proportion to what is really going on.
He certainly didn't put up much of a fight now - did he?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Our sandwiches are going cold, and that's all my fault too.
"Sherlock. Please stop."
I freeze in place.
Try to order what I should say and how I should say it, before starting in on this conversation.
It wasn't even about intimacy, it wasn't about the subject I suspect he hates beyond all else. I needed to shock him out of his hazy world of lingering about, poking about for a glass of water here, an aimless walk there - all while he's starving and living off ketones and using up his own bloody heart muscle as a fuel reserve.
It was clawing at my cranium, and I knew it, and I knew it made everything slow down and grow dim and fuzzy and somehow hurt less in the physical activity of hurting more. I knew what is was, and even so - I let it back inside.
Sherlock's scrapes another bit of yogurt from the bowl and while internally I'm cheering, externally I don't want to come across as a push-over. He's eating, thank God, but he's still lazing about when he should be out of the flat and on his way to see his psychiatrist.
“Sherlock! How are you, my friend? What would you like? It’s on the house, for you and your date.” The man grins and gestures towards John.
“Would you be bothered if I played the violin?”
“I’ve asked you to stop calling me that” John turned away from his sister in hopes of having her miss the blush that crept up his face. Why was he blushing about Sherlock-fucking-Holmes? God.
“You’re bleeding. Under the sink in the bathroom there’s bandages, help yourself.” The brunette dips his head back into whatever the hell he was doing earlier.
“You have a psychosomatic limp, it wasn’t hard to find the little shop you ate at this morning. Now, I want to take you out for dinner. I’m paying.”
“To dinner? What, like a date? I’m not gay, you know.” John took his cane from Sherlock’s grasp and let his fingers touch Sherlock’s, just slightly. Just for a little bit too long. John quickly busied himself with adjusting the length of the cane, even though he and Sherlock both knew perfectly well that it didn't need adjusting.
“-If I find one bullet hole in my wall you can find somewhere else to stay, you hear me?” The woman turns around and smiles at John. “Oh! You must be Sherlock’s new boyfriend! It’s so lovely to meet you, dear! I’m Mrs. Hudson, your landlord, not your housekeeper, mind you.”
“221B Baker street, 6:30, tonight. Come only if you’re interested in living with me, we could split the rent comfortably. Also, I have a feeling you’re not the kind of man to simply ‘forget’ about that tattoo we share. See you then, John.”
“Nothing important.” John murmured reaching to open the door, pausing when Sherlock steps in front of him opening the door. Sherlock Invites him out with the raise of his arm.
“One step at a time … .” John chuckles to himself at the bad joke. He makes it up the stairs and finds Sherlock rummaging through stacks of papers, scribbling furiously onto different ones. John decides to knock. Two knocks with the back of his knuckles should do it. Sherlock looks up, his eyes scanning every bit of John.
“What is stopping you, John Watson.” Sherlock asked John, but with no hint of a question in his voice. “What is stopping me?” John thought to himself. Nothing. Nothing but his own distrust of the situation.
“Yes.”
“Obviously.”
No one moved. John's phone was ringing, but no one decided to move away. Sherlock remained cold and still, and John suddenly realized the situation that he was in.
John let’s himself be guided by Sherlock to the door of Angelo’s. It’s a small and quiet place, and the atmosphere is very….. cute. A large, bearded man walks up to Sherlock as they sit,
“You … you need your cane though.”
What had even happened today? Honey combs? John lightly traced the hexagons on the back his hand, faintly remembering the beautiful color of Sherlock’s eyes. What? No. Not beautiful, Sherlock Holmes was a nutter and he was not beautiful. Definitely not gorgeous. John’s thoughts wandered to Afghanistan, to the man he once kissed. It only happened once. He was his friend, Everyone called the man O’Riley, though he once was close enough to him to just call him Thomas. John wondered if Thomas ever thought about him like this. Probably not, everyone knew O’Riley was a player, John wasn’t special.
“Afghanistan.” He licked his lips and smiled only with his mouth, not his eyes, a sort of defense mechanism. “I came home just a little over two months ago, this mark appeared very shortly after. What about you, Mr. Holmes? What were you doing one month, three weeks and two days ago, then?”
“I never agreed to live here.”
“Alright there, blondie. I’ll go grab you two menu’s and a candle.” The man winked and happily walked off.
“Mr. Holmes is my brother, do not call me that. My name is Sherlock.” Sherlock sneered “I was working on a case, a murder where the murderer could apparently ‘fly’, but it was really just the secretary,” John looked confused. Sherlock rolled his eyes, “Your dull brain won’t understand, it’s fine, I was doing what I always do. I am a consulting detective. Now what do you think of this ‘tattoo’, John Watson?”
John smiled, lightly letting out a half hearted chuckle as he lowered his gaze to the floor. “I was putting a person back um, back together. He had been,” John let out a small and sharp sigh, “been um blown up, mostly. Torn to pieces. I was in-” “-Afghanistan or Iraq?” Sherlock cut in. John hesitated.
“Down the hall.” Sherlock gestures to the direction. He continues, “Oh and um, that.” and nods towards where John’s cane leans against a wall. John picks up his cane and heads towards the bathroom. He opens the door and looks around. He opens the cabinets below and finds a random assortment of poisons and harmful chemicals. Carefully moving past those, his hand reaches to a small, red little first aid pack. Bandages. He removes his pants and cleans the dressings that the medic applied earlier. Drenched in dark blood, he threw out the old rags and cleaned the wound. He was used to this, it hurt but he took it. A bit later, his wound was clean and redressed. He put his trousers back on and looked at himself in the mirror. He looked tired, not bad, but tired.
“Are you a virgin.” John calmly asks as if he’s commenting about the weather. Sherlock freezes and John witnesses the massive derailment that he has just caused.
“Same with mine.” Sherlock muttered, though John couldn’t tell if he was talking to him or to himself. What had he gotten himself into? John thought about the dreams he had been having, the voice of a man, Sherlock’s voice.
“Blush away, Johnny boy.”
“Uhh.. thanks.” John says awkwardly, moving into the hallway with a blush still bright on his cheeks. “What was that about?” John thoughts wander as he starts to move down the stairs. Did they almost kiss? Did Sherlock notice that too? John loses his thoughts as he stumbles on the steep steps. The only thing saving him from falling down the rest of the way was Sherlock’s hand grabbing his left shoulder tightly.
“Which was?”
“I have dreams too.” Sherlock says, keeping eye contact with the purple petals.
John warily steps out of his chair and puts on his coat, he wasn’t drunk but he wasn’t sober either. Where will he go now? Sherlock’s? God, no. Harry’s, he supposes. He doesn’t want to but he has nowhere else to go. Sherlock seems to be in a similar state that John is in.
“You play?”
“What were you doing before the tattoo appeared? What were you thinking about, who were you talking to, everything.” Sherlock’s eyes narrowed as he searched John, deducing little bits about him. Military doctor, psychosomatic limp, alcoholic brother, possibly?
“Sherlock Holmes, was it? Alright, how in the bloody hell is this possible. I haven’t ever gotten a tattoo, I didn’t get this one myself, it was just … there.” Sherlock’s brows furrowed for a moment before relaxing. Sherlock stood quickly and paced around the flat wordlessly.
“No, I’m not special at all.” he muttered. The kettle hissed and John turned to noise. He picked up a rag and used it to hold the kettle’s hot, metal handle. Rag or not, it wouldn’t have mattered because John nearly spilled the boiling water everywhere. Out the window, out in the garden, Sherlock Holmes stared at him from behind a raised bed of growing tomatoes. John set down the kettle on the stove and slowly reached to open the window. Sherlock quickly walked over to the now open space between them.
“Incredible. You truly are a psychopath.”
“What … but I don’t want to be your flatmate.”
“Yes you did. You came by today.”
“Bloody bastard.” John mumbles to himself, climbing to the cab next to the taller man. Definitely not noticing how Sherlock’s longer legs caused their knees to touch.
“You are the one performing experiments, now? Funny. May I ask the goal of the experiment?”
“Oh. Oh. That’s what you meant? My cane?”
“221B Baker Street, please.”
“Did you…” John bit his lip and glared at Sherlock for a moment. “Did you fucking stalk me all the way home, Sherlock Holmes?” Sherlock cleared his throat and his eyes darted around, just for a small moment.
“Why am I actually considering going to that loons flat? Living there?” John whispered to himself as he put his now room temperature kettle back on the stove.
“Yes, we need it. Nice to meet you Mrs. Hudson.” John awkwardly smiles before shuffling upstairs. He opens the door to Sherlock’s flat.
“Dinner?” Sherlock's voice was a bit lower than usual, though John couldn’t place why. John looked up and his nose nearly grazed Sherlock’s lip.
He walked back downstairs and caught Sherlock’s gaze. He was laying on the couch, but his head was raised enough for him to look around. Sherlock studied John for a moment, and then another moment, and another.
Hello, we're so sorry that we didn't post chapter 5 today! Thing's have been so busy in our lives but the chapter is very close to being completed. We both are amazed at the kudos and hits and we love your support. Thank you all, and yes we will be posting more chapters very soon. - Love Hotdog and Golem.
“My brother hired you. He’s spying on me through you, that’s what this is …. That’s ..” Sherlock’s breath became unsteady but only for a moment. John glared at Sherlock. “What am I doing here?!” John stood to his feet and limped towards the door.
Flinching in pain, John pulls Sherlock’s hand off his shoulder. Holding a hand over the barely healed hole in his shoulder.
“Why did you almost kiss me?” John blurts. Sherlock’s eyes widen and dart to meet John’s. The brunettes mouth opens as if to say something, but quickly shuts.
Making sure the bathroom was clean from any blood, he leaned on his well needed cane and closed the door behind him. He had gotten through today without his cane, but he wouldn’t try it again.
“Experimenting?” John’s brows furrow and he leans in just a little, a bit of annoyance bubbling to the surface.
“Well you could have just asked me if you wanted to be my flatmate, John.”
“I came to apologize.” Sherlock said, his eyes still cold, though by the state of his awkward body posture and the change in pitch of his voice, John could tell he was trying. John remained silent, trying to get Sherlock’s gaze to meet his own. “I’m trying to cut back on smoking. Choking you was not ideal.” Sherlock let out a puff of air, as if what he said was extremely taxing.
After a very fast shower, John grabs his coat and yells, “Harry! I’m going out! Don’t wait up!” John strides out the door and hails a cab.
Sorry its a bit later than expected! - Golem
“Right, thank you.” John nods slightly and realizes he doesn’t know where the bathroom is.
“I never agreed to live with you!” John's voice grows impatient.Harry groans, “Oh God, my head.” John turns to look at Harry, shuffling to her feet from her spot on the floor. When he turns back around to face Sherlock, all he gets is the raised garden, empty of his arrogant, sociopathic consulting detective. What the hell was that anyways? John had never heard of anything like that before. What the bloody hell had he gotten himself into? John thought once again.
“You forgot something.”It read. John pauses. His cane. “Idiot! Watson, how did you survive Afghanistan…” John mutters and shakes his head. Deep breath. He opens the door and steps inside. A small woman with lighter brown hair has her hand on her hip, standing at the bottom of the stairs and in the middle of yelling something up the steps. All John could make out was the end of the sentence.
“Beautiful flower, that is.” John and Sherlock both say quietly. John looks to Sherlock, a bit shocked.
Chapter three: Tea and Teases. 3:18pm.
“—it behooves you to stay in Detective Inspector Lestrade’s good graces.”
“Not a word,” Mike breathed. He watched the pair of them like it was Wimbledon finals.
“Just his usual shit,” John confirmed, making space for her by folding up his feet.
“Then you’d be better off buying a fancy dog. Take it on promenades around Jesus Green. Buy it one of those ridiculous bejeweled collars.”
John nearly smiled, and it felt
,” John hissed. Harry scrambled to comply. John went to the door and leaned his back against it, bracing his feet on the floor. “She had tutoring, Da!” John called back. His voice barely trembled. “I’m meant to fetch her at 5 o’clock!”
