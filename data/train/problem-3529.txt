Dean thinks as Cas kisses him deeper and deeper, hand braced on the wall above them, breath heaving like a rolling boulder in his chest.
Castiel remembers -
“You see that?” Dean says as he disengages from where he was resting on the wall. “The snark on that kid. Who the hell is teaching him that?”
He absentmindedly takes a bite of the baked beans and grimaces at the texture.
“Ready?” Dean says, and Cas nods.
“Hey Cas,” Dean says, crossing his arms and then thinking better of it and putting them in his pockets. He then leans against the doorway of the library. “What are you reading?”
Not that Dean didn’t look at him before. Sam and Jack and even
“Okay,” Cas says. They wait in the kitchen as the buns toast, staring at each other. There was always a reason to look away before. There is none now. Cas is allowed to look at Dean for as long as he likes, and he looks, and he likes what he sees.
“I need you, Cas,” Dean says. And it is the truth. No one would look at the way Dean Winchester is pleading with him and disagree. “Please. Here with me.”
I’m sorry, Dean.
“You’ve been busy,” Cas surveys.
Maybe this is what escaping Hell felt like, Dean thinks, and closes his eyes. Must’ve not been so bad really. If you think about it.
The asset searches up Castiel Novak’s name as soon as he can get to a library, but first he has to become human again.
“What’s up?” Dean says. Cas is wearing a polo shirt and khakis, both from the thrift store. They both fit him reasonably well, which in this bunker, basically means it’s not unlike a latex body-suit. Dean swallows and tries to look directly at Cas’ face for this entire conversation.
The man asks, “You know me?” Castiel wants to deny it, but it would be fruitless. Yes, he wants to say. I’d know you if I had no eyes to see.
With a new relationship, there are always ground rules that you have to lay out before you can do anything fun. The majority of this process is unsexy and unsatisfying, dancing around boundaries and proverbial quicksand, snagging a tripwire without realizing and triggering a whole afternoon of cold shoulders. What Dean and Cas have on their sides is time, which helps. Dean knows Cas doesn’t like fancy ketchup, and Cas knows what to do when Dean has a nightmare, which is to let him lock himself in the bathroom for forty minutes and hug him when he comes back out.
"Nowhere far," Dean shrugged, "just away from here."
As soon as the words leave Jo's mouth, Eileen makes a pained noise and her hand lands on Dean's shoulder, squeezing his soul out of his body.
“Fuck,” Dean grabbed Cas's hand and pushed through the crowd. "Where'd they run off to now?"
Sam cleared his throat and Castiel ducked his head, leaning away from Dean even when he didn’t know why he felt like he had to do so.
“Not everyone shares your enthusiasm when it comes to sex.”
“Guys, lay off him. He’s tired.” Dean snorted, seeing the confused and slightly terrified expression on Cas’ face.
"He's a little impulsive, but once you know him well, you would know he's a hero." Castiel says, defensively, looking over at the sleeping form of his lover. Dean looks peaceful, his face smothered into the pillow to the side, lips slightly parted. Dean fell asleep as soon as he went to bed, tired from not having rested for days on end, and Castiel feels guilty having pulled Dean into a mess that should have stayed as Castiel's own problem.
After what could’ve been hours, Dean cleared his throat. “We’d love to keep talking but we’ve got to go find my brother. It was great meeting you guys,” he said, his hand coming to rest around Castiel’s waist albeit possessively. It’s not the first time throughout the night Dean had done that but Castiel’s skin lit up on fire just the same. Dean nudged him, “Come on, sweetheart.”
Terra whipped her gaze up, frowning, "Do you think this was a murder?"
"If you're referring to my grace, no, it's not."
"Give me a minute," said Nadia, the line going on hold. A few seconds minutes later, she was back on. "She's at the morgue right now. Her shift ends at four."
Sam laughs softly coming to stand next to him, and Dean realizes he's got tears in his eyes, "Dean, meet Eleanor Mary Winchester."
“Sounds like a plan,” Dean says. He comes around to Cas’ side to peek at his screen. Cas, the teenage girl he is, moves the screen away so Dean can’t see.
“Soup’s on!” Dean calls to the room, having relieved his bare hands from burns. He slaps his hands together and gestures to the food in a
“Ah, sleep when I die, right?” Dean says. He gets a sudden feeling that he’s jinxing something. “Just tell me where to go.”
“Dean?” Castiel forced himself to say, squinting as Dean hurriedly undid the straps holding him down. “What happened to you?”
They wait, looking at each other. This seems like non-standard questioning.
Then he left the frontlines in the middle of the night to rescue his little brother and his childhood best friend’s platoon from capture behind the front line. The asset remembers the intense coughing that set in amongst the prisoners, then being strapped to a metal table and injected with venom and electrocuted for hours. He remembers crying and soiling himself and screaming to God that He had abandoned him and the world in general. And then.
“It was a very nice bar,” Cas says, smiling subtly. With Cas, it’s mainly in the eyes.
“Yeah, Cas, whatever you want,” Dean says, feeling vaguely like he got punched in the chest.
“I wasn’t aware that’s a power I possess,” Cas says, squinting.
Their fur is very soft. He watches them crawl, one by one, towards him, snag a piece of grain, and disappear. One in particular is smaller than the rest, with fawn colored fur and intelligent black button eyes. She grabs a piece of grain and instead of dashing away, she sits by his hand and eats as much as she dares. Castiel knows better than to get attached 一 although, does he? 一 so he mainly watches with adoration from afar.
“For sure,” Dean says. “Yep.”
“Sorry for that, Mr, Novak. I was unprepared for the scope of your injuries,” Dr. Kerubin says, voice only slightly shaky. “Your shoulder has been crudely assembled and put on with no respect for your well-being. I am frankly surprised that you’re conscious right now, let alone talking normally.”
After everyone leaves, everyone else goes to the Dean Cave to watch Lost Boys, and Cas lays his head on Dean’s collarbone and Dean spends the whole movie drawing figure eights in Cas’ arm hair, lost in thought.
Most of Cas’ usual groceries; labneh, steaming slices of tahdig, wildflower honey, artichokes, vegetarian samosas, tall, frothy jugs of horchata he gets for free because the lady there likes him; comes from the farmer’s market, but Dean has caught Cas slamming shitty, factory-made cinnamon buns at midnight too many times to overlook it, so he buys them. Or whatever. They disappear within a few days, so Cas must know they’re for him.
“Hey, buddy,” Dean says, like he’s trying to talk someone out of defusing a bomb. “What are you doing?”
“It appears like she wants short-ribs,” Cas says, checking his phone one more time before slipping it back into his jeans.
A deal concerning his happiest moment is so far from his consciousness that it’s like a deal concerning him turning into a dinosaur. Simply impossible. Not worth analyzing.
He and Cas have a lot of non-conversations. Dean doesn’t really mind. He would talk about the weather for hours if that means Cas would be right there next to him, pointing at the clouds and saying it looks like rain.
“We should make it back soon,” Cas says, eyes averted. Dean wonders where the line was, where he crossed it. “I hear we have Blizzards waiting for us.”
He pauses that train of thought. Perhaps this was always the way it was meant to end for him. He doesn’t think he’s meant for domesticity, the way the old alley cat he used to feed never got quite used to being held.
biologically mine, but she’s not—,” Cas flounders. He wishes, not for the first time, that Dean was here with him, fielding the small talk with his smile and his knowledge of human interaction. “She was my… brother’s daughter. Before he passed.”
“Huh. Yeah. Well, I don’t have else much to do,” Dean chuckles, looking almost bashful. He watches Cas out of the corner of his eye, like he might disappear if he looked away. Ten years ago, Cas might've, overcome with an emotion he couldn’t assign a name to.
In order to make a really good apple pie, you need to do a couple of things.
But they are over there. He is in here, in a pressure cooker with what he thinks might be the Love of His Life, his kid brother, their kid, and his dog. Forgive him.
“I will,” Cas says, rescuing him from his head with another Dean-smile. Dean feels aching in his chest so deep he’d have to dig to get it out. He’s pretty sure it hurt more ignoring it every day for years that this — this acknowledgment of it —  just feels like a relief.
“Is this going to be enough for everyone?” Dean says, wiping his hands on the dishtowel he has resting over his shoulder. “Better than nothing, right?’
The asset remembers laying his hand on Dean’s shoulder, his uniform so ripped to shreds that he could put it on bare flesh . The body underneath it has never been familiar to him, but he thinks this blood is.
He leaves before they fire the shot.
Cas, oblivious to Dean’s dilemma, switches the car off and pulls out the keys, handing them back to Dean who pockets them, and then he starts his breathing routine. Dean waits patiently.
“Hm. Do we have any tuna salad left?” Jack says, yawning behind his hand. He’s been sleeping most of the days away since he came back after receiving and then relinquishing God duties. Turns out that kind of intense power takes it out of a kid. Who knew.
“Jesus, baby,” Dean says, trying to move himself to the middle of the seat. “You’re going to kill us.”
Dean thought he had categorized his feelings for Castiel pretty accurately, although it had changed over the years. They had gone from “potential enemy” to “sort of friend” to “betrayer” to “best ally we’ve ever had” to “best friend” and that signifier of best friend should’ve been Dean’s first clue. Men like him don’t have best friends, he thinks. John didn’t have one, and that is Dean’s barometer for normalcy, God help him. But looking at Cas, he decided that “best” was the only descriptor for him. Closest friend. Man you worry about constantly. Talking to Cas didn’t feel like conversations with Garth or Charlie did. Dean put him to the side, categorized him differently, he’s not like those other chumps. His best friend.
he admonishes himself, willing himself to stop his trembling.
Dean notices him tensing and physically relaxes his shoulders, his stance. Cas watches this carefully. Old habits die hard.
Sam clears his throat. Dean pauses his internal monologue to look over his shoulder, where Jack is looking over Sam’s research quietly and Sam is making the biggest
“Especially when it comes to boyfriends or girlfriends. He always said that the more you posture, the more defensive you look and the more everyone loses. You always have to play it cool when you’re forging that relationship,” Ellie says, wrapping the meat carefully.
He looks up at Cas then, either to check that he’s still listening or gauge his reaction. Cas smiles very gently back at him. Dean seems taken aback for a second and then quirks up a side of his mouth, turning back to the table.
“It’s fine, Jack. They can know,” Cas says, and they all turn to watch him walking in. He’s glued to a small book, and he’s got a pencil in his hand. He’s either playing Sudoku again or a crossword, whatever he’s not done yet. He finishes a whole book of them in about a week if he’s feeling sharp. “I’m making Shepherd’s pie.”
“Hello, Dean,” Cas says.
“Oh, real mature,” Dean says, and Cas does the Cas equivalent of sticking his tongue out at him, which is to smile very, very slightly. It’s exhilarating.
“Yeah,” Dean said. “Yeah.”
Cas nods. “Dean, you don’t have to say anything. I just wanted to make you sure where our positions stand. It’s okay if we never talk about it again.”
Cas raises his eyebrows. Dean raises his back.
Cas hums quietly along to the whole song next to him, lit by the streetlamps like they love him. Dean knows the feeling.
When they tell Sam, he shrugs a shoulder and continues reading something on his iPad. Dean throws one of Cas’ decorative pillows at his head. They go out later and buy more pillows and conditioner and a single tea towel.
So there he is, leaning against the kitchen island. He is scuffing the tile below his feet. He is holding a beer but is not drinking it. He is feeling horrifyingly, spectacularly sorry for himself. It was stupid, he shouldn’t have even
Once, Castiel Novak was on a mission in the dead of winter in 1945. He was once on a train dangling above the waters of the Danube, on a mission Dean and Sam had planned. Castiel Novak had felt himself growing more strange with the passing days, the quiet knowledge that his captors had stolen some essence of humanity from him and that he could not recover it no matter what he tried.
“Dean, I,” There are tears in Cas’ eyes. Oh, Jesus. Well, they match the tears in Dean’s. At least they are both two idiots crying in a Costco.
Castiel Novak had been drafted for the war in ‘42. He, along with Sam Winchester, had been sent to the Western Theatre while Dean was left behind. This was the catalyst for the force that was Captain America - Dean’s fear of abandonment, the guilt of not dedicating his life to the cause, the uselessness of his own body not being good enough to fight.
“I came back early,” Castiel says. He thinks if he adds another smile it’ll be too suspicious, so he keeps his face passive. “I actually came here to check out the -,” Castiel tries to think of an ingredient Dean has mentioned before and it’s all blank until, “The shrimp.”
It’s not that hard. There are many things Castiel chooses not to think about. He doesn’t think about the swathes of angels that he has killed for good reasons and for bad, the brothers and sisters he’s killed without second thought He doesn’t think about watching Kelly Kline love the thing that will eventually kill her, how he promised to take care of her precious son and then died.
“Dean, as I’ve said before, you had no reason to believe I was even alive. You wouldn’t have been able to find me even if you knew where to look,” Cas says. “What’s past is past.”
Dean looks at him for a long moment more and then slumps against the cart in thought. “I guess we could have shrimp tonight. Hell, maybe even shrimp scampi. The kid hasn’t had that yet.”
“Yes,” Cas says. “When I told you I love you.”
“Consider it given,” Cas says.
“That’s Kaia. Wasn’t sure if you guys have met,” she says, pointing behind her with her thumb.
Castiel does not know, but he thinks it’s endearing that Dean thinks he does.
They stand there for a while, haloed by fairy lights and sung to by the whooshing sound of the pond filter. Cas is the first one to pull away. Someone’s always gotta leave.
It’s not like the thought didn’t cross his mind, especially as he heals more completely. What remains of his arm is fully healed and he is getting used to life using only one arm. The phantom pains, as always, hurt and he gets less sleep than is prescribed, but he is hopeful for his future. For once.
This particular day, Cas had been watching Maury when Dean knocked on the Dean Cave door and forced him to sit at the dining room table with him.
with you.”
“Uh, sure,” Jack says, clearly unaware of what exactly the SuperBowl is. “He said he might need my help mashing later.” He looks pained, his thin shoulders hunching suddenly. “I don’t think I was supposed to tell you that.”
“I could—,” Dean’s voice wavers. “I could ask if you didn’t leave.”
He makes eye contact with the fawn-colored rabbit hiding in a chokecherry bush. It looks at him like it can’t tell what he is, whether he be human or angel or animal. Not a threat apparently. Castiel takes some solace in that.
“You’re very handsome,” Castiel says. Dean looks like he’s battling between laughing and yelling and crying, so he just looks at the floor of nothingness in the Empty and ends up halfway smiling. The blood makes his teeth red. It’s… compelling.
“Ah, keep it on,” Castiel says, looking down at his feet. “Better to see what I’m doing.”
, and the asset exhales hard before clicking it.
“Jack?” Cas says, abandoning his salad and rushing over to check on him just as the other two come over too. Jack wordlessly holds up his hand, showing the inch-long cut slowly unfurling on his thumb. It’s not gushing blood, but it’s not pretty. Sam and Dean hiss in sympathy.
“Uh,” Dean says, before looking at him. “When you-?”
Cas never really sticks around. Dean knows this.
“Haven’t had Shepherd’s pie in years,” Dean says dazedly. He was holding bananas in his hands when he heard. He twists them this way and that as he thinks.
Dean thinks about how telling Cas will go many times a day. He thinks about slamming Cas into a wall, breaking his nose, kissing him lights-out. He thinks about taking the book out of Cas’ hands and sinking into his lap. He
“You want to watch the movie,” Cas says, looking for confirmation. For some reason, Dean is terrified he’ll say no. Even though he knows for a fact that Cas isn’t doing much else. He nods.
“Yeah, Cas,” Jack says, scrubbing something out of his eye. “Was just worried, is all.”
There are still ghosts. There are still monsters. Dean teaches Cas to fight hand-to-hand, even when it frequently dissolves into them gleefully rubbing up on each other. Sometimes, Cas comes up to him and puts his fingers down one-by-one on this collar, and he is suddenly very aware he is the happiest he’s ever been.
“Hiya,” the man says. He’s British, with a tone that seems overly familiar. He leans on the box casually, like they’re making small talk at a bar. Cas doesn’t even look at him.
When they asked him to do it four more times, he hesitated less each time. Once, he rested his hands around the proxy’s neck and held his handsome face in his hands for a long time before he snapped his neck. Too much kindness, Naomi said still, looking over her glasses at the silent Castiel in front of her. Remove it.
“Cas, I regretted sending you out the second I did it and I regret not taking you back with me the second I could’ve,” Dean says. He’s looking directly at Cas now. “I regretted letting you walk away from me the second I did that too. We want you here, buddy. Sam wants you here.” He takes a breath, lets it out in one long stream. He tries to put some mustard into his words. “I want you here.”
He doesn’t think about how sometimes he wants to be useless, how he wants someone to tell him it’s okay all the same. He doesn’t think about D
Castiel walks up to the threadbare kitchen and starts rummaging through the cupboards and drawers. There’s a lot of nothing, because this is an apartment not for a human, but for him. If they could’ve gotten away with no furniture, they would’ve, but HYDRA cares deeply about appearances.
Before Dean can check his watch again, Jack hisses suddenly and drops his potato onto the table, which then bounces onto the floor. All three of his dads immediately straighten up.
in 1967,” Sam says, looking it over. Dean rubs some imaginary dust off the hood and smiles adoringly at the car, fresh from the SHIELD garages. Cas watches him from under his arm.
Sam tenses. Dean’s gotta stop asking Cas to decide non-essential things like this. Maybe they’ll talk about it later, angels and their continual lack of agency -,
“Perhaps,” Cas says. Dean watches Cas watch the club, and decides to try this whole “being brave” thing out.
“Are you hungry?” Dean asks, breaking their momentary silence. Cas looks at the table of food in front of him, which was kneaded and pressed and put onto plates by Dean just for him. Very little has been made just for Castiel in the past.
“Yeah? Well, you weren’t alive in 2004, but you still can’t stop playing with that Pad thingy,” Dean says. He makes a motion like he’s scrolling on said Pad thingy.
“You pulled me from the river, right?” Dean says in the background. Castiel nods, remembering Dean’s lax face, the wet heft of him as he dragged his limp body to shore. “Why’d you do it?”
“You probably see them from a mile away, right? Big and ugly?” Dean says, using his hands to demonstrate just how big and ugly these feelings were.
He looks in the mirror as he leaves the bathroom. He has something of a beard and his hair curls long against his neck, but it’s still him. His brother would recognize him on the street, he thinks. That provokes in him the first smile he’s had in years.
“Considering their target is me,” Castiel says, trying to stay still as the ground rumbles around him. “That’s a good strategy.”
, he says to himself, the child who used to watch bees that wandered in from the open window. That child is watching this with wide eyes.
“It always ends in a fight,” Castiel reminds him. There’s yelling outside his door. He closes his eyes, mourning this version of his life. His poor tea towel. His poor kettle.
Dean realizes. He was right to be nervous. If Dean had known, he wouldn’t have even gone. He would’ve locked himself in the dungeon and never come out.
“Wow!” Jody says, clapping her hands together. “This is... new?”
“Oh, Jack,” Cas says gently. “I’m sorry. I’m fine.”
Dean's there too, in this dream. He is sitting there, cross-legged. He lets himself think Dean's hand is firm on his thigh. He likes it there. He even wishes it was a couple inches higher.
“Cas?”
“No,” Cas concedes, holding a hot pink number before putting it back on the rack. He grabs a sparkling iridescent one, rubbing it all over with his hands and closing his eyes in thought. Like he’s finding the vibration of the ball’s frequency or whatever.
When he goes to kill Dean Winchester, the asset finds that he is crying. He wipes the tears off his cheek and looks down at his wet fingers. Malfunctioning, he thinks. He keeps moving.
"Technically, it's this German dude's cabin that I bought from him because he was in a hurry to sell and go back to Germany for his dad's funeral," Dean replies. "So, no, you're not imposing."
“Can’t say. Depends on how regularly Sam cleans his gun.”
being the stars of the show."
“Interested?” Dean asked, rolling his eyes.
"I wish they did," Cas mutters. "It's unfair that only the animal kingdom is sentient."
“Good morning, Dean,” Cas greeted. He even had that little smile playing on his lips and Dean was sure it was somehow his birthday and Christmas.
Cas nods, his Adam's apple bobbing as he swallows, releasing Dean's had to leave the kitchen in haste. Dean sighs, leaning back against the counter. Cas is quiet most of the time but when he talks he's bossy and mouthy about what he wants which is a sheer contrast from just a couple of seconds ago when Cas looked so afraid. The small card tower of hope in Dean's chest shatters when he realizes Cas would want nothing more than to get his graze back, to be that powerful cosmic being he once was. It shouldn't hurt this much, but it does anyway.
"You're inaccurate," Dean mumbles, snatching the plant from Castiel's hands and walking to the counter to pay.
“They found another body at the house. It’s the landlord,” Dean says, and it wakes Castiel up, though not as much as the coffee in Dean’s hand would. He reaches for it but Dean holds his hand away. “Nope, suit up first.”
Camael puts his hand on Dean's shoulder and he slips his eyes shut involuntarily. When he opens his eyes, he's standing in the same forest in Finland, now in broad daylight.
“I would prefer if you would talk things out instead of imbibing all this alcohol,” Cas murmurs into his hair. Dean closes his eyes, and he can almost see the disappointment in Cas’s eyes—the burden of having to deal with a colossal fuck up like him.
"I shouldn't impose, Dean. This is your home." Cas says.
It was only when he realized how they had drifted closer, close enough that Dean could feel the heat coming off Cas’s body and the silver ring around his blue eyes. He stood as still as he could, not wanting even a twitch of a muscle to startle Cas away. Cas smelled woody,
"Nothing new. I called for a favor actually," he replied. "Could you find out where Irene is right now?"
"Don't I know it," Dean chuckled. "Seriously, you pick the worst shirts to steal from my wardrobe."
"Woah, now. Angry is just coming off too strong." Dean joked, but the smile on his lips faded away quickly. He tucked his face to the crook of Castiel's neck and Castiel held him close.
She rolls her eyes, drawing a stolen angel blade out of her coat, “Just get out of my face.”
"Uh, yeah." Bobby grunts, following Sam out of the door.
He dreamt of going to school like a normal kid without a knife tucked into his backpack, he dreamt of playing soccer with his friends instead of going home early to look after Sam and he dreamt about what would’ve have happened if he had gone on a date with that guy who asked him out in sophomore year. The answer to everything was that John would have torn him a new one, but it was good to dream.
Castiel bites the inside of his cheek, trying his very best to keep his features calm and collected. It is turning out to be a very difficult task when Dean Winchester, one of the most terrifying hunters in the world, is shouting expletives at a garden hose like the piece of rubber personally wronged him. Which, it did. Cas shakes his head, walking over to Dean and reaching a hand out to help him up. Dean glares at him but takes his hand and pulls himself to his feet.
“Yeah, alright,” Dean nods, and then pauses with a frown. “I don’t know how to do that.”
"Don't need to, Sam," Irene cut him off. "You boys have a reputation of having us supernatural entities wrapped around your fingers, don't you? Case in point, your angel."
"I'm not, Cas," Dean shook his head, subdued. He felt Dean lean closer, shoulder hunching as though he was trying to make himself smaller. Something about the gesture struck a chord in Cas’s heart. When Dean spoke, his voice was soft, vulnerable even. "I would marry you– I mean, you're a h– cool guy...anyone would wanna marry you. It'd be, uh, great. Yeah."
Dean can’t help but laugh a little at that. “Damn, went right for the jugular. Huh?” He knows there is no way out of this because Benny knows exactly how much to push and when to stop pushing but that man won’t back down until he gets what he wants. “I’m not interested in the hookup and one night stand scene anymore,” he shrugs.
"Four," he says.
"Vastly," Cas replies. "There was a spider in the shower and I think I accidentally drowned it."
Dean laughed so hard, he had to lean against Baby as he wiped the tears away from his eyes, "Shit, Cas, you should try stand up comedy."
“You’re a fascinating man, Dean Winchester,” Cas smiled softly. “I’m not going to get bored or leave, as long as you don’t want me to.”
“Cas, what’s going on?”
tear up. "I know it sounds crazy but yeah, it's me."
His eyes caught something and Castiel followed Dean's line of vision in time to see Nadia surging forward to kiss Sam.
"We never found enough time for a vacation," Sam sighed. "Maybe after the apocalypse, we can go."
Castiel shook his head, "It's the middle of the night, Dean, and the weather is terrible." He said. "You don't have to worry your brother. The guest room is already made, you can stay here for the night."
He has always known glimpses of Dean’s childhood, but the weight of the responsibilities he had to carry at such a young age seems so much more antagonizing at the way Dean seems to be convinced that his upbringing was meant for nothing but looking out for his brother. Finding himself at an apparent loss of words, Cas turns to look out of the window, letting his mind fade from one thought to another like the trees that whips past them swiftly.
"Knocked it out of the park, Professor Mcgonagall," Dean grunted. "Love what you've done with the place, by the way."
"Good morning," Dean tapped the reception counter, catching the attention of the officer there. "I'm Agent Page, this is my partner Agent Bonham. We're here about the—"
"These wounds were caused by angelic weapons." Castiel says.
“I’m sorry…” Nadia scooted closer, patting his arm.
“I need those two to attend an event tomorrow."
He gets a kick out of the shock on Cas's face.
and he could get it. Maybe Cas took a part of Dean’s carefully crafted bravado along with the grace he gave up for Dean. He was exhilarated and terrified.
Castiel regains some clarity at the desperation in Dean's voice. He sighs, "Alright. I will stay."
Dean pulled away with a gasp, staring back at Cas’s wide eyes and pink lips, forgetting all of his primary education at once.
Using the momentary distraction, Castiel swung as hard as he could, the sharp slice of the metal through the air followed by the sound of a clean cut being made. The splatter of blood on his neck was followed by that of two bodies hitting the ground. Cas pried his eyes open against his own will, panting as he took in the sight of
"Yes." Castiel stares at him like it's a blinking contest, "You were in distress and I had to help."
“If that’s what it takes, then I’m ready to take one for the team,” Sam replied. Bastard. “Dean, do you really think there’s nothing there?”
"I'm an angel, Dean."
Cas’ eyes widen, the silver of blue barely visible, “Dean, we need to-” His words die out as the ground rumbles violently, before the tent comes crashing down on them.
Cas climbed into the car even though he looked hesitant, and Dean could live with that for now.
The living room is a mess and Cindy is curled up on the floor, a flickering figure standing over her.
“I thought I was gonna lose you, Cas.” Dean murmured against his skin. “You said it was just out of impulse and…”
Dean presses the heel of his hand against his hand against his eyes, sharp pressure building against his temples. An arm slides around his shoulder and Dean jumps, only remembering now that Cas has been in the room this whole time.
"Got both my eyes?" Dean grinned wide, fingers fiddling with the button on Castiel's coat.
"Lilith has fetched three girls so far." She says, "She's supposed to be hunting for her next three any time now. But before I tell you anything else, let's talk terms."
“Agent Moscone, FBI,” he flips the badge closed. “I’m looking into the-”
Castiel's heart began fluttering hard in his chest, his throat suddenly feeling too dry. He opened his mouth hoping some reply would make it past his lips, but Dean continued talking.
“What?” Dean says. He drops the smile and buries his face in the fridge, looking for the nice farmer’s market heirloom tomatoes he had Cas buy. The ones at the store are too mushy.
“No, well, she
“It’s okay, Jack,” Cas says, rubbing his eyes. “It's our fault for staying out so late.”
“I apologize for dying in front of you,” Cas says finally. A mittened hand goes up Dean’s neck and back down. “I never thought I’d be able to say it otherwise.”
“Stephen King,” Cas says, showing him the cover while keeping his finger on his page. It’s The Shining.
“Dean?” Cas says.
“Cool,” Claire says. She smirks at Cas.
“When you say love,” Cas croaks out. He has a hand balanced on the cart and one on the bagel display.
“We’re in a gazebo, dude. The only thing that could really kill us here are rabid Pinterest moms,” Dean says. Cas relaxes incrementally next to him, kneading his hands like he’s working the blood back into them. “You’re good.”
The screen above them outlined with a scoreboard saying “DEAN” AND “CAS” on it flashes an 8. Cas tries two more times to hit the outermost pins, just glancing one on his last try. He receives his 9 gracefully. He sits down next to Dean, looking smug, and gestures Dean forward.
The music starts up again as they tear down the highway towards Lebanon. The warbling first notes of "Somebody to Love" come cheerily out of the speakers, which is sort of disjointed with the current mood. This one brings back memories of him and Lee doing karaoke as kids; the bright lights of the stage, Lee’s hand on his shoulder next to him, the warbling of his own voice. On top of the world.
Dean realizes. He stares at the hard set of Cas’ jaw and thinks,
“It’s
Dean prays.
“Sure,” Cas says.
“Cas,” Dean says. Fuck, he really is crying. “Cas.”
It is set in stone now. Nothing you can do will change it. So you wait.
“Like what?” Cas says. His eyes are narrowed.
Dean considers the shifting lake, the sky, the wide and pale moon. He considers the warm breeze, the smell of smoke from someone’s campfire as they barbecue dinner, a radio left on blaring a shitty pop song. Humanity at its core — a man-made lake, a campfire in the distance, someone humming quietly beside you.
“You are so strong, please stir this,” Dean whispers.
The man looks around at the empty airplane hanger and, finding it satisfactory, comes closer to the cube, hands in the pockets of his long, black coat. Cas watches him move carefully. His hair keeps getting in his eyes, but he doesn’t move to fix it.
“It’s not you, Sam,” Cas tries.
They fall into an easy silence. There’s a buzzing that Dean can barely hear, moths and mosquitos bumping up against the lights above him. He’s surprised he hasn’t been bit yet, even with all his layers on. Maybe Cas is a living mosquito repellant, just a little too inhuman to get blood from. Maybe the mosquitos would be baptized after. Maybe they’d go to bug heaven.
“Huh?” Dean says. He’s paused on top of the stairs, waiting for Castiel to cross the threshold.
Cas doesn’t know how many ways or languages he could say this, only that Dean would not believe him in any of them. So he makes it obvious he will stay. He puts his boots in Dean’s room, tucked up against the wall. He calls it “our home” to the librarians in the library, knowing Dean will hear it from a few shelves away. Sometimes he thinks if he were blindfolded and put in another state, he could find his way home from the sounds alone. He could hear the heartbeat of this place thrumming through his feet.
Any moment now. Any moment now.
,” Crowley says in terrible Russian. It’s apparently effective enough as Castiel can feel his body stiffen at the words, can feel his mind start to cloud over. He hasn’t felt like this in years, like he’s watching his body move on its own. He yells for it to stop, any of it.
The final time, after thousands of imitators in identical patriotic suits were killed and the asset had gotten every inch of his suit coated in blood, they asked him to kill Captain America and he complied without hesitating. When he was done ripping the proxy’s head off his shoulders, he dropped it, stood up, and waited for further instruction. He was perfect, as malleable as clay and stronger than any other man before him.
“Classic,” Dean says. Cas nods in assent. “You enjoyin’ it?”
“This is just another Friday night, Cas,” Dean says with the bravado of a man who isn’t 100% sure of what he’s saying. “It’s just dinner.”
“Too bad,” Dean says quietly, and ignores the way Cas’ eyes burn holes in his jaw, the air around them suddenly thick. Dean presses the gas pedal, and Doll’s Saloon finally sinks out of sight.
Sam clears his throat after a second. “Do we need a salad or, uh, any sort of side dish tonight, Cas?”
“Is there a problem?” Cas says, resting his book on the table. He looks at everyone, one by one, and Jack looks back at him, panicked.
Claire catches Jack in the hallway before they leave, and they talk for a long time. It ends with Claire briefly clapping Jack on the shoulder and Jack letting it happen, and they both have smiles when they step away from each other. For two people with very different parents, they have the same way of looking up and smiling, the same way of nodding solemnly, the same blue eyes.
“I am several millennia old. I am sure I’m sharpening your knife correctly.”
“Alright,” Dean says. “I warned you.”
“What? No,” Cas says. “Why, do you?”
Cas hums along to Zeppelin, oblivious. The scenery passes in bursts, lit up by the occasion billboard or the glowing McDonald’s arches.
The Shepherd’s pie is delicious.
“It depends on what your definition of the word is,” Cas says quietly, which doesn’t make any damn sense at all. Dean turns the car on without another word and peels out of the driving lot of Three Graves Lanes, kicking up gravel and dust behind them. Conversation over. Dean works his hands out of the death grip they have on the wheel.
Said leviathan’s eyes crinkle at the corners when he sees him. “Hello, Dean.”
They get the bell peppers, the cinnamon rolls, and some romaine lettuce. Cas’ hand is warm on Dean’s waist the entire time.
“Do you know where I used to go when I left you before?” Cas says. He is staring up at the ceiling of their room, eyes wide open. It’s not really a question.
“She keeps talking about just
“I want—,” Dean chokes on the word, but valiantly keeps going. “I want you with us. In the bunker.”
Dean triumphantly announces, “Guess who’s coming to dinner!” He slaps Castiel on the back and leaves his hand on his shoulder, his thumb absentmindedly skimming the top of Castiel’s shoulder bone over and over again. It’s almost overwhelming. Castiel has been keeping himself at a physical distance since the deal, and this 一
Cas feels happy for a bright, brilliant second. It’s as foreign as anything else is these days, but he carefully smiles back at Dean, using all the muscles a human would use. Dean looks pleased, pursing his lips in a smile and looking down at his lap.
“Hey, on that note,” Dean says, wiping his hands on a paper napkin and setting his elbows on the table, disrupting Cas’ train of thought. He looks at Cas, and Cas squints his eyes in confusion. “Cas and I have a little something we want to share with you guys.”
He even thinks he’s hungry. How odd. Castiel dwells on the gnawing pit inside his stomach and vows to think about it later.
“Sure,” Castiel says. He doesn’t get the reference, but he’s sure Dean said it with the intent to explain it to him later. “I was just spending time with God’s creatures.”
“I’m gonna head back to sleep,” Dean says. He presses his lips together, nods, and turns to go out the door, but Castiel holds out a hand to stop him.
It’s strange how songs can bring you back to a moment in time like it just happened. Dean can feel his dad’s heavy leather jacket on his shoulders like armor, can feel the sweat gathering on his chin and under his eyes during their marathon drives in the summer. He remembers being so lonely it felt like the only thing that kept him alive was the fact that he was moving, like a shark. Same dead eyes too. Same pretty grin.
It‘s not unwanted, his advances toward Dean. He must hold onto that as his central truth because anything less than that and his tenuous grasp on this situation completely fails. He wants Dean to touch him, but he respects if Dean doesn’t want to. Cas can abstain the rest of his life without sexual conduct, he thinks. But he didn’t think Dean would feel the same.
“Well, you can’t go wrong with barbecue, I guess,” Dean says, clearly seeing the problem. Cas relaxes minutely as Dean fixes him a paper plate filled to the brim with beef brisket, pulled pork, and slabs of cornbread and hands it to him, dripping sauce onto the table. Sam grimaces.
“Give me names of her previous three victims.” Sam tells Ruby.
Everything else can wait.
Night. “I still have some inventory left to take, I could do that and maybe translate a few books by the time you’re done.
"Shit, I'm so close, sweetheart." Dean groaned, his thrusts falling out of rhythm.  He looked gorgeous like this, lips parted and eyes hooded. Castiel kissed him, swallowing every moan spilling out of Dean's lips.
"Awh, don't be like that," Dean grins, jostling the pan to spread the grease around. "I've developed tolerance and you're due for a lifetime of bacon. We'll be fine."
"There was a time when I was deeply injured during the war and had to be sent off to rest. I had nothing to do except watch over humanity," Cas says.
He rubs his eyes tiredly looking down the long hallway, to see the end of a pearly white wing disappear round the corner. It's been a long day, so he simply chalks it up to his exhaustion.
“I have got this,” Cas stopped him with a hand on his arm right where Mark used to be. “Go wash your hands.”
Cas' hands still and Dean feels soft kisses being pressed to his shoulder. "That doesn't mean you don't deserve to be taken care of."
family have made yours and Sam's life a living hell. I am a part of-"
“No, Cas. Shit, it’s never yours or anyone’s fault,” he pulled away with the intent of wiping away the guilt in Cas’s eyes that he knew was there. “I was just tired, Cas. So goddamn tired of burning the candle on both ends.”
Dean can't help but let the accusatory tone seep into his words. He always wondered why people had to suffer when there was this whole bunch of people with all kinds of mojo living in the clouds. It was unfair...
(See the end of the chapter for
“Holy shit. I was just throwing a bone out there.” Sam gasped. “You love him.”
“Oh shut it, you two.” Mary walked up to them, pulling both of them into a hug.
Dean picked up his phone and shot Cas a text, just in case.
says the article as the address of the crime scene. After a five minute long struggle with his GPS, Castiel begins driving, something about being in motion and the lift and fall of the tires on gravel somewhat comforting. He turns up the volume of the stereo, the first few chords of
"Give your brother some credit, Sammy, I can handle a pack of wolves," Dean says, grinning even if Sam can't see him. "Eileen doing okay?"
Anyways, hope you enjoyed the chapter. See you next week.
“He is right.” Castiel seconds.
"Cas," Dean swallows with a click, his brain to mouth filter momentarily on the fritz.
"Nobody's asking you, Dean," Irene trailed her gaze away from Castiel, and on to Sam. "You. Remember your sweet little girlfriend Jessica?"
"Yeah, well," Nadia shrugged. "I was the second person on the scene, after Jason's wife Emily...she hasn't uttered a word since then."
And now Dean feels like an asshole. This whole thing is turning into a routine—Dean being a dick and Cas still putting up with his nonsense long enough for Dean to feel like shit over unloading his pathetic self on Cas—like clockwork. Neither of them learn their lesson.
"Good, you're alright," Dean said, simple, easy. Out of the corner of his vision he saw Sam roll his eyes and Dean knew better than to open that can of worms now. Or ever.
"It feels like yesterday when Sammy was just joining school." Dean said, without taking his eyes off his brother and his wife.
“You’re wearing overalls, Jaime,” Ivan makes a face. “Get changed and we can get this party started.”
Cas glares at her, “This is not a conversation I wish to have with you.”
“Dean... please…” Castiel ushered, hoping Dean would know what he wanted.
Dean sucked in a sharp breath, feeling his heart beat a little faster.
Miracle nudges his knee, ever the knowing one, and Dean scratches under his ear.
"I do." Castiel handed him the clothes, walking out of the door. "Take your time."
"Thank you," Cas said, placing his hand on top of Dean's where it was holding his. Dean absently noticed how close they were standing, close enough to feel the rhythm of Cas's breathing and see the soft shade of pink on his cheeks.
Eileen signs, brows raised as she leans back against her chair,
“Ruby…”
Barely five minutes of reckless driving later, they are bursting in through Cindy's front door, guns in hand. A plate misses Dean's face by nearly inches and clatters against the wall.
“Well, you boys are nicer about it than the officer working the case,” Homer shrugged. “That lady cursed up a storm.”
"Hey, get offa her!" he barked, bracing for a fight, but the man stepped back easily, wide eyed. Dean will have to find something else to punch.
"You're not God, Dean. Even he couldn't keep everyone safe," Castiel replied, rubbing his hand up and down his back. "You can't save everyone, my friend."
“It’s okay, I’m more of a licorice guy.”
"I'm fine."
the mother hen."
The residents of the neighborhood were all gathered around in the party hall, a situation appropriate grimness on their faces even while they chit-chatted and drank gathered around in small groups. Dean rolled his eyes and scoffed because two guys were dead and “cheering up” was the last thing anyone should be doing.
"Or," Ruby holds up a finger, "I give you intel,” She glances at Sam, "You give me my knife back, right now."
Eileen signs.
"Dean!"
it ain’t new to Dean. It’s always been easy for him. Hell, he’s been easy. Dean likes curves he can trail his hands over and strong arms that can throw him around a bit, just because he
“Shut it, will you?” Dean scowled at her, putting the ring back in his pocket. “Only Sam, Jess and Charlie know. Now you too.”
Dean wakes up to an empty bed and a mind full of worry. He remembers the solid warmth of Cas against his chest and the scratch of his stubble, still ghosting against Dean’s jaw. He rubs the sleep out of his eyes and pads out to the living room, following the scent of coffee.
“Home?” Dean says finally. Cas is a couple of inches closer to him than normal. His breath smells like the candy they got from the vending machine right before they left, right next to the giggling moms. There was a blonde one wearing a hockey jersey that looked at Cas with barely disguised interest, and Dean scowled right back at her as Cas punched in the number for Sour Patch Kids into the machine, oblivious.
Steinbeck. It is weirdly familiar in some aspects. He doesn’t think about it too hard.
There’s silence in the kitchen as everyone digests that. Cas holds his arms at his sides stiffly, like he wasn’t sure how to stand with all this awkwardness and himself in one room.
, Cas thinks to slow his own heartbeat down. He’s like a dog when its owner comes home, enthusiastic and severely misjudging their permanence.
Dean flicks on the lights. Castiel has been doing this memorizing in the dark, where he can see perfectly fine, but he realizes it might be disconcerting. He performatively squints his eyes against the sudden light and the confusion on Dean’S face.
The water that is gathering around him is cloudy with dirt and blood. The other chip starts to emerge from the other parts of his shoulder as he peels back circuitry and caked-on dirt. Castiel is much more careful about this one. As soon as it’s offline, they will divert all HYDRA personnel to look for him. He can’t run very fast like this, and there’s nowhere he can go.
There are footsteps on the roof above him. Ten to twelve SWAT agents it sounds like. He eyes Dean, wondering if he sent them.
“Bright side,” Dean says, slapping both of his hands together. His smile is watery when he aims it at Cas, but it is a smile nonetheless. “Might get some heavy duty painkillers for this. Could sell ‘em if you wanted to. Build a nest egg.”
“I thought she was visiting Jody,” Dean says, breathing deeply to hide that he got winded stirring cream cheese.
“I’ll show you sweet,” Dean mutters as he turns and cuts a thick slice of the fluffy beer bread. He takes a second to marvel that
“Oh.” Dean feels drunk, although he hasn’t had anything to drink since they left the house. He keeps his hands on Cas’ shoulders. He keeps his hands on Cas’ shoulders. He
“I need you,” Dean Winchester had said on the aircraft carrier, one eye swollen shut and a tooth regrowing in his top gums. “I need you, Cas.”
“Just nice?” Dean teases. He puts a hand on the top of the car and leans in, like he’s flirting with a chorus girl at a dance hall. Cas feels… okay being the chorus girl. Just this once.
Cas makes no effort to sneak around Jack’s sleeping form. He flicks on the kitchen light as soon as he gets near it, which makes Jack startle. He tips the chair in surprise, just catching his balance by grabbing the edge of the table.
Dean tries to wrestle the thought down but it comes out regardless. Shucking corn next to him and wearing overalls, petting the barn cat and sitting with his face in the sun.
He doesn’t think about it, is what he means.
“Cas,” Dean whispers as they break apart, and one of Dean’s hands goes into his hair, and his weight settles on Cas’ thighs. Cas groans in relief.
“Thank you, Ellie,” Cas says, and takes the short-ribs. “I’ll see you soon.”
“Is that standard, Lebowski?” Dean says to the maybe-Cas imposter because he can’t help himself and he’s a smartass. He crosses his arms across his shirts, resting his arm on the knife he has up his sleeve.
“I think they turned out okay,” Kaia says, putting the bowl on the counter next to the donuts. She unwraps the tin foil, and there are indeed a couple of heads of cauliflower in there, covered in batter and what appears to be Frank’s Red Hot. “We’ll need to put them in the oven to warm up again.”
“You’re eating the chicken wings now too? Jesus, aren’t you, like, a vegetarian or something?” Dean says, shaking the box of mozzarella sticks onto a sheet pan and shoving them in the oven.
Castiel isn’t quite sure how he managed to start this conversation without saying a single word, but he’s glad it happened. He’s also glad this is happening, Dean’s hands warm on the swell of his lower back and Cas’ hands on those broad shoulders. Cas imagines himself ten years ago, watching this man from the corner of his eye, hoping he wouldn’t turn away if he looked too long. He thinks about that Castiel, a Castiel with a pillar of salt as a spine. One look back and it all collapsed.
“We will talk later,” he promises warmly. He lets them pass into the foyer, and they all move toward the table, which has been set rather nicely by Jack. “Here, I will take your—,”
“I see,” Cas hums. “I’m sure the reality is a little different.” He does a Dean-smile, the one he does only at him. Amused, kinda. Happy. Dean has this exact smile imprinted in a space in his chest, where he opens it and stares at it, and puts it away.
“Yes,” Jack says in a way that means
“Absolutely,” Cas says.
He brings up that rabbit again in his mind’s eye, the only place in this realm that isn’t dark. The bunny has very soft fur and dark eyes and it comes forward to sniff his hand. The bunny doesn’t run away when he sits down next to it. He thinks he can hear birds chirping too if he focuses, and he can hear the dark buzz of insects come near his ears.
“Anybody ever tell you that you smell really good?” Dean says.
Dean sniffles, pinches the bridge of his nose, and nods once. He looks at him with red-rimmed eyes, running them over Cas’ white hotel gown, his metal arm flayed open to its gristly components, his hair tied back in a neat bun. “Yeah. I know, Cas. But that damn doctor is crying over what they did to you, man. How-,”
They don't talk about the confession.
“Can we fit the car in there?” Cas says, looking past Dean to the spot. Dean scoffs.
“A chicken with ten thighs would be humorous. But Dean,” Cas says, “I think I need to talk to you about something.”
“Dean,” Cas says, squinting. “This is your first gay relationship?”
“Cas?”
“Yeah, well. We could maybe go there one day. It would be fun. They gotta have some Dolly, right? 9-5?”
Dean wipes a tear from under Cas’ eye. Cas leans into his hand as he does it. “We’ll talk about it more when we get home, okay? We have to get Sam’s bell peppers, and we can get your terrible cinnamon buns, and then we can watch a movie and figure this out.”
The energy is not unlike the first day a new chef cooks for the president of a small country, but Cas is a smart man and doesn’t comment. Sam, another smart man, does, and even as quickly as Dean orders Sam out of the kitchen for “insubordination,” Dean needs it as much as he needs silence from Cas and Jack. He needs all of their energy to calm him down. Pressed, Dean wouldn’t be able to name what he’s feeling, but Cas, a proverbial scholar in Dean studies, could name it in the dark: a fear of rejection. He’s seen it too many times to not know it as it shows.
“There’s one called Three Grave Lanes near Lincoln,” Cas says.
“Dean,” Cas says. “Dean.”
“Awesome,” Dean says.
Cas. You’re the one person I couldn’t shake off. Even with all of my petty, childish bullcrap. I know I get angry sometimes, and I know I pick fights, and hell, I know you pick ‘em too, you bastard. But I don’t want to lose this.” Dean’s eyes were wide, and pleading, and very, very green. “I think I want to spend my life with you, so what if the sex isn’t good, huh? You’re left with a limp-dicked piece of crap.”
“Maybe you feel like if you start talking about it, you won’t stop, right? Especially to a random bloke like myself or SHIELD. Well, don’t worry your pretty head about it,” Crowley says, tapping something briefly onto the tablet in front of him and then looking up. “I’m only here to trouble you briefly.”
“Do you know what precipitated this?” Cas asks finally, like he’s been asking himself since he walked in the kitchen that morning. Sam shrugs, reaching over to the plate of fries and grabbing a handful, placing them on top of each other before knocking them all back at once.
“No! No. I just thought since you came in here,” Dean says.. “Just thought it would be about something... else.”
“Well, she’s still kicking. She’s in the Alzheimer’s ward at Howard. After I disappeared, she got married and had a few kids,” Dean says. His tone is nonchalant, but Cas knows that it hurts to say. Dean keeps his eyes on the window as he talks, folding his hands into his chest gently.
Strike.
“Jody,” Cas says, keeping his eyes resolutely outside the car.
“Come on, man. Thirteen years in my car, you have no idea what bands you like?” Dean says, cutting a look over to him. Cas has a particularly guilty expression, just visible in the orange glow of the streetlamps. “I see that look. Pick whatever. I won’t get bitchy about it.”
He fist pumps and looks at Cas, who is smiling back at him. A group three lanes down erupts in cheering. Someone must’ve won large. Dean knows the feeling.
“Jeez, Cas,” Dean says, crossing his arms and leaning against the doorway “Way to scare the kid.”
“Hello, Dean,” Castiel tries. He is aiming for casual but he isn’t sure he really gets there.
“That’s new for you guys,” Ellie says, moving down the case. Her hands move methodically through the display, stopping in front of the mass of bone and meat that constitute the short-rib. “Special occasion?”
“It’s nothing, Cas. Bobby used to make it,” Sam says, rubbing at his forehead and looking at the ground. “He’d make it on some nights when Dad didn’t come back for whatever reason.”
“Well. Good,” Dean says. “You don’t have to sharpen it if you don’t want to. Just saying.”
“Gross,” Sam said, snapping back into his little brother mode so seamlessly it was like the other conversation never existed. Cas always marveled at the intricacies of human communication, but this felt troubling. Dean came over to him a second later to put a light hand on his shoulder and turn him toward the theatre entrance, and Cas saw Sam hunch over again as he turned, his eyes on the exits.
“I—,” Cas starts and stops. “There are a couple of other places I’ve always been curious about.” His long fingers drum on the leather seats,
“Of course,” Cas says softly. He did like her, despite his childish jealousy. She was in the unenviable position of being Black, a woman, and a high-ranking official in a country that didn’t want her to be any of those things, and she was great at what she did. Castiel would’ve attended their wedding dressed to the nines with a smile on his face.
Not that he wasn’t tired but going to sleep meant nightmares and he was in a really good mood to let the classic fuck ups of his life hinder. It wasn’t always hell or purgatory, sometimes it was just his dad’s voice and other times baby Sam’s cries. Ignoring the majorly fucked up thought of his dad haunting him in his nightmares, Dean still hated the guy sometimes. Sure, he’d have given his life to protect Sam no matter what, but the part of himself that he lost along the way was never gonna come back. It was useless dwelling over it, he knew, but if he could get a do over, there were things he wanted to do differently.
Castiel smoothed his hand down Dean's shoulder in reassurance before catching Sam's gaze in the rearview mirror, "He could be seriously injured."
so—and he rarely lets himself dwell on what he had left behind. He doesn’t know if the people he knew back then are still the same; if they even remember him, but he’s not upset over it. He isn’t expecting them to wait when they hadn’t asked him to stay.
The words land heavy on his chest. He does not expect anything from the Winchesters, that does not mean he won’t do what is right.
"I'm alright, Dean." Castiel leans forward, capturing his lips in a gentle kiss. Dean all but melts, hands coming around to rest on his waist. They kiss for a while until Dean seems substantially relaxed.
“I always felt like my purpose was centered around you. I wanted to be close to you, feel your soul respond to my grace in a way no being has ever done. I reveled in those feelings without realizing what it meant,” Cas smiled softly. "When I think about the time I had to leave you in purgatory I convince myself it was then, but I start recalling a time before that, and then another and it keeps going backwards."
"Is there something you wanna share with the class?" Nadia raised a brow. "I just watched someone get shot and run away like it was nothing."
“We used to have two boys of your kind living two houses down the road from here, but they moved a while ago.” Linda notes.
“Perfect.” Dean says, his shoulders relaxing. “Now let's go gank Lottie and Kit.”
“Wow.” Charlie clutched her hand to her heart. “And I thought we were having something here.”
Castiel pulled Dean back by the elbow, keeping him grounded. He sees Ruby disappear through his peripheral vision and he turns to Ambriel,
"It's alright," Sam assured her. "Anything we can get would be helpful right now."
“Agent Gibbs and this is my partner Agent Winston.” The flashing of badges are no more than muscle memory at this point. “We would like to ask a few questions regarding your ex-husband’s death.”
They did have a lot to hold against each other in terms of betrayals and let downs; Castiel more so to blame than Dean. It makes him wonder if Dean truly forgives him for working with Crowley or the Leviathans, or the angels falling. He doesn’t expect Dean to forgive him, but the idea of their friendship being something that is balanced on a heap of half-hearted forgiveness and repressed hurt is unsettling. He knows there will come a day when Dean finally realizes that Cas is not worth forgiving and forgetting everything that transpired between them
"I can assure you that all your two hundred and six bones are intact," Cas says, matter-of-factly, though Dean doesn't miss the amused smile in his voice.
"Double bluffing. It's a term from-" Castiel stops himself at the confused look on his brother's face. "My point is, they would be expecting us to think they are hiding him in some high security surrounding. Our plan here is that we make no assumptions. Search anywhere and everywhere that deems suspicion."
"You said we could do more." Castiel reminds him, trailing his fingers over Dean's clothed chest.
"Exactly what it sounds like," Sam replied absently. "or do you want me to call the chef?"
Sam couldn't help but laugh, "Honestly, I don't know. I'm just waiting for them to figure it out."
He was halfway through clearing the plates when Dean called out to him, “What’s in here, Cas?”
Castiel scoots down next to her, catching his own breath, “Do you think it will work?”
Castiel blinks at Dean’s silhouette in the dimly lit room, “If you are referring to a relationship, no.”
"Don't get used to this, Cas." Dean ran his hands up and down Cas' back, "You don't got me once we're back home."
“Alright.” Dean sighed, “You gonna be okay here for a minute?”
"Who the hell is there?" Still nothing. "Come on buddy, I don't got a magic lamp to rub."
“I’m happy for you then,” Cas says, and he’s so goddamn calm about all this, it pisses Dean off. Well, Cas might be done with this, but Dean is not.
"Oh…" Dean replies eloquently.
“Three bodies in the past week,” Dean says, “All of them, throats ripped out. We gotta check this out."
"Your mom," Jo kicks him in the shin.
"All right," Dean sighs. "I'll be there in an hour tops."
Sam’s argument seems valid. Stopping Lilith is the most efficient way of stopping the apocalypse, considering how any seal could be broken any moment.
“Thanks, man,” Dean slaps him on the back. “See you at work,” he gives Benny one last nod and walks out of the bar.
"I don't know about that but Dean is an amazing person. " Cas said. "He doesn't give himself enough credit."
"You fucking asshole." Someone above him says. His jaw throbs a little. Scratch that. It throbs a lot.
"More, Cas…please." Dean begs, his dignity lying scattered on the floor along with his haphazardly strewn clothes. Cas doesn't hesitate before pushing in another finger, the pace quicker than before. Dean moans, shame curling in his chest as he thrusts back for more and more, all air in the room suddenly not enough.
Cas was silent for a moment, fingers tracing nonsense on Dean's skin.
"Do we have anywhere to be?" Cas asked, muffled by the pillow.
“Dean, are you listening?” Cas’s voice snapped him out of his thoughts back into the present as a wave of blush climbed up his neck.
"Dean," he called softly, pressing a hand to the hunter's chest, a sigh of relief pushing past his lips as he felt Dean's heart beating under his hand. "Dean, can you hear me?"
“Give me your hand,” Cas says, and Dean holds his palm out without question, because if Cas wants to hold his hand, then who’s he to say no. Instead, Cas picks up a pen from the table and draws a small line across his palm. Dean watches as Cas sweeps a thumb over the blue ink, making the line vanish.
Sam grabbed his laptop, pulling it open because he felt like he was intruding on something he was not meant to witness. Maybe a solo hunt would be a good idea right then, that would give Dean and Cas the time to sort themselves out. Then again, the last time his attention was elsewhere, for all his insecurities about Cas leaving, Dean had somehow ended up kicking Cas out of the bunker and Sam was not willing to have a repeat of that. He had watched Dean mop around like a war widow way too many times by now.
“You two are adorable,” Linda chuckles, and as much as Cas wants to see Dean’s reaction, it isn’t worth betraying the color creeping up his own cheeks. “And, don’t you boys worry about all that. You’re going to be okay here."
“Is he though?” Dean asks, “We can’t babysit him in heaven, Bobby. He’s gonna end up...” The rest of the sentence refuses to make its way out of Dean’s mouth.
Cas needed him to breathe. Dean could do that. He would do anything Cas wanted because the man—
Injuries were not new to him. Not on himself, not on Dean. After all, he was the one who rebuilt Dean's body and stitched it to his soul from the very first atom. He knew where each scar on Dean's skin remained etched to, and he knew the story behind each one of those. He could write tales worth the span of the universe regarding every single speck that made up Dean Winchester.
"Commander?" Dean mouths and Cas shoots him a helpless shrug.
“Ground control to Major Tom,” Dean mumbles softly, a little bit scared that if he breaks the silence, Cas might strangle him to death. “Say something, dude.”
“By all means, be my guest.”
