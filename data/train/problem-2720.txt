The next day, the detective acquired a small wardrobe for his lover, ignoring Danny’s protests. After all, a handful of jeans and some popular culture tee-shirts didn’t even cost as much altogether as a single pair of Sherlock’s bespoke shoes. Danny couldn’t wear his worn-out clothes every single day, though he seemed content to dress mainly in Sherlock’s spare pyjamas. Sherlock found a great deal of satisfaction in tending to Danny’s needs and began to perceive John’s views on the matter, after all, the doctor had patched Sherlock up for years, fed him meals even when Sherlock said no, and generally looked after him. Sherlock even brought Danny to meet Molly.
Sherlock flushed a brilliant pink and seemed to be unable to look up from his steaming mug. Taking a sip and clearing his throat once again, an obviously nervous Sherlock Holmes sat straighter on the kitchen chair he was currently occupying, and visibly steeled himself, clearing his throat unnecessarily, “Dr Watson, would you be interested in joining me for dinner?” John blinked.
“Oh, I would have found a way to
When John became aware next, he had to check his nearly dead mobile for the date. The better part of a week had passed during their heat, and he was tired still. He didn’t recall eating or drinking clearly but they must have done since he wasn’t dehydrated. He felt exceedingly tired but his mind was clear, his thoughts moving easily instead of spinning themselves into a muddle. Looking around, he wrinkled his nose at the disgusting mess. There was dried come, slick, and mess everywhere. Their bedding was ruined, even their pillows stained and crusty. Sherlock was snoring face down, his long legs still spread, his thighs as crusty as the bed, his hole reddened and raw looking. Spunk was still leaking out of it and John’s sore cock gave a hopeful twitch before giving up out of sheer exhaustion.
John looked up, “No. You
“Daddy,” Sherlock couldn’t help himself, calling out for what he most desperately wanted, “Take me, daddy, I need it.” That big fat head was popping in and out of his hole in the filthiest of ways, making him stretch and burn more than ever. The soldier was toying with him, extending the burn, and Sherlock felt his mind slipping away faster than normal as his senses were aroused by the mix of pleasure and pain.
“Oh, John, you’re finally coherent!” Sherlock stepped close and wrapped his arms around John in a relieved hug, “You are so sick right now, John. We’re in here to get your fever down.”
John then worked out a deal with the doctors and Mycroft, arranging special deliveries so that the soft meals that Sherlock was required to consume were made up of foods that Sherlock didn’t mind. No energy was lost in fighting to get dinner in, or flat-out refusal to eat. The first time it had happened, Sherlock had looked hard at John, wondering what he was about. “I know you who are,” said John, carefully feeding Sherlock one soft spoonful at a time until he was done. After the meal had been cleaned away, Sherlock stretched his neck a bit and turned his face in what he hoped was an appropriately demanding gesture. John smiled before he leaned over and carefully helped Sherlock lift and turn his head just enough to kiss his lips, “You’re the person I care for the most.” Sherlock smiled, having gotten what he’d wanted, definite romantic physical contact.
The next morning, John got up. Rosie was energetic and hungry, so he hauled her down to the kitchen the moment they were dressed and made her breakfast. He noticed that the sandwiches were gone and that some of the fresh fruit had been eaten, and that tea had been made and consumed since there were now dirty cups in the sink, but Danny and Sherlock were nowhere to be found. John even tapped on Sherlock’s bedroom door but heard nothing.
Danny was very nearly as motivated as Sherlock was, and at first, Sherlock thought it odd. An entire week went by before Danny explained his fervour, “If only people had been this serious about finding Alex, we might have gotten to him in time. If I’d had the right connections, maybe he wouldn’t have died. If I’d known the right things the right way, maybe I could have done something to keep them from wanting to have him killed. My Alex is gone but your John is not. I’m making a pot of soup, and we’re going to have those rolls that Mrs Hudson made for us. I don’t want us to run out of energy because we’ve got another long night in front of us.”
Sherlock lay on his hospital bed and assessed himself. Gingerly, he tested each limb carefully and tried to sit up. The strain was universally intense and, at the moment, not possible, so Sherlock deduced that he’d be struck hard enough to render him unconscious and to over-strain his musculature in various locations, but that apart from bruising and swelling, he was essentially undamaged. He heaved a sigh of relief. He could probably get out of here after a single night of being carefully monitored. He lay there, miserable and alone for almost an hour before Mycroft rushed in looking harried, anxious, and worried, “Brother! What happened? You ran off and no one could reach you. I found the remains of your mobile on the street.”
The classic British invisibility field sprung up around the pair of them as Londoners avoided looking at them or in any way noticing that a smaller man was being dragged away by a bigger and taller man. John’s arms were limp and useless, and he could barely get his legs to work. His eyes had become bleary and impossible to focus, and he couldn’t get his mouth to work correctly. Before they reached the exit, a second man appeared, taking John’s other arm over his shoulders, allowing the two of them to carry John easily away. Before he could overcome any of these problems, they were out on the street for half a block before John was pushed into the back seat of a car. John hoped against hope that Mycroft was watching via CCTV and would be tracking him, or that the security detail that had been tailing him since the move would miraculously drive by and execute a timely rescue. He thought about pushing through to the other side of the car and attempting to get away, but his body just didn’t want to respond.
John felt an earnest grin spread across his face, “The only one in the world.”
Mycroft rolled his eyes, and huffed out an impatient breath, “That’s right, Sherlock, let’s make it all about you,
John followed instruction and found that the acidic drink did indeed enhance the rich flavour of the slow-cooked stew. It was so thick that he could nearly eat the entire dish with a fork, and he chased the last crumb and drop with his spoon, ending his meal with the last swallow of his mulled wine. “Delicious, Sherlock, just incredible.” John was so happy. He was tired from his long day of work, the icy walk home, but now he felt both relaxed and refreshed, filled with good warm food, and enjoying the pleased expression on Sherlock’s face, “This was the nicest meal ever.”
John nodded. After he retrieved the presents from where he had them hidden, John was going to secretly trade out her old microwave for a brand new one that he’d gotten for her. “New appliance. You know that old microwave of hers hasn’t been working properly.”
Sherlock’s brain stopped producing words and went right into action-only mode. He watched himself hold his erection straight, pressing the head of his painfully hard shaft against the slick wet tightness of John’s hole. Both men groaned softly as Sherlock’s glans pushed John’s hole open wide. Sherlock nearly growled with pleasure as the tight wet ring of flesh began to swallow him, the wrinkled edges of John’s anus stretching into a gorgeous pink ring around his cock. “John,” he sighed, “Yes.”
“Do you promise, Sherlock?” John’s eyes were intense, “You get bored easily. Will you be bored of this too?”
“Yes, John, it’s very sensitive.”
Deeply heartened, John knew he couldn’t waste this opportunity, so boldly he added,
“Ugh,” Sherlock’s arm had stuck to John’s ribcage and both men winced as he peeled it off, “As enjoyable as that was, I’m going to agree. Come along, John, let’s clean up.”
lying.
“Yeah,” John proved his point by drinking more water, successfully swallowing without making a fool of himself, “Let’s go.”
Danny tilted his head back to kiss Sherlock firmly on the lips, “Goodnight, Sherlock.” It was so easy to fall asleep together, their hearts and bodies sapped from emotional turmoil. Sherlock slept hard for the first time in months, and when he woke, the day was already well begun, and Danny was still by his side. Sleepily, Danny opened his eyes and smiled, “Hey there. You’re fucking gorgeous in the morning, anyone ever tell you that?”
“You’re the one who is literally hot, John. Wake up!”
John held Sherlock’s hips tight and pumped hard and fast. It took only a few minutes before Sherlock felt John’s release inside him. His master let him go, and Sherlock collapsed onto the floor, his arse stinging horribly. “You’re a fright now. Clean up. Shower. Lunch is in an hour.”
There was an explosion of scent as the omega did everything in his power to win John over. The room smelled of so many things, the dust and detritus from years of disuse were now becoming saturated in a heady mix of cedar and jasmine, of musk and something dark and faintly reminiscent of formaldehyde. John recognised his own odour mixed in with the lot, noting the hint of the desert he’d picked up when he’d been deployed for so long in the heat of foreign lands. It seemed to match well with the oak and moss base he was known for, the metallic tang of steel and the dusty flavour of gunpowder.
“No, though it was brilliant, and we will be repeating it as soon as I can handle it. What I needed was you, by my side. I can feel you, smell you, touch you. You make me feel safe, and when I feel safe, I can relax and rest. You do me good, just by being here. I do love you, John. You are every good thing to me. Merry Christmas, my love.”
Sherlock had experienced numerous orgasms because of it, tremendous size or no, John had given his omega so much pleasure with his cock that Sherlock had occasionally lost consciousness due to the intensity of it. “The rest of it was good, poor little broken alpha. He was ever so grateful for even the slightest amount of affection. Pathetic but fun, like a puppy from the pound.”
“Sherlock. Dating.
. John wasn’t going to hide the truth from himself any longer. He was head over heels IN LOVE with Sherlock Holmes, and tonight, he was going to let his man know it. “This is already the most perfect romantic date I have ever been on.”
Mrs Hudson sat in her kitchen and beamed at her new microwave. Her radio was on, loudly in fact, but she was cheerful as she listened to carols she’d heard far too many times. It wasn’t quite enough to disguise the racket coming from Sherlock’s room, and when they broke his bed it gave her quite a start but also a laugh. Happily, Mrs Hudson put together to hearty plates of food, wrapped them well and snuck them into the refrigerator upstairs. She left a large assortment of refreshing beverages, and a good deal of fruit in a lovely bowl as well. Her boys would need it. Mrs Hudson didn’t fret about not seeing them on Christmas. Mrs Turner had invited her over, and as far as she was concerned, the best present of all was knowing that her sweet boys had finally taken that final step to be together. This was a Christmas to celebrate and celebrate she would.
Sherlock knew the kiss was a risk but how could he not take it, not when all the signs pointed toward success and a success it was. John was actively kissing him once more, and it was everything Sherlock could have hoped for and more. John wasn’t passively accepting Sherlock’s advance, he was making some of his own if the hand on Sherlock’s arse was any kind of indication, so Sherlock boldly rubbed his hips hard against John’s, bending his knees a bit to get the level just right. The firmness he found there answered any question he might have had, yet, voicing them was more necessary as well. “You are every good reason to keep being here, John. I don’t need to know about the solar system because you are the centre of everything. All I’ll ever want is you.”
John said nothing but did smile broadly one more time and inhaled deeply. With a sharp nod, he took himself away and did as he was told. Sherlock smiled to himself as he listened to John showering and smiled even further when it went on for slightly longer than necessary for a fast washup. His suspicions were confirmed when John returned twenty minutes later wearing his second-nicest trousers, and his least hideous jumper. The soldier had also taken time to shave a second time, removing the afternoon stubble that he normally just ignored. “It’s just chicken.” An entire roast bird filled with a sausage stuffing, and accompanied by heaps of veg of all sorts, and topped with a thick rich gravy. John was nearly drooling by the time his serving was set in front of him.
, as always but it wasn’t heavy enough to cover the other smells he could make out. They were pungent and distinctive. Disbelieving as well as incredulous, John followed the trail right to the bedroom. The noises within were as unmistakable as the smells in the air but that didn’t stop him from being stunned when he pushed the door open and witnessed Mary mid-orgasm.
Sherlock wanted to throw up.
Sherlock sounded sated and shagged out, “Mind what?”
want to have sex with each other, we can have it when we’re sober. Maybe drunk first-time sex is not a good choice.”
Anthea smiled gently, “I imagine it’s because he was your friend first and he’s a bit protective of you, after everything. DI Lestrade is a man with a rather stern personal code.”
“No, thank you.” Mycroft said primly from behind them, “I will attend alone or not at all.”
7:40 am – John, answer the door.
John picked up the first glass the barkeep poured for him and tossed it back, setting it down after indicating the need for an instant refill. “Keep it coming.” John didn’t want to think about anything. He wanted to blot it all out. He wished for a mind palace of his own so that he could delete everything that troubled him and then, maybe blow the mind palace to pieces.
“John? John are you awake?
John kept Sherlock with his arse high in the air. Pouring even more lube to slick himself, John used his glistening fingers to push some into Sherlock’s anus. Without another word, John took the head of his cock and began to press it inside of Sherlock’s body. He wasn’t anywhere near prepared enough so Sherlock couldn’t stop the almost shrill cry that escaped his mouth. He bit into the bedding to keep even more pained noises from getting out because it felt like John was inserting his entire arm into his bum. “You’re even tighter than I imagined, just gorgeous. Now I
“Good, I know.” Mary sighed happily, still not seeing John by the door, “This reminds me of that time I took John to Suffolk and he never noticed that you were in the room next door so when he went to his conference we shagged in your room for the entire day and then…” David nudged Mary hard and now she saw. Her jaw dropped, and she scrambled off of him, David’s ejaculate sliding down the inside of her thigh to pool near her foot. Absently, John realized that it would stain their throw carpet, and then wondered if it had been stained previously and that he just hadn’t noticed the smell due to the preponderance of perfume Mary normally wore, “John, it’s not what it looks like, it’s not what you think…”
“I don’t know. This batch of the implant will make you heal faster. Believe me, it didn’t always work.” John looked at the deep scarring on the man’s body and felt his unease grow. Before John could ask more questions, company had arrived. A cleverly hidden panel opened, allowing the entrance of a large group of people. Most were wearing surgical scrubs, their faces covered in paper masks and safety goggles. John was reminded of forensic teams, and suddenly, he worried even more for Sherlock, his baby, Mrs Hudson, everyone.
His orgasm hit him like a freight train, knocking him over, and causing his body to spasm. Pleasure rolled over him and through him, spurting out from his cock in shuddering bursts, “Sherlock, oh fuck yeah, Sherlock!” John’s hand was flying up and down his cock and didn’t pause until the first shot of come was released over his knuckles. John held himself tight, jerking upward in short bursts to milk himself of every drop. Sherlock felt him pulsing inside, squeezing the come from his cock too, and he wanted the world to stop forever and hang in this moment. It was bliss.
“You seem brilliant at it, if she were darker haired, I’d completely believe you were her biological father.” Danny looked over at Rosie who immediately reached out to him. Politely, Danny shook her tiny hand and that seemed to satisfy her. Wriggling, Rosie squirmed enough to let Sherlock know that she was ready to run around some more. They made their way slowly toward a different section of the park, not really stopping until Rosie finally grew weary a couple of hours later and wanted to sit and eat her snack. He and Danny easily chatted the time away, sitting right by one another whenever Rosie gave them a chance to be still for a few minutes. More hours trickled away, and Sherlock wasn’t bored even once. “You seemed to understand everything she needs, and she barely talks.”
John was looking up at Sherlock, his mouth hanging open, “What has people
Sherlock led John to his bed, as promised, and tucked the exhausted yet mumbling doctor in. “Love you, Sherlock. I’ll suck you off proper in the morning.”
John pulled off for a second, “It’s so hot in here.” He pulled off his pyjamas and began to tear off the tattered remains of Sherlock’s candy coverings, getting to his feet to do so.
bit of my established morality matrix. Good day, Detective Donovan.”
John continued to read in a leisurely fashion, keeping one hand tangled in Sherlock’s curls, sometimes pressing down to make his slave gag a little on purpose, but otherwise just letting Sherlock keep going. His jaws were aching, so he rested them by using his tongue and hand to stroke and lick, drawing it all out for as long as possible. “This is really nice, but I think I want something different.” John stuffed a cushion behind his back as he arranged himself. Spreading his knees apart, John set his heels on the cushions, his arse exposed to Sherlock’s face, “Lick me out, keep at it until you’re fucking me with your tongue.”
“What is it, Sherlock? Has something gone wrong? What is it? I can fix it, I’m sure of it.” Whatever was bothering Sherlock, John would deal with it somehow. What kind of proposal could he be offering anyway? John often felt helpless when it came to Sherlock’s various issues, so if there was some kind of chance for him to do something that could help, he was all in.
“Tell me everything you know.” Sherlock demanded, “I will expect you right here in front of me as soon as you can manage, and you
Stretching out beside Rosie’s cot, John pulled a blanket over himself, shifted around until he was as comfortable as possible before closing his eyes. His mobile was clutched in his hand, Sherlock’s message still open, and a small hopeful smile on his face as he fell asleep.
“Vi, you’ve put him in a spin and we haven’t even had breakfast yet. Get the poor lad some coffee at least. The Dreadfuls are waiting at the table, can’t put it off any longer.” Sieger didn’t seem to be overly fond of his relations, “I cannot wait to see their faces once they learn that Sherlock is off the market for one of their inbred children. No Holmes fortune for them.”
The last present was large, and Sherlock seemed to have lost his voice as he pulled it out. “It’s a bug-out bag.” John showed Sherlock the various tools and other useful items contained within its small dimensions, and the medical gear that was hidden inside.
John sat in his chair and felt extremely proud of himself. All the gaily wrapped parcels beneath their tree were fakes, things that they already owned that he’d commandeered to make his gambit a success. Their real presents were hidden in his office at work. John planned to retrieve them early the next morning. Mrs Hudson had stumbled across something she called a “life hack”, producing a box of fancy teas meant to relax and soothe you to sleep. Sherlock claimed they never worked, but if he had a cup before bedtime, even if he sweetened it a bit, he would fall into a coma-like state for nearly six hours. John planned to trade out his secret presents in the middle of those hours. All he needed was for Sherlock to consume his nightly cuppa. John felt a bit guilty about this part of the plan but Mrs Hudson reminded John of
John threw up a second time, his stomach already empty, heaving and retching helplessly from an overload of emotion.
Instead of answering him back, Sherlock sent a text to Mycroft, “If it’s not too much trouble, can you send someone to retrieve my violin, my skull, and perhaps some clothing from Baker Street?”
Sherlock felt his hands being drawn together, and to his utter shock, John was kissing his fingertips, and pressing Sherlock’s palms to his faintly stubble covered cheeks, “Why are you doing this to me?” Sherlock’s voice was thick and raspy.
While Sherlock had been agreeable whilst in the offices, once they hit the streets he became irritable and snappish. John tried to find ways to cheer up his disgruntled mate, but Sherlock wasn’t having any of it. He refused food, he forced John to begin walking with him all the way back to Baker Street despite the fact that it was damp and cool out, and he refused to slow down, storming down the pavements as fast as he could. John nearly had to jog to keep up and he felt the fool as Sherlock remained two paces in front of him, “Slow down, dammit.”
. Mummy was
They continued to stroll hand in hand until John found a kiosk selling steaming cups of hot chocolate. They let each other go for a moment but then, Sherlock put his arm around John’s shoulder and John put his back around Sherlock’s waist, and they continued their slow amble. There were carollers to listen to so they did, sipping their chocolate and holding one another. Sherlock felt happier than ever and wondered how much happiness he could bear. It was almost overwhelming. When their cups were done and properly disposed of, John took Sherlock’s hand once more and led him away.
A short but aimless time later, Sherlock sat back on the stoop of John’s large house. He was smoking his fourth cigarette and trying to figure out how to break back into the home he had not been given permission to leave. He thought about knocking on the door in the vain hope that Mrs Hudson would hear but John would not. The anxiety he had soothed with his first three cigarettes had entirely returned when he realised that he was outside without a key.
If John had been stronger, he would have lashed out at the beta doctor who scolded Sherlock for allowing his partner to go hungry for so long. Sherlock swore up and down that he didn’t realise that John was denying himself food, then castigated himself for not paying closer attention. He then promised to attend John’s every meal
The doctor walked and thought.
. “I’m sorry about your friend, Danny.”
Sherlock
. Jealous. He was jealous and he loathed himself for being so weak.
John was wordlessly screaming his grief and pain, his fists beating against the glass of his cell.
my omega, Sherlock, but I am not your master or superior. I never could be, and honestly, I would never want to be. I am here for you to use however you want, as long as it makes you happy. I will be your alpha in any manner you decide is most fitting, and I will follow your command until my final breath leaves my body.” Not even marriage could signify the depth of this commitment.
. Even if Mycroft cut off his funds it didn’t matter. When John went through with his engagement to Mary Morstan, Sherlock had begun hoarding drugs, and making new connections, secreting away stashes in his many bolt-holes and hiding places all over the city. He could indulge at will if he so chose.
It made John a bit nervous. He didn’t want to make a big deal out of things, but Sherlock would certainly think him strange for just going out and buying some skirt for him. It wasn’t even Christmas yet, though it would be soon.
“We’ll just be on time for our reservation if we leave now.”
“You know that’s not it, Harry. I was so angry with Sherlock, I just, everything seems ridiculous now, petty.” John felt so ashamed of how awful he had been, and for so long.
“Indeed. Unlike my poor colleague, I have managed to gain enough power and influence that my tastes cannot be used against me. I am far above such worries where so many others are not. He was ill used, and I will very gladly help you strike back against those who saw to his end.” Sherlock had never seen Mycroft so openly vicious, “Surprised, brother mine? Scottie wasn’t a lover, barely a friend, but he was as good and decent a man as he could be. The bigotry that hampered him is steeped in hypocrisy since those that decry our inclinations are the ones who most often indulge in them. I’ve been keeping a weather eye out for many years. Danny, you have provided me with the most perfect of opportunities. I should be thanking you.”
“Yes, I know, my love, but I can’t. You know I can’t.” John helped Sherlock grip the massive toy and gasped along with the omega as he hungrily pushed the massive thing into himself with no preparation. Sherlock began to moan right away, flopping to his side as he pumped it in and out, and eventually going onto his back once more, his legs bent up and spread as wide as he could get them so that he could grip his hard cock with one hand and move the dildo with the other. Sherlock was huffing, panting out small cries as he tried to work the big toy into himself, but he was too hazy with lust to coordinate himself, and the omega was becoming distressed. John found himself reaching out and gripping the base of it, working it in and out, making small circles, and responding to every one of Sherlock’s wordless demands.
John fell asleep still worried. A long time later he felt a gentle finger stroke against his cheek. “John?” John made a sleepy sound but didn’t move much. “You’re going to have a sore arm as well as a bad back if you keep sleeping like this.” The finger stroked John’s cheek again and he unconsciously leaned into it. There was a second of hesitation but then, an entire hand pressed tenderly against his cheek, the thumb stroking along John’s zygomatic arch, “Wake up, John. I need to speak with you.”
“Don’t ruin this, Sherlock. Your arse is heaven. I could die right now, and it wouldn’t even bother me, that’s how good your arse is.” Sherlock laughed silently as Danny lay on him. He could feel his lover’s grin on his back for a long happy minute before Danny slowly pulled himself away, carefully ensure that condom was properly disposed of. “Don’t get me wrong, gorgeous, as much as I’d like to stay right here all night, I think it’s best if we clean up.”
John has made a difficult decision and is doing his best to be grateful as he moves forward. It's not going to be easy, but for Sherlock, every effort is worth it.
Let him? “Seriously?”
“Sorry, I don’t have a sofa to loan you.” John felt true regret at his lack of furnishing. He was enjoying the unexpected morning. “You could always kip with me.”
Now 49 years old and living with a flatmate yet again, John knew that this could be one of his last chances to find true happiness. All he had to do to attain it was drop trou. His palms were sweating, and his left eye was twitching with stress. John wasn’t sure he could do it. Tonight was possibly the most important night of his life, one where he would be crossing a boundary he’d never thought to reach, and he was wracked with anxiety over the possible fallout.
“Keep your apologies, Watson. It’s far too late for that, now.” Sherlock angrily wiped away his tears and stood tall. “Good
why!”
Sherlock passed out eventually, exhausted by his orgasms and the amount of effort he expended. He woke some time later with the soldier asleep beside him, his thick cock still buried in Sherlock’s arse. Writhing a bit, Sherlock began to rock himself over it.  It got hard and fat fast, and soon enough he was riding it with joyful abandon. He’d never felt so good. The soldier woke up and began fucking Sherlock hard once more, taking charge of everything they did, making Sherlock come whenever he wished. It was glorious. The rest of the day followed much as the night previous had. They stopped for sandwiches somewhere in the morning but that just led to exchanged blowjobs in the kitchen, followed by a little ride around the living room before Sherlock found himself back in bed being fucked almost savagely. He was in heaven.
,” her eyes were full of tears, “Oh, my dear sweet boy.”
, were far more numerous that memories of
about his orientation! Labels like that were meaningless overall, he knew it. It had nothing to do with being gay or not gay, John felt things for Sherlock because of who he was as a person, not because of his apparent gender. John had to get past his own limitations or be miserable and lonely forever.
Sherlock left 221 B Baker Street with his coat and whatever was in his pockets. After several hours of walking, he used his mobile to make a single call, “Brother? I need a room for a while, is that alright?”
Mycroft was silent for several minutes, obviously lost in thought. When he spoke, he sounded cautious, “I believe that we need to speak to Doctor Watson. I have the feeling that we are missing some key facts. Further, I believe that you will never be able to put this behind you until we ask those questions and get those answers.”
helping for free. He was
The doctor had stripped down to his vest, pants, and socks, but was sleeping on top of the covers. Sherlock swallowed hard as he witnessed the verification of a dream detail – John was extremely well endowed, terrifyingly so. For a brief moment, Sherlock was tempted to leave the bed, to hide in the bathroom, to be anywhere but where that monstrous penis was. Sherlock made himself look at John’s face, his real face, and reminded himself that this John was no danger to him. He would never hurt Sherlock as he had inside the nightmare. In a flash, all the mistrust and fear was gone, replaced with a deep affection because John was snoring in an inelegant way, and managed to appear chilled. “John, get under.”
When they reached their destination Sherlock tossed some money at the driver and led the other man inside, swiftly past Mrs. Hudson, and up the stair to his flat where he opened the door to a rather unexpected sight: John was already home and was sitting in his chair reading the paper.
Sherlock hesitated for a moment, “Yes.” John had the late shift at the surgery tonight.
Sherlock led the blonde outside and quickly hailed a cab. After giving the address he sat back in his seat and looked out of the window, he may be desperate enough to have gotten this far, but there was no way he was about to do foreplay in the back of a grungy London cab.
Sherlock felt hands on his cheek. It was moving quickly, in frantic movements. Who? Who would be worrying about him? These hands were much too large to be Mrs. Hudson's. Much too rough too. These hands they... they felt the size of John's… John’s hands...
“If you value your life you will not finish that sentence, Watson.” Sherlock bit out.
Sherlock froze momentarily as his throat tightened. He knew there was no possible way that John Watson would ever want him, but to hear him say he had feelings for another still hurt. Sherlock recovered quickly though, feeling his lab partner’s eyes on him. “Why haven’t you told her? Given your social status I find it unlikely for anyone to deny your advances.”
“The writing on the confession wall,” Sherlock began, his face turning bright red. “It was me.”
“Yes,” Sherlock half moaned. When John slipped his finger into the first knuckle Sherlock pushed down on it, trying to bury it deeper. “I’m not a virgin, John, you don’t need to be so gentle.”
Sherlock gasped just quiet enough that John hadn’t noticed. He knew John identified as bisexual, hell the whole school knew, but for some reason he hadn’t considered the possibility of the object of the boy’s desires being male. “Well, why don’t you just ask him?”
John could feel his orgasm drawing near, curling in the pit of his stomach, and he slid on of his hands from Sherlock’s hip to take his erection in hand and stroke it in time with the rise and fall of his hips. “John,” Sherlock moaned, his hips stuttering and the muscles in his thighs beginning to flutter. John quickly flipped Sherlock back onto his back and thrusted into his lover hard and fast, aiming right of the man’s prostate.
"Sherlock Please!" John begged. "Sherlock stay with me. You can't leave. Not again. I need you!" The tears were coming harder now. John tried to stroke his cheeks lightly. Only he was having a hard time because his hands were shaking so bad. "Sherlock, Lestrade is coming with help. I'm here. Please... I..I love you I'm so sorry."
“God, yes,” John moaned. Sherlock rose quickly from his position on John’s lap and grabbed the doctor’s hand to pull him along as he practically ran to his own bedroom. When they arrived, John quickly took control of the situation, grabbing the taller man’s wrists  and pinning him to the door; Sherlock had the upperhand in height, but John knew he had it in strength.
John nodded and laid his head back on the pillow, lifting his hips when Sherlock prompted him so the younger man could slid his trousers from his body. The detective slowly licked at the outline of John’s cock through his pants, mouthing at the width of him straining against the cotton fabric. “God, Sherlock,” John moaned beneath him, rutting his hips up gently.
“Sh-Sherlock,” John choked out through moans and gasps, “we should stop.”
After they were as sufficiently cleaned as one could be without a shower, John returned to lay beside his lover and took a moment to appreciate the number he had done on Sherlock’s neck. “You are definitely aren’t going to be able to cover these,” John said, suddenly a little bit concerned. “I guess I got a little bit carried away. I’m sorry.”
The paramedics rushed in and John let them lift the lifeless woman from his lap, trying to ignore the sympathetic looks they were giving him. Mary was gone long before they arrived, John knew that. There would be no bringing her back.
Sherlock sniffed delicately one more time, then pulled a face as if he’d scented something rank, “I estimate at least five, but only one has been her lover long enough to dispense with condoms.” Sherlock sounded bored now, and John wondered if punching David in the face would amuse his omega. “I’m not slut-shaming or anything because Alphas
“Yes, I do. You love it too.” Sherlock really did enjoy Danny’s company. He was only the second person that Sherlock had ever met who he liked to be with. Danny was amusing, sharp, observant, and ruthlessly driven when he was engaged. Danny was dedicated to the idea of re-educating John about Sherlock’s needs and was dead set on showing the soldier how to be with Sherlock properly. That they both relished their intimacy was merely icing on their reality cake.
John felt entirely unprepared for this encounter and he only had himself to blame.
It was obvious that his naturally dark locks had disguised him just long enough but the stunned look on the soldier’s face when Sherlock asked, “Afghanistan or Iraq?” made it clear that the man remembered.
. Still, if Sherlock was making this choice, who was John to keep denying it? He was hurting Sherlock either way.
John looked floored, his eyes a bit glazed looking, his face filled with disbelief,
“Pashmina.”
“Good to know,” John kissed the back of Sherlock’s neck, “This is not how I imagined things,” John sank himself deep each time he pulled out, “I imagined a lot. I never thought you’d allow me.”
. You don’t have sex with anyone. We’re drunk right now. Having sex would feel great but I don’t want you to hate me in the morning.”
you?” Sherlock demanded instantly, “Why don’t you know more about this place since you have that
“What about Rosie?” Molly shrugged helplessly. Sherlock considered her words and quickly reflected on his life. He was essentially stuck on Baker Street seven days a week, subject to John’s needs and whims. He
He didn’t realize that he’d spoken the questions aloud until Molly answered, “Since you came back. He’s known since then. It was horrible how he treats you now. I still can’t wrap my head around how unforgiving he is toward you. I mean, he forgave
“I think we should get up, go to our room, and conquer your fears together.” John kissed him then, and it was gloriously wet, penetrating, and overwhelming.” Sherlock found his body responding strongly, and suddenly, he couldn’t wait to have John beneath him, “Let’s go, gorgeous.”
It hurt. It hurt a great deal but not an insurmountable degree. In fact, Sherlock rather liked it. John’s cock was fatter than Sherlock’s narrow fingers and he was so very hard. Sherlock managed to insert nearly a third of it before John finally moaned and rocked sleepily forward. Sherlock exhaled raggedly at the push and allowed John to nudge himself deeper, not minding the sliding sting of it as his cock dragged against the sensitive tissues within. This went on for a good minute before all movement stopped and John’s body pulled back, but only a fraction of an inch, “Sherlock?”
be with anyone else. John remembered that he’d implied as much in the horrible letter-
“Harry!” John protested.
because they weren’t dating, so it wasn’t like they were boyfriends or anything, even if it felt like they were in so many different ways. John was proud of Sherlock’s physique. He’d made a concerted effort for months now to help Sherlock recover from the tremendous amount of physical trauma he’d undergone in the last few years, and it had taken a lot of careful planning to find a way for Sherlock to reach a level of health he’d never enjoyed in his adult life. He was covered in hard flat muscle, his body was lithe and powerful, and yes, he had the tiniest of swells over his belly but it could easily be dismissed as just skin but John knew it was podge and he was proud of that too. For the first time in his life, Sherlock had reserves on his body instead of being precariously balanced between barely-functional and almost dead from self-imposed starvation.
mess, and I’ve been completely undone without you.” John helped Sherlock out of his suit jacket and sat him on the edge of his bed. The doctor then puttered around the room, scooping laundry into its basket, and once he’d located clean pyjamas, John helped Sherlock change into them and then tucked the detective under his big quilt as if he were an invalid, “Close your eyes and rest for a few minutes while I make us some tea.”
paternity tests to determine its parentage because both John and I will know it was him. Unlike yourself, I don’t service just any alpha who comes along. I saved myself for the one I care for, the one who cares for me.”
After another solitary breakfast, John went to the assigned room to prepare his notes and the old-fashioned slideshow he’d brought with him. It was a little gimmicky for this day and age, but he’d found that the older technology was good bait for the attention of his audience. He felt queasy when he saw Sherlock take a seat near the back and felt even more ill when the same handsome man sat next to him. He was so busy trying to ignore Sherlock that he failed to notice that his presentation was completely full and that people were still crowding into the doorway as well as against the back wall. Professionally, he launched into his well-practised speeches, and mechanically smiled for every round of laughter and applause he earned with every scripted joke. When it was over, he got a standing ovation, but when everyone sat down again, he saw that Sherlock was gone, though his handsome suitor remained, a dissatisfied expression on his face.
“How could I not? You grew up searching for lost treasure, of course, you’d know about this trove but I doubted that you’d ever taken the time to actually come see it.”
your best friend? Where? When?”
, John Watson. May our paths never cross again.”
you have misgivings. I know you are worried about what might happen. All I am asking is that we try,
him to eat, the schedule merely indicated the timeslots allocated for certain meals. Sherlock had begun to let John eat alone since he ate only a fraction of what the alpha required. Thus unattended, John went about his plan to impress his omega.
When John walked into his house he wished he hadn’t left Baker Street. He missed the alluring smell of Sherlock so much that it felt like a physical loss. It made him feel that the incredible omega was truly his, even though it was a lie. Pushing open the door to his house, John stopped moving the moment the door closed behind him. He smelled
Sherlock stepped back, self-consciously smoothing down the front of his firmly buttoned-up jacket. It was new, and felt a bit odd because of it, even though it had been tailored at one of the finest discrete men's clothiers in London, “Uncertain.”
Throwing down a towel to sit on, Sherlock sat several different ways before he found a pose that was semi-comfortable enough for him. With red cheeks, he squirted a swirl of lube onto his hand and reached down to finger himself. It felt cold and strange, but he didn’t try to draw it out or enjoy himself. He just poked and prodded until he was able to fit three fingers into his hole. He felt stretched out but not in pain, not really. He found that the plug was quite heavy for its size and made sure to slick it heavily before trying to figure out the best way to insert it. He tried holding the base and pushing it inside himself, but he couldn’t quite get the widest part to go in. After fifteen minutes of pressing and twisting, his arm was sore, and his hole was aching more than ever.
“I always have.” There was no lie there and Mycroft knew it. John had been willing to go far beyond the call of duty on Sherlock’s behalf right from the day they met.
“Well, what do you want me to say, John? From what you’ve told me you have acted like the biggest arse on the entire planet. For fuck’s sake, John, what more can someone possibly do to prove how much they care for you? I don’t understand, I really don’t. This isn’t like you at all. I
“Madman.” John didn’t sound even a bit upset. “I love you, this is going to be great.” It was. Sherlock had never enjoyed the holidays but then, he’d never had a Christmas like this one, not one where he had a strong ardent lover whose appetite was as endless as his, whose endurance and creativity was rather breath-taking, and who knew exactly how to make Sherlock pliant and receptive, “Yours, Sherlock, I’m all yours.” Life could not possibly contain a greater gift than that.
“You’re good at this. I’m going to lay back, get back on my cock and ride me for a while. I like how your bum looks when you’re really going at it.” Sherlock wanted to roll his eyes with contempt but didn’t dare. Instead, he straddled John as soon as his master lay back. John enjoyed touching Sherlock’s back as Sherlock moved up and down, rocking his hips to make John’s cock slip in and out faster. “Spread your knees, lean forward as far as you can.” Sherlock did as commanded and gasped when John thrust up. The shock of unanticipated pleasure made his cock twitch. John did it again and kept doing it until Sherlock was as hard as he was. “That’s it my pretty boy, I’m going to make you come so hard.”
Cooking with Mrs Hudson was always entertaining. She was the one responsible for instructing Sherlock on the more basic of the homely arts, teaching him how to be self-sufficient on his own, something he’d never been taught growing up in wealthy isolation. Scrambling eggs for the first time had been a mess, but now Sherlock was skilled enough to take on complex meals, as long as she stayed relatively nearby to monitor while he laboured over adapting his laboratory skills to the kitchen. Mrs Hudson sat at the table, chatting while Sherlock did the actual work, providing her with ingredients to companionably prepare while he cooked. When everything was safely in the oven to slowly cook, they went to her flat where Sherlock helped the elderly woman with her coat and suitcase. Kissing her on each cheek, Sherlock bid her farewell, even sending his good wishes as well as a bottle of fine wine to be presented to her sister during their once-a-month regular visit. Sherlock had just enough time to shower and change into something casual, taking the time to shave himself closely.
Sherlock tried to argue the point but after opening and closing his mouth a few times he had to concede the point. John had shouted “not gay” a thousand times and no one had ever believed him. A reluctant smile grew on the omega’s face as he finally nodded, “True.” He sighed deeply, “Very well, John. We’ll wait the year to have our legal wedding.”
John didn’t hear the affection in his voice, the concern and tenderness, but Sherlock did and the omega in him responded. Their reunion might have been rocky, but John had always been there to protect and heal Sherlock, and those memories were in greater plenitude than the ones where John hurt him. Sherlock crept out of his room wearing his robe, bare feet silent on the floors as he ghosted to the bathroom and the tub. John listened carefully and heard gentle splashes as Sherlock soaked and washed. His heat would be uncomfortable, a nice soothing soak right off the bat would help mitigate some of the misery.
John tried to leave but found his arm being gripped by a large firm hand, “Doctor Watson...
“Perfect.” John’s expression was one of poignant happiness as if he were pleased and displeased at the same time, “No, that’s perfect.”
“You were with Mary when you began flirting with Eurus,” Sherlock said flatly. “You have it in you, John, you’ve almost done it before when you were legally married. We are
“Are you still there, Doctor Watson?”
Sherlock turned even more brilliantly pink and seemed to be literally squirming in his seat with discomfort. Drawing a deep but shaky breath, Sherlock finally managed to meet John’s gaze, “John, I want a beginning.”
“Sherlock, there’s no rush,” he tried to say but Sherlock wasn’t having any of it. “You’re hardly healed. You can’t possibly be able…”
John almost couldn’t speak for sentiment, but he had thought deeply about what he wanted to say today so he took the deep breath he required and got the words out, “Sherlock, I cannot ever express how much your return has meant to me, I will never deserve you, but I will spend the rest of my days loving you, supporting you, and being a part of your life in whatever way you will allow me. You have my devotion, forever.”
Sherlock smelled so good, so ripe. John knew that his omega was fertile, receptive, and he took good advantage of it. His cock had never been so thick, so long, nor had his knot ever swollen so large or become so hard. It all felt glorious and John’s ego soared when Sherlock orgasmed the first time. The bittersweet tang of omega semen filled his nose, causing him to fuck even harder now that he was pounding into a sloppy wet hole. Sherlock crooned and accepted it all, moaning John’s name as his body readied itself for another orgasm. John was breathing hard now, and he knew that their short session was nearly at an end. Sherlock’s proper heats would last for days but this heat would end right after John bit Sherlock the second time.
No, John wasn’t boyfriend material, and he no longer pretended to be.
Mary sighed, and pulled on a short robe, using a damp towel from a pile on the floor to mop her thighs off, “Look, John, I know you were with Sherlock this week, so why not just go with it. I’ll keep David, you keep Sherlock, and we’ll all be happy, alright?”
“Yes, I am.”
“Don’t thank me for noticing that you’re a gigantic arse! Poor Sherlock didn’t deserve your shitstorm, so now this is what you’re going to do. Danny is in, that’s just going to be a given. I know it’s a crap hand, but John, dearest brother, you’re going to have to accept him. What you want is for Sherlock to be happy, right? Ideally, you would like him to be happy with you, but for now, he’s happy with Danny. That really sucks for you, but you can’t be the bad guy here and try to chase Danny away.” Harry looked steadily at him, waiting for his answer.
Most of the time.
Even without a sexual component, Sherlock knew he was a difficult man to like, never mind love. He’s spent years keeping everyone away from him, locking his feelings inside, and pretending they didn’t exist. Now, Sherlock marvelled at John’s endurance. “I like how you make me feel.”
Still mostly sleeping, the doctor floundered around until Sherlock was able to tug away the duvet enough to flip it over his friend. John resumed snoring loudly and sprawled as much as he could. Sherlock shuffled closer and carefully lay his head on John’s shoulder, draping his arm over John’s waist, before closing his eyes. He drifted in a kind of hazy twilight for a long time before he fell all the way asleep once more, the fingers of John’s hand somehow buried in his curls. It made him sleep deeply for hours, and though Sherlock woke alone, he immediately perceived that John was occupied within the bathroom. He felt rested and even a bit hungry, “Takeaway? I feel like a good helping of
“Your fever clearly fluctuates rapidly. I’ll have to watch you.
John felt utter astonishment for the first time in ages.
Breakfast was eggs and toast for each of them. John made him eat two eggs, and then made Sherlock take vitamin tablets as well, “You’re underweight for your height.” Sherlock had never needed a hit so badly. John waved around a nicotine patch, patting his thigh to call Sherlock to him as if he were a dog. Sherlock obeyed, holding out his arm so John could stick his
It made Sherlock angry, understanding that John had punished him for so many things, things that were beyond Sherlock’s control, things he didn’t have influence over, despite knowing that Sherlock loved him, and even though John obviously loved him back. Fury took over.
“Yes, Danny.” Sherlock looked chastened before sitting up and looking directly at John, “It was good of you, John, to be so kind.”
. He just needed one more minute. “You can go, John.”
Danny slept in Sherlock’s bed that night, discussing with Sherlock to the various ways one could trigger an orgasm in someone else. He had taken Sherlock’s request to learn very seriously, discussing practical matters regarding sex in a candid and open way that Sherlock understood and appreciated. It wasn’t that he didn’t wish he could learn these things from John, he just had no expectation of ever overcoming John’s heteronormative repression. If they even remained friends now was a serious concern, so he knew that he gained nothing by waiting for John any longer. Danny seemed intent on imparting every kind of warning, every sort of anecdotal reason for precaution, and plenty of hands-on experiential learning, posing Sherlock’s body this way and that, and himself as well if necessary. He knew a huge amount about sex, and soon, Sherlock would too.
“Bite me, John. I want you to trigger my heat. I want you to seal me to you. I want to be the person who brings your child into the world. I’m ready for anything you want to have, John, because I love you so much.”
Sherlock didn’t pretend to be an expert on human social interactions, but he was fairly aware that citizens didn’t speak to slaves like they were equals, “Quite.” He didn’t know what to say next, so he said nothing.
Sherlock looked genuinely apologetic for making John wait so long and it was odd. The detective seemed to have no care for his own discomfort, setting the tea-service on the available bed-space and kneeling on the carpet next to John to serve him a steaming hot cup of tea. “This is lovely, thanks.”
John jumped as her door slammed loudly. He hadn’t expected to be dressed down so completely, or at all in fact. Now, John sat on the Lilo and began to think about what Sarah had said and what it all meant. The more he thought about it, the more foolish he felt. It really was obvious. He did care for Mary, but nothing like he cared for Sherlock
“I’m sorry, Sherlock,” John looked woebegone and remorseful. “I handled everything so badly and made you suffer because you didn’t understand what I was doing. You didn’t have all the facts and I was too caught up with what I was trying to accomplish to notice until you disappeared. Then I threw petrol on the fire by losing my temper and not thinking about what I was saying to you and...I’m an arse, a fool, a wretch, and a complete idiot because I hurt you so much. I’m sorry, Sherlock, please, I’m sorry.”
. You up for it?”
. Shame overwhelmed him and for a long shaky moment, John Watson wondered if his child and his friends would be better off without him in the world. It was a tempting idea for a moment, easy to do, impossible to take back.
Sherlock felt his mouth hanging open, but he wasn’t in control of his transport any more than he was in control of his mind palace, “Mycroft made sure you were arrested and kept in custody for as long as possible.”
The soldier.
John felt helpless and concerned, but as they walked briskly down the street, he realized that their footsteps were perfectly in time with each other and that the space between them had grown smaller naturally and easily. He could smell the scent of his friend and it made his brain dizzy with memories that flooded his mind, remembrances of past happiness. He couldn’t lie to himself. He did want this even though he was certain he did not deserve it. “Hurting you again would kill me.”
“I require your assistance?”
“Just…yeah, okay, there’s a good chance there, but at the same time,” Harry reached over and gripped his fingers, “He fell in love with
“Of Sherlock.” John nodded miserably again. “So why did you continue on with her once Sherlock came back?” John didn’t want to meet his sister’s gaze at first. “Oh Johnny, you didn’t. You did not use that woman to make Sherlock suffer more because you were mad at him?”
John continued to mull things over, not laying down, or even getting comfortable. He just sat there until three in the morning when he put his coat and shoes back on, left Sarah a thank-you note for the use of her space and for her input, and an apology to her alpha for the intrusion. John then slipped back onto the streets of London and made his way back to Baker Street. When he knocked on the door, there was no answer. He texted Sherlock but received no reply. John might have thought the flat was empty except for the sore-thumb of a vehicle that was Mycroft’s government approved transportation parked directly in front of the building. The Holmes brothers were inside but ignoring John.
“Of course not, dear. But you haven’t been well and –”
John looked confused.
Sherlock shifted a bit in the bed. “Sister?”
“Sheri was the worst shag you ever had.” The words just fell out of Sherlock’s mouth. His eyes opened wide as he remembered.
“What?”
“There won’t be a plan if you end up back in hospital.”
John couldn’t remain silent. “She’s not here, Kate.”
“If I give up now, it would all have been for nothing. This way, at least you know the truth and I won’t feel like a complete bastard.” He smiled a sad sort of smile. “Even sociopaths feel guilt on occasion. You’ll go on as before and we’ll find a way to meet when we can. And you’ll wait for me.” It sounded like a question.
John pulled Sherlock onto his chest and kissed him back. And any thought of a measured reentry into Sherlock’s orbit fell away as he laced his fingers through Sherlock’s hair, dipping his tongue into Sherlock’s mouth. He couldn’t get close enough. Sherlock snaked his hand between them and slid a finger under his waistband and John moaned against Sherlock’s lips. His hips rose slightly and Sherlock took John’s cock in his hand.
“Boiling,” Sherlock said.
She knew Moriarty had gone to great lengths to destroy Sherlock. Was Mary part of his plan too? And if she did work for Moriarty, why would she stick around after Moriarty died? Kate had stitched together a dozen different scenarios, each more farfetched than the last.
if I tidy her room.”
Sherlock smiled. “Biscuits, John. I’ll do anything for free biscuits. Including wearing this ridiculous disguise.” He lifted a baseball cap from his overnight bag and pulled it down over his forehead. “Voilà. The world’s biggest Yankees fan,” he said in his best/worst American accent.
John leaned forward and ran a hand up Sherlock’s thigh. “You deserved that.” He set his whisky glass down and moved between Sherlock’s legs. “And I deserve this.”
The room smelled like smoke. Cigarette smoke.
“God, I know I’m about to sound like Mrs. Hudson, so tell me to shut up if you like. But one thing at a time. He’s home. Worry about Mary and the rest of it tomorrow.”
“Sorry to disappoint you. I have to meet my girlfriend. She’s coming in tonight at 10. But you’re right about the case. I’ll get the details about the wire transfers from Sherlock tomorrow and head home in a day or so. It’ll have to be enough.”
She sent a quick text back home to Ottawa.
John came out of the shower and felt a hand on his shoulder, tugging him around and pressing him hard against the door. Sherlock kissed him, his tongue licking its way into his mouth. He pulled away finally and pressed his forehead against John’s. His breath came in soft gasps as he said, “I need you, John . .  . you understand that, don’t you?”
John helped him back to his chair, retrieved Sherlock’s phone from the table in the kitchen and handed it to her.
Why would Charlotte lie and say that Fiona was her sister? She must have known Sherlock would check. And why would a girlfriend wait almost two weeks? If Sherlock didn’t show up for tea, I’d be out looking for him before bedtime. Unless . . . unless it’s all just a bit of theatre.  I slip the picture back into the book and Sherlock appears in the doorway.
“I was only asking.”
Sherlock came hard, growling and biting against John’s shoulder. John loved him most in that moment. And he let himself believe that Sherlock loved him too.
“I abhor Starbucks,” Sherlock spoke, staring at the statue. “But that’s beside the point.”
“Do you play?”
“You came back,” Sherlock said quietly. “I estimated the probability of that outcome at less than 30%.”
He realised John had been talking to him. “If what’s possible?”
The only thing new was the desk clerk. He sat behind a wire grill, enveloped in the smoke of a fag that dangled precariously off his lower lip. He scarcely raised his head from his magazine to tell them they would find Vic Bellamy in Room 205. Ten quid would get them the key, he added.
They shook hands briefly. “Sherlock’s forgotten his manners, I’m afraid. I’m Simon Lockwood. An old friend.” He glanced at Sherlock. “We were at uni together. And you are?”
“He’s not dead,” he said out loud to his reflection, just to know how it felt to be able to say those words and have them actually be true. He switched off the bathroom light, and went to bed. He had no idea what was going to happen next, but for the first time in a long time, not knowing didn’t feel like standing on the edge of a cliff, waiting for the next strong wind to send him crashing onto the rocks below.
He’d also become his sister’s special project. After years of infrequent phone calls and even more infrequent visits, his grief had mobilised her into action. It was unexpected and unwanted and after six week of sessions with Dr. Thompson, mostly unwarranted. John had stepped back from the ledge and was once again doing what he did best – carrying on.
He heard Molly take a breath.
which he quickly remade into a daily paper very much in the image of
“Mary didn’t do this. She wouldn’t do this.” John sat up in the chair.
“Mary tried to kill you. Because you found out. And now you’re protecting her.”
“What are you talking about?” John’s voice was barely above a whisper. He didn’t want Mycroft to say another word. He knew it was the truth, a truth he had been studiously avoiding since he’d seen them at the window, his window.
But John’s heart, bruised and battered as it was, chose to believe something else.
John’s hand lazilystroked Sherlock’s chest, over his stomach, down his side. There was a bruise there, a big one, almost healed.
I stand and set the book back on the nightstand. “That’s one theory.”
Sherlock frowned. “I thought—”
“Ahhh. Lucky you.” John put the phone on the table and warmed both hands around his teacup.
“Here.” His body was black against the window, then invisible, slipping into bed beside him.
Sherlock looks confused but takes the pot from John and carries it into the flat. He sets it on the floor by his chair. “I don’t have plants, John.”
“I know you’re trying to deduce your way to a solution, Sherlock, but you’re just out of hospital and you have a rather compromised perspective about this.” His expression softened. “You have too much skin in the game to be objective. You know I’m right.”
Sherlock nodded and took the key card. He reached out and straightened the rose in John’s lapel.
She looked up. “Are you telling me because you want tea or because the noise is bothering you?”
He was confused for a moment, thinking disjointedly that he shouldn't be cold; there was a good reason why he shouldn't be cold. Then he realized that there were no blankets, and he remembered tossing the covers away, saying to John, "Who needs blankets, you're basically a space heater," as he lay back down, curling around John, both of them warm and sweat-slick. “Call in sick again tomorrow,” he’d whispered in John’s ear before falling back to sleep.
“A shite case that you managed to solve despite my inept attempts.”
He continued to cough, a terrible wet sound. He lowered his hand from his mouth and it came away bloody. She felt useless, standing there watching Sherlock struggling to breathe. If John didn’t call 911, she would.
I can never tell.
“What’s next?”
John stood and took Sherlock’s hands in his. “Is all this babbling a yes?”
that the Regiment later claimed were staged. The detainees who died in custody. The Regiment closed ranks and no one would testify against the Corporal accused of abuse. He was never convicted.
Sally waited until he was finished reading. “Guess I’m not the only one who thinks they’re shagging.”
She checked her phone. 9:45. No message from Chloe. No sign of Greg.
He leaned his head against the door and counted to ten. At nine and a half, the door swung open and John stumbled/fell into Sherlock’s chest. Sherlock let go of the door and grabbed John by his shoulders. John tried to get his feet under him, but he was too far forward and only managed to propel them both farther into the room.
I laugh. “It’s called shag.”
“It’s about John,” she said.
” Sherlock nodded. He then placed their order in fluent Chinese.
A ghost of a smile flashed across Sherlock’s face. “A nine, at least.”
Sherlock stared at him. Mycroft recognized the look – Sherlock was about to surrender.
Ella had the decency not to speak, a raised eyebrow the only indication that she was still on the clock.
“I told you what I want to know – the night Sherlock—”
“Should I be worried?” John asked.
Maybe it was the morphine, but he was a terrible liar. “Good try, Shezza.”
He ordered a whiskey. “A double.”
Sherlock sighed and leaned forward. “I’m trying to think. Why don’t you tell me everything you need to say now, and I can get back to it.”
Intermission was over.
“Because I don’t know what you’re up to and I know it’s all going to come crashing down around us and despite that, all I want to do is take you into the bedroom and fuck you for the rest of the day.” He leaned in and kissed Sherlock hard on the lips.
Sherlock touched his neck. “Just a flesh wound.”
“Fuck you.” His voice drained away, forgetting what he was going to say. He came back to himself to see Sherlock studying him. He was unsettled by how blue Sherlock’s eyes looked even in the dim bar. “I can almost understand Harry inviting you. Now that
John wished he felt as sure. Usually, when Sherlock proclaimed something, no matter how preposterous, John could be sure it was a fact. Or that Sherlock would make it a fact. This time, though – when he could actually feel his body shutting down –
“Is he awake?”
John frowned. “What plan?”
John cracked open one eye and looked at Sherlock. “Really? Now you need me to think? Now?”
John took Sherlock’s hand and led him into the kitchen. “Whisky or tea?”
I was right about most of it. There are still some details to work out but the basic facts are these: six months ago, Fiona Miller, the over-educated, under-employed assistant to the Shipton Building Society controller , approached the  Major Economic Crimes Unit and told them she suspected that Washburn was setting up dummy corporations and then approving mortgages for them. MECU was working with Fiona to build a solid case before arresting Washburn. Two months ago, Fiona auditioned for a local production of
She was standing in front of a vending machine, trying to decide whether she should risk her life on either the egg or cheese sandwich when John finally appeared. “I wouldn’t. But on the plus side, you’re already in A&E.”
“I’ll go fetch the coffee,” John offered and started dressing. “I think the girl at the counter fancies me, she gave me free biscuits last time.”
“Goose. My mother always serves goose.”
“What do you understand, Sherlock? Do you understand how insane all this is? Not only did my pregnant wife shoot my . . . you . . . but now we find out she was probably fucking Moriarty? And god knows what else – Christ, for all we know she was at the bloody swimming pool, hell, she was probably the one who was going to put a bullet through my head if you didn’t jump . . . Kate is right – this is so fucked up.”
“Do you miss . . . them?”
“Sorry.” He rubbed his hands together. “Here comes our food.”
“Kate. I always think of Clousseau when someone calls me that.”
“Cheers.” I get up and retrieve the bottle and the other glass.
“Is that why I couldn’t see him yesterday?”
His face coloured and he slammed the glass down hard on the table. “Grow up, Kate,” he said loudly enough that the couple at the next table turned to stare. “You stumbled into this mess. Only it’s not your mess, is it? It’s Sherlock’s and John’s. Let them deal with it.”
“My father was a doctor. My mother too,” he said around a mouthful of potato chips. “I don’t remember ever deciding to be a doctor, everyone just assumed, so I went along. Sherlock accused me once of always letting other people decide what I want. Not that he ever let me choose.” There was something in his expression she couldn’t read. Regret, maybe. He stood suddenly and headed down the hall. She heard the bathroom door close and the sound of running water.
“Yeah, well, you won’t be after I tell you the weird part.”
“No. But I am not convinced he survived the rooftop. I witnessed his death.”
She picked up her briefcase and purse, and opened the car door. She stepped out and watched the car pull away. “And fuck you too, Mycroft Holmes.” She retrieved her phone from her purse and scanned her contacts. She dialed the number quickly.
“Inspector Bryant. Yes.” She gave herself points for not giving in to the urge to say “
Sherlock yawned. “It’s a small price to pay, I suppose.”
“You’d be more comfortable if you stayed here,” he told John. “We can do a better job of managing the pain. Is there someone we can call for you?”
It was a typical late spring afternoon, brilliant sunshine one minute, dark clouds skittering across the sky the next. The rain started midway through Mike Stamford’s short, awkward eulogy.
Greg brings him something in a paper cup, a bottle has been found in someone’s drawer. He drinks and takes a deep breath and another and finds that these deep breaths are really just withheld sobs.
It was during the programme’s technical challenge that he first noticed it. Just a little itch, a tickle in the back of his head, like a door rattling in his mind palace. It was like when he couldn’t solve a problem even though he knew the solution was right there under his nose.
Sherlock looked out the window. They were on an ordinary street. 313 was an ordinary flat in the most ordinary of neighbourhoods. He paid the cabbie and walked to the front door. A man – late fifties, reading glasses pushed up on his head, greying hair in need of a trim – answered the door on the second ring and, after some hesitation, let him in.
John had come home with the puppy five years earlier. He said it was for Sherlock’s birthday, but he was the one who’d always wanted a dog. From the start, Bella tolerated Sherlock, but loved John with a devotion that stalkers could only aspire to.
“Then it’s settled.  For as long as I can manage it, we do this together. I need to get dressed, hand me my trousers.” He reached back to untie the hospital gown.
There was something in Sherlock’s voice that stopped him saying what he was about to say. Something about what a bastard Sherlock was and why would never—could never—forgive him – but all he managed was, “Oh for god’s sake, just sit down.”
“Well, I’m not sure I should be talking to you, but you did say if there was anything . . .”
He hesitated and Kate knew he was deciding how much to tell her, what percentage of truth to insert between the lies. “That his wife was Moriarty’s girlfriend and likely his accomplice? No. He found out sometime after they were married that Mary was not what she appeared to be. She told him that her real initials were A.G.R.A., but that may have been a lie too. I didn’t know about her connection to Moriarty. Not until yesterday.”
“And the only reason you’re not in jail is because Mycroft saved your ass. That must have killed you – accepting help from your brother.”
John let his head fall back on the pillows, closing his eyes, his hips jerking upwards as Sherlock’s mouth closed around his cock. He came too fast that night, in a sudden burst of heat and grief, embarrassment rising up with the pleasure. He’d been willing to reciprocate, but Sherlock had shook his head, sat up, drained the last inch of whiskey from the glass John had carried to the bedroom with him, and walked barefoot to the bathroom. John lay on his back and watched the lights of passing cars dance across the ceiling like ghosts.
There was a link to the wedding photos. The pictures all looked they were shot on the set of a cozy romantic comedy – the kind that usually starred Colin Firth and Kate Winslet. The ladies wore large hats and for some odd reason John and Sherlock were dressed identically.
“She was always after me to wear a bloody kilt,” he said. “Amazing the barmy things you do when you’re in love.”
There was no answer. It was not a request. It was a dismissal.
. Tell me how he liked his tea, or what shows he watched on telly. Anything.” She stood and dropped the notebook on the table. She walked to the window and stared outside, her arms folded in front of her.
Kate stood with hands on her hips, furious.
John was stationed in Afghanistan when his when his father died. He understood nothing about death by then, except that it was random and cruel and inevitable.
The lift doors opened and he was about to step in when Harry stepped out.  She squared her shoulders when she saw him, wiped her eyes. He had put off telling her, but not for the reasons Lestrade had accused him of. Telling her to come was admitting he couldn’t fix this. He stepped into the lift and held the doors open with one hand.
He was still standing there when a cab stopped in front of 221B. A woman – familiar despite the darkness – stepped out of the back seat and slammed the door. He heard the bottom door open and close, followed by loud footsteps on the stairs. “Sherlock, I think we’ve got a visitor.”
Sherlock is antsy. He doesn’t say much, but I can tell something is bothering him from the way he keeps rubbing his hands against his thighs.
Sherlock scooted over a bit, giving John more room. He pulled John’s hand to his chest. “In order? Morphine, tea, maybe a biscuit . . .”
“No disrespect, Vicar, but just go away.”
John pulled his hand free and turned to face him. “You’re only guessing.”
Sherlock let go of his hand. Reached up and wrapped his hand around his neck and pulled him down, kissing him lightly on the lips. John pulled back and Sherlock caressed his cheek. Ran his thumb across John’s lips. “Sorry.”
John laughed and leaned over to kiss him, but he’d already fallen asleep.
Sherlock leans forward and catches John’s mouth in the middle of a word, the middle of a breath, the middle of a heartbeat. It's everything John remembers and everything he’s lost.
He missed John too. Missing John was a constant nagging ache since the day John told him he was moving with Rosie to take a position at a small surgery in Sussex. They needed a fresh start, John said. Why the hell did a ten-year-old need a fresh start? Rosie had flamboyantly whinged about changing schools and houses and friends until John promised a puppy in return for a smile. She’d been whinging successfully ever since. Sherlock stayed in London and kept working, calling on John for the occasional consult. When Rosie went to uni, John had quit his job at the surgery and started writing full-time – a series of crime novels he set in London. His protagonist was a brilliant doctor, and although several inches taller and at least one stone lighter, he was clearly John. In the novels, the doctor spent much of his time pining for a former nameless colleague. The most popular question John received at book signings was “Will they ever get together?” Sherlock had never read them.

When John tells him, he keeps his voice light.
John looked at Kate. “You teach him this?”
and her long brown fingers flew when she talked. She was nervous, stumbling over phrases like hepatic encephalopathy, serum aminotransferases and bilirubin levels.
“Then why are you here? What do you want from me? From this?”
I’m standing by the sink, cutting strawberries for cereal when he finally appears. He smiles and my heart does a little flip-flop. Still. After all these years. He’s too thin by half and he walks slow and stiff, like his brain isn’t on speaking terms with the rest of his body yet, but at least he’s walking again. He stands beside me, his bare shoulder pressed up against mine, and kisses me on the cheek. Then he lifts his arm to turn my head and we kiss like we used to. And he tastes like toothpaste and he says I taste like strawberries. We forget the tea and the cereal and go back to bed, and even though it isn’t the same as it was before, it’s still us and we still get where we want to go, even it takes us a little longer.
Sherlock opens one eye, murmurs something unintelligible and sighs, curling into John’s touch. Like always, John feels a hot coil of anticipation tighten deep in his belly. In the beginning, they couldn’t be bothered with a bed. The slow striptease of seduction hadn’t been necessary – they’d done it in the shower, in the back seat of cabs and on the kitchen floor. They’d joked about lost buttons and broken shoelaces and talked about swearing off zippers entirely.
The vicar appeared outside John’s door three days after Sherlock’s funeral. He stood in the hallway, fingering his collar nervously. He reminded John of every eager medical student he’d  ever trained. “I thought perhaps you might – “
is what that bark meant. Fair enough.
Kate came around and sat in John’s chair. Sherlock looked pale and in pain. “You okay? You’re sweating. Do you need a pill or something?”
Sherlock felt John’s hand through his pajamas. Warm. Real. He stared at John’s neck. Wrinkled, a bit of white chest hair peeking out from the top of his shirt. He sat back down.
Sherlock nodded, then asked “Will you stay? Tonight, I mean. I gather all this –” his hand made a circling motion around them, “— indicates you’ve forgiven me. Again.”
“Everything all right?”
“This is Beverly Ashcroft.”
“I don’t know. I doubt it.” Sherlock stood unsteadily. “But a timely visit to an out of town cousin may be in order.” He got as far as the fireplace, stopped and put a hand against the mantle to steady himself. He leaned forward, breathing hard.
John took a stumbling step backwards and Harry was there, putting out a hand to steady him.  “The fuck she did.” He turned to Harry, “Is he lying?”
“Do you charge by the bloody word?”
“Not even for you, Sherlock.”
Sherlock raised an eyebrow. “Not everyone remains so vigilant.”
, hmm?” John smiled as Sherlock pouted, relieved anew that his omega wouldn’t be left unattended. He kissed Sherlock one more time to fortify himself, and then was driven home in Mycroft’s car. The driver said nothing, but he did raise the cab divider and rolled down his window for the duration.
, “I think you’re making a terrible mistake, Sherlock.”
“That’s not all.” John took a deep breath and confessed the worst of the woman he’d planned to spend his life with, “Mary had a terrible secret. She was an assassin! She
“Don’t call me that.” Sherlock sounded incredibly offended but at the same time his cheeks pinked and his face had a very happy look to it.
any.”
John worked himself into a fit, hyperventilating once again, and finally falling to his knees to press his forehead to the cold floor in an attempt to calm himself. He’d been in here for far too long already and had flushed the toilet ages ago. Sherlock knew he was done in here and was probably wondering what John could possibly be up to. Finally, he couldn’t put it off any longer though he tried. He brushed his teeth. He washed his face. His final stall was to give himself a quick wash between his legs, though he was certain it wasn’t going to be necessary. Sighing with regret for what he was about to lose, John sadly dragged himself to the bedroom.
“Are you insaner than I already think you are?
. You need to be better with Rosie too. It’s time to grow up, John. I’m saying this because I love you and because you’re stupid. This is your misery bed that you made with your own backward brain, time to lie in it. Listen to me. Go back to 221 B Baker Street the way you should have done after your wife died and be with Sherlock. Yes, Danny will be there, and no, you can’t just keep dropping your daughter off with different people. You dated people back when you were first there and Sherlock managed somehow, you will too. You are going to mature, you are going to go back to doing the right thing, you are going to succeed at being
Sherlock looked down at him, his eyes dark and glistening, “I’m not saying I forgive what you did to me, because it was unforgivable, in my opinion, but at the same time, I would rather not live the rest of my life in desolate isolation the way I have been. We can be happy together, I know it. I believe it. Believe it with me, John. Perhaps I am making a disastrous mistake, but it’s what I am choosing.”
“So, you’re already a professional dad as well as a consulting detective?” Danny’s tone was flirtatious, and Sherlock realized that he really, really didn’t mind.
John’s eyes were red and damp with emotion and Sherlock felt something twang inside his chest. There was still fear there, certainly, and a bit of doubt too, but his memories of
Sherlock was almost unhinged with passion. He licked John everywhere he could reach until he made his way back to John’s arse. Making the older man kneel, Sherlock used all his considerable skill to tongue John open. No one had ever lavished such attention on John before, it had always been him doing whatever he could to keep his date in his bed. Sherlock was holding him open, his long fingers spanning their entire surface easily as he kept his cheeks wide apart. John couldn’t help moaning, it all felt amazing. Soon he was loose and extremely wet, the saliva from Sherlock had been spread around generously.
He was the most surprising human that Sherlock had ever come across. “I did, I do, I mean, I want to tell you. If you really want to know.”
Sherlock looked away, a faint blush on his cheek, then immediately descended without another word. John nearly trailed after the detective but he knew that Danny was in the shower and that as lovers, Sherlock was likely to follow him in, and John just wasn’t ready to hear them go at it. Instead, he got himself as ready as he could in the privacy of his room, laying on his bed and just waiting for them to leave. Half an hour went past before he heard a soft baritone whisper, “Later, John,” followed by the sound of the door to the street closing.
John had grown bolder since Sherlock had first awakened. Hand-holding was a frequent occurrence, even in company. Sherlock found he needed that anchor, he needed to be connected to the constant warmth and security of his friend. John often stroked his fingers through Sherlock’s hair, soothing the tension away wherever he could safely touch. To keep strangers from crowding the healing and alert detective, John changed Sherlock’s dressings himself, removing bandages with such care that the detective never experienced one unnecessary twinge of pain.
“It’s no problem, John.” Sherlock replied, walking towards his desk to finish John’s paper. John turned off his lamp, leaving Sherlock’s brain rattling nosily in the dark.
“I.” No words formed in John’s mouth. “Just fuck off Phillip.”
Ive planned the entire fic and you guys better be strapped in for a rollercoaster. I think there's gonna be about 20 more chapters.
“I’ve got the match tomorrow. I was gonna ask if you wanted to come.” Sherlock stopped pacing, running his hand through his curls.
Sherlock felt John's stare and looked over to him, catching his eyes. John resisted glancing down and instead held Sherlock's eyes in his own. Sherlock was sitting directly opposite John and if he lent forward, he could touch him.
As they tail gaited the rest of the class, John wondered if Sherlock thought he was hitting on him. From his answer, it must have seemed as though he thought John was, which made John want to cry. It was pure curiosity, nothing more, and now John had ruined what could have been a potentially good friendship.
John tongued and fingered Sherlock for ages, not stopping until he was able to sink three sturdy fingers in easily. Sherlock had long since lost his ability to remain quiet, panting and making strange little sounds as jolts of pleasure caught up by surprise again and again. It was so strange to cede such control over to his friend, to allow John the freedom to do as he liked. Sherlock’s transport was grateful, and each inward push of those clever fingers wrung a groan from Sherlock’s lips, “You’re so bloody perfect.”
“She’s not old enough to vote!” Sherlock protested again.
The wretched thing was wide enough to graze across his prostate, teasing him. Whenever Sherlock moved, it rocked back and forth. If he sat, it pressed firmly. If he stood, it dragged at his anus. In the end, Sherlock found that the only way to be comfortable was to lay in bed with a pillow beneath his hips. The plug pressed in via its own weight, but it was the least stimulating way to keep himself. Sherlock opened one of John’s medical journals and began to read. He made his way through a dozen articles before his eyes slid shut and he began to nap.
Sherlock took the puzzle back and set it on the table, “How does one begin? Is it random drawings, like a lottery? Is there a system? How do you go about it?”
“I’m pregnant.” John shouted, running the few steps it took to grab up his mate to spin them about, “John!”
Sherlock didn’t want that. He didn’t want to feel good while John raped him. He had no choice though, John knew Sherlock’s body better than he did, using all his specialised skill to stoke Sherlock’s unwanted arousal until his slave was moaning steadily. “John, please.”
“I know, Sherlock, but I’m asking anyway. Please, my dear, do me this favour?” She was smiling so tenderly, so earnestly.
“John, I want to have a physical relationship with you, an exclusive one. I realize now, stupendously late in the game, that you have feelings for me, too, and my own words and actions have led you to think that I am incapable as well as uninterested in having more to do with you than friendship provides. This is not the case. I do want more. I have always wanted more. I was trapped by my own self-delusion. I am no emotionless machine. I am a man who is deeply in love with you and I need you in my life in as many ways as possible, John. I feel safe around you. You keep me right in so many ways, you are an extension of myself. I am broken without you. I cannot live with less, not as I am, and I know it’s probably not the best way to cope with my many traumas but, John, please, sleep with me and not them. Share my bed and not theirs. My body has always been yours to touch as you please. You have kept me as hale and whole as could be managed, considering who I am. Take your pleasure with me, share it with me, let me experience it with you. I want that, very much. I want to sleep knowing that you are right there by my side to help me when I need it, to rely on because I do…I rely on you. I know I’m demanding, selfish, needy, shattered, and a right mess, but I am begging you, John, choose me.”
...he threw up again, his retch of despair anything but quiet.
. Groping his bedside drawer a bit, Sherlock managed to reach his industrial grade medical lubricant, and waved it in Danny’s general direction, “Your arse is so pretty, all of you is so pretty. You’re so strong, so lovely. I can’t wait to absolutely destroy this little rosebud. I’m going to come so deep inside you. I want to hear all your sounds, every moan, every cry. Let me have it. Let me show you what to do, what you’re going to do to John one day.”
The strain around Sherlock’s heart eased but Sherlock was a bit confused. He was a master of reading body language, but the one that John’s body spoke was a code he had not yet broken. John’s expressions were bold, varied, clear, and an absolute mystery.
He walked for a long time before all the noise in his brain settled down to a disgruntled murmur. John forced himself to look at how he’d behaved since the day Sherlock Holmes came back to life. John did not care for the man he saw, and no amount of mental editing could hide from John the revelation that he’d become a bully as well as an ungrateful
Sherlock felt his cheeks unaccountably heating. John had said as much many times before but tonight, it seemed extra difficult to restrain his natural reactions. “Thank you, John, but if one of us is mad, it’s you. You’re the lunatic that ran off to war on purpose and who decided to live with someone he didn’t even know, that he met in a morgue of all places, only a day after they were introduced. Absolutely everyone we know thinks I’m disturbed, yet here you are.”
The omega registered their intent to wed the moment he felt prepared enough or attempted to. He had not expected the formal letter denying their application and had stormed off to the government offices to complain, his alpha by his side. The representative behind the counter had not been impressed by his loud deductions and aggressive stance, “You are an omega, sir, your partner is an alpha. The United Kingdom does not possess a legal process that weds those genders together. If one of you were beta, then yes, but pardon my bluntness, you’re supposed to
With John’s help, things progressed quickly. The doctor had found Wiggins in his den, sick near to death but clutching a small baggie in his hand. He gave it to John before the ambulance took him away, and the contents therein were carefully examined by Sherlock. Lestrade was advised to seek out a pleasant-faced woman with connections to a volunteer outreach program. She turned out to be the mother of a young man who had lived a life filled with drugs and alcohol and had ended up on the streets where he’d perished. In her mind, those that also lived on the streets were somehow culpable for his death, ignoring the fact that the life
“I told you, I have very specific tastes. Today is a very good day for me, so sit still a little while longer like a good boy, and I'll get you some nicotine patches as a treat.” John was making note of the marks inside Sherlock's elbow, going so far as to take his mobile out to make a photographic record of all of Sherlock's parts. John took nearly two hours to complete the exam to his own satisfaction and Sherlock's cheeks burned crimson at the mere memory of having John's latex covered finger checking the condition of his prostate. The medical lubricant had been mostly wiped away, but Sherlock couldn't ignore his awareness of how some was still inside, and that no one, not even he, had ever touched that part of his body before. “Ours
John didn’t need to dig far to recall that not so long ago, he was busy deliberately ignoring everything that Sherlock did. “You’re amazing. That’s just, amazing. I don’t know that it would work for me, but I may give that a try.”
for you, and way more than as friends. He now understands that he could have had you if he hadn’t spent so much time being a dick. He’s
“Sherlock!” John was standing there, his hands on his hips, frowning straight at Sherlock. His doctor’s eyes took in the guilty demeanour, the trembling fingers, and Sherlock’s ashen face. To Sherlock’s surprise, the anger disappeared and softened right into concern, “Right then, what happened? Did someone bother you? Who?”
Sherlock gasped. He knew what he was looking at! Sherlock turned and looked at John who was standing next to him, grinning up proudly, “How did you know?”
Lestrade was at breakfast the next day, and he was relentlessly cheerful. Carelessly, he bussed Mycroft noisily on the cheek before setting a large plate of fried food down in front of Sherlock, “Eat up, big day.” Sherlock didn’t feel like eating, but then, he never did when he was depressed. Still, Gregory had punched John on his behalf, so gamely, Sherlock managed to find room in his tummy for a generous percentage of what had been offered. Lestrade looked proud and Mycroft looked grateful. “Go on, wash up. Once you’ve showered and dressed, we can go.”
been friends, which was more than Mary could claim with some of the company she kept. Why he’d sat through several dinners with her alpha ex-boyfriend David with
“You’re awake.” John was sitting there, eyes open, his gaze fixed on Sherlock’s face. A series of emotions flickered across the smaller man’s face before settling on relief. His smile was huge, and John’s eyes twinkled with happiness when he said, “Hello, Sherlock. How are you feeling?”
For some reason, John had assumed Sherlock would still come on his own. Danny had been unexpected and unwelcome, even though John had agreed to see them both. Reality had been harsher than he’d prepared himself for, but then John reminded himself of all the times Sherlock had interacted with Mary.
fault that this case, and who knows how many other cases, have gone on to bad ends. How many people have died while you haven’t worked, Sherlock? How many people have been lost, or things of value used against someone, or just…just…” John’s shoulders bowed, and he stood hunched over the sink, obscuring his face from Sherlock, “
“Man up, David,” spat Mary, “Stop being so fucking weak, you know how I hate that.” She tried to stab her knife toward John’s wounded leg but he stepped aside easily enough.
“That’s why you were so scared when you woke up because, in your mind, I’m some kind of monster.” John sounded blank. He had let go of Sherlock’s hand too, and Sherlock could feel the warmth by his side moving further away, “I’m sorry. I’m making you…I’m sorry.”
“Yes, but for now…”
about us got to do with anything?”
“I’m happy, too.” John realized he wasn’t lying. The last few weeks had brought him such change. He’d gone from being completely miserable to being on the path to utter happiness. He had been given a second chance! His endless upset had faded each day until he barely felt the discomfort any longer. He’d put on a couple of pounds as well, something the tailor had been advised about. John’s new suit was cut in a way that would continue to flatter him as he slowly regained his previous physique.
Sherlock wasn’t allowed to do more than walk sedately, needing support from John while he did so because his muscles were like jelly,
. “I love you so much, John.”
It was like an addiction now. John spent days browsing shops looking for a top to go with the skirt and all the rest. There were a million shops and he was losing track of which ones he wanted to back to visit again when he found it. It was sleeveless but otherwise looked a great deal like the white button-downs that Sherlock favoured. “It is particularly effective if the wearer has broader shoulders, and hangs artfully even if she’s not full-chested.” explained the clerk, “It emphasises the gracefulness of the bared arms and the fabric is deliberately cut to allow for more natural movement.”
The gods weren’t fair, though, and John continued to live. He stood to use the toilet, and while he peed, John looked at the source of all his misery.
“Sherlock…”
, I am scum.”
“How do you know, Sally Donovan? I’d have to say that I’ve put a rather large amount of effort into my ill-fated friendship with Doctor Watson and have earned exactly nothing for it.
back. Apologies were meaningless, he didn’t want one from John. Apologies wouldn’t undo what had happened. Reality didn’t work that way.
Resolved, he drank a hot cup of tea while he dressed, carefully filling one of Rosie’s numerous travel bags with two days’ worth of necessities, and then took a taxi to Baker Street. Rosie was already upstairs, but Mrs Hudson made him come in for breakfast, which he quite welcomed. Just as he was done, John heard Molly Hooper arrive. She had taken to popping in to check on Sherlock, and since she loved Rosie dearly, to play with John’s daughter for a few minutes before she too went to work.
Sherlock’s mask shattered and suddenly, the man in front of him looked years younger, devastated, and full of pain, “You. I want you back.” John gaped at Sherlock, stunned further as Sherlock tried to discretely wipe a tear away, “I
“We’ve never actually spent Christmas together, how do we suddenly have traditions?”
“John?” Sherlock couldn’t speak. He was completely incapable. He felt wooden and almost detached from his transport. Distantly he noticed that Mycroft had discretely exited, leaving he and John alone together. “John!” Sherlock pulled his love close to his chest and wrapped his arms around him, burying his face in John’s hair and breathing him in. Two strong arms returned his embrace, and Sherlock realized that he was crying once more. This time it was relief and happiness, but he still needed to gasp for air and use his fingers to wipe the tears away, though many fell and disappeared into John’s hair.
find them, Danny, I swear. We’ll make them pay dearly for what they’ve done to you.”
Sherlock blinked. “John knows what?” Sherlock’s fingers were twitching.
John was finding it difficult to think. He was entirely hard already and they hadn’t even really kissed. John kicked the door to Sherlock’s door open and nearly threw the detective onto the bed. John fell forward and found himself being pinned to the mattress mere moments before Sherlock’s mouth crashed against his. It was the most consuming kiss he’d ever experienced. It was perfect in every way, from the sweet taste of it to the passion it evoked. John found his appetites whetted to a fine peak within minutes. Breaking apart, they panted as they tore away each other’s clothing.
