"It would have the advantage of…." This time, the pause is longer, and when Dean finally looks at him, Cas is frowning into the middle distance.  "Privacy, which would last for as long as it took someone to open the door."  He tips his head back thoughtfully, and damned if he doesn't look amused.  "To nurse you back to health, of course."
?"  Cornelia nods shortly.  "Gaius Sempronius Gracchus was a very great man."
"Wendy's an expert with infusions," he says.  "I would like to personally recommend her work to anyone who needs to relax and likes citrus."
"That's it?" Dean asks quietly, and has three sets of unreadable eyes fixed on him.  "Anything else I should know?"
"Awesome," Alistair murmurs, leaning in for a quick kiss.  "Any luck, it'll be a while before your Brothers' next visit.  Especially occupying the same space shit: how the hell they missed that…."
"I saw the snow sink behind you," she answers, walking over to extend a hand and pulling him to his feet.  "You stilled but didn't move, which means it was too close for you to simply retreat.  I couldn't be certain I would be accurate shooting it if I couldn't see it, and since it was focused on you, I--"
"Alicia volunteered because that's her job," he interrupts. "Helping is what we do."  He hesitates then barrels ahead, because why the fuck not?  "Look, since we can talk about it now--what happened?"
"He's not just a demon," Cas answers. "He's King of the Crossroads.  He was heir of the oldest demon in Hell, and he is for a demon very young and was even younger when Lilith chose him.  Ruthlessness in this case must be leavened by judgment, and that includes recognizing the potential for use of anything or anyone he may need to advance or hold his position against all challenge.  Killing for pleasure is of course a wondrous way to pass the time, but so is ruling the entire Crossroads and being the most powerful demon in Hell.  He won't kill anyone with any potential use to further his ambitions, protect his position, or cause problems for his enemies.  I may be useless on two of those, but the third--I'm a guaranteed at minimum annoyance to Lucifer simply in existing."
it now, even if they didn't before.  If it's drawn again in their presence and they see it--"
He spares her an incredulous look--subtlety is not his forte--but to his relief, Alison doesn't pretend she didn't hear them.  "Just talk," she says very quietly, turning sideways on the bench with a sigh.  "Teresa usually meets with the Alliance mayors and the ones who lead the field workers and they're fine with her, but the others--some of them are just curious, I guess, and with the all the new people around…it's just people wondering things, that's all." She looks at Castiel with a faint smile.  "Mood says 'weirded out but not hostile'. I think."
"So," he says into the awkward silence, "it's about time for dinner.  I'll cook."
"It is," Cas agrees huskily, voice softening enough that Dean would have missed his next words if they weren't so close.  "I'll miss it."
Rolling on his back, he stares up at the ceiling; it's stupid, but he wants to go home.  He wants to sleep in their own goddamn bed with the squealing springs announcing any too-hard breathing, he wants to wake up to the smell of coffee and Cas resenting mornings while cooking breakfast, he wants to drag his ass to the shower and spend his first hour of the morning talking to Cas about what's going on today.  He'll listen to Cas's efforts in turning their militia camp into a digital utopia with consistent plumbing while doing the dishes, look over his shoulder at the updated patrol schedule, check out the drafts for new cabins, and next week they'll start pouring the foundation for the mess, and Dean's looking forward to that.
"Accepted," Erica answers. "The truce has begun; you have ten minutes to arrive or I'll consider it broken."
"Yeah," he says, throat tight. "That sounds about right."
He tries very hard to remember that insomnia makes humans irritable.  "I don't know."
"You are kind, Emet," Cornelia says, smiling and extending her hand, which he rises and takes eagerly.  "Please offer the Ambassador my thanks as well."
Vera straightens to a vague facsimile of attention. "Yes, sir."
"What he said," Alison interrupts, and as the goddess turns to look at her, Castiel shares a helpless look with Sudha.  Somewhere (where is she?), Teresa just realized her life partner is challenging a god but can't do anything since she's trapped in time.  It will not help her mood when she finally sees Alison again.
"None of it makes sense," Cas says brittlely.
Up ahead is a school bus and a van that ran straight into it, hood half-buried beneath the tail jacked almost five feet off the ground.  He tries to decide whether to go over the narrow remains of the hood or around and try to get through the scraggles of brush.  As they reach it, Dean glances back and sees Andy and Jody just hitting the ground by the cars, and Alicia and Matt are on the truck and from the angle of their guns, firing right down.  "Holy shit."
"It was very fair."  Castiel waits until she looks at him.  "I didn't think it mattered what I did because it wouldn't change anything."
were doing, Dean.  Five, maybe ten seconds."
Kat looks at Andy in bewilderment.  "Andy?"
"Oh yeah," she mutters into her jeans.  "That.  Helps."
"Vaccinations--Alison said the other children didn't even know her birthday.  She's approximately two and a half years old.  Ichabod was just settled then; why would they already have children without parents that needed vaccinations?"
"Brenda and Damiel were in the mess when we were heating up the chicken," she explains.  "Had some time to kill, so caught up on the news and gave them pie.  How long has that been going on, anyway?"
"I'll get right on it."  Annoyed, he takes in the pleasant pastoral scene around them, sheep baaa-ing, the sun shining, the grass--being grass, he guesses, it's green, anyway--and comes to a really unpleasant conclusion.  "You're dreamwalking me.  Coma-walking me, whatever."
"Why should he get to?" Dean retorts. "Cas can't."
"He wasn't and isn't an assassin!"  Dean flinches, and Castiel has to fight down the spurt of inexplicable guilt: Luke will never cease to taint everything in his life.  "Dean--
Cas turns his head against his knee, and the incredulous look almost makes Dean laugh; fuck, he missed him.  "You'll let me leave?"
Blood-matted brown hair registers, a (very) (familiar) face, and Dean's hand clenches in the edge of his coat from its creep toward his hip; it happens like this every time, he's always too late, he always finds him already dead....
, but they only eat humans or those infected with Croatoan.  It's not required for their survival, however, so I assume it's an issue of taste."
Revulsion spirals through him, but he makes himself do it and has the horrified satisfaction of feeling it scramble backward, hovering watchfully. He focuses on shopping center to the east and feels it leap eagerly to obey, taking it apart to the foundation and sewer system beneath it almost effortlessly (a screaming soul on the rack slowly dismembered by inches by his own hands).
Dean isn't sure if it's a relief or not when Cas says, "Tell me the plan again, as you refer to it."
"She had premium cable and pay per view," Cas explains, like that makes it okay when--
"Please don't save any personal files to the hard drive; you'll be issued a jump drive for that. Speaking of, these are your five jump drives," Cas said, presenting them to her a lot like a cat does dead mice; like you're supposed to be happy about it.  "Alpha is to be used for patrol reports only, beta for required updates and revisions to the patrol schedule and report database, which is updated every Sunday and you will need to acquire from me before dawn on Monday, gamma for any private documents, delta for regular backups of your system in addition to the automatic weekly backups, and epsilon for any intracamp data exchanges including pornography both visual and textual."
"Cas…." He stops there, stumped on what comes next.  There's just so fucking
"You're telling me the greatest general in history was descended from the goddess of
--knowing who I am and taking notes the entire time without anyone noticing.  They live three to five to a cabin; how the hell would they hide it?  For that matter…."
"Knife dances aren't meant for combat themselves, obviously; they're an exhibition of skill, and their major use in training is to teach the movements and build muscle memory until they become reflexive," Cas continues. "Usually, the transition is difficult for students, even extraordinary ones, but Alicia grasped the connection almost immediately.  Once she knew the whole, she could pick out the individual parts of each dance and assemble them with very little effort when she started translating it to combat.
"Are you into women?" he asks.  "Or were, I guess."
"That's not what I meant!" Dean almost looks uncomfortable.  "Cas, look, I didn't--"
"Yeah, you can.  You can break it later, I get that, but you're gonna promise anyway, so I can pretend to believe it.  Give me that much, Cas.  It's not so fucking much to ask."  Dean looks away, licking his lips.  "Your life, your choice, I get that, but it's not zero sum, never is.  You're not the only one who has to live with them, Cas; I do, too." He's still circling that statement when Dean adds, "Anything else about this I need to know?"
Giving him a sour look, Matt drops on the blanket on Dean's other side with a massive sigh of relief.  Alicia is one of the most consistent volunteers for digging duty, and her team--due to interest, loyalty, or Alicia's sheer force of personality--join her every time.  Andy and Matt's determined attempts to match her energy have so far been unsuccessful, but Matt, at least, has yet to declare defeat, and has the blisters on top of blisters that Alicia treats regularly to prove it.
"I don't want this, Cas," she says, starting to sound frantic: fear, the most dangerous thing of all.  "I could hurt someone--"
--and while he'd learned to fight in it, he didn't become human when he Fell: actually living in it was all new.  The echoes of this Dean--and by extension, John Winchester--and the hunters that trained him are always there when he's fighting, but it occurs to Dean now that it was from everyone in Chitaqua--watching, interacting (in every sense of the word), and even training them--that he learned all the ways he could use it, and make it his own.
"Good idea."  Dean plays with the cup for a moment before cocking his head.  "So, you wanna hang out here or check out what else everyone's doing tonight?"
Yeah, he's not up to hearing that pretty much ever; the Jane and Risa thing was enough, thanks.  "How noticeable are we talking about here?"
No hunter could even think that without a flinch, and Dean's no different.  "Yeah."
New doorframes, sanded floor, painted walls, all in a room Cas hates from a time he doesn't remember in a cabin Chuck wasn't allowed inside after getting books from Bobby's: plenty of perfectly legit reasons for all of it.  He just wishes he knew which of those totally legit reasons it is.
Dean grins at her. "Good call."
"The altar had a burnt offering," she answers with a shrug.  "That means little: it was consecrated to no god and therefore to them all.  I assumed it was for Gaius's safe return, but when they came to me for permission to dispose of it, I remember being surprised at how sparse the ashes."
"I doubt it," she says cheerfully.  "No worries: I got it under control. Did I mention I really want a catapult?  We could make one."
"You don't like witches." It's not an accusation exactly, and Dean hears the question under it.
That was a long time ago (it's now, it's always) and he knows now what it means to be human.
"Yeah, no shooting her," Sean says blankly.  "She actually thought we would?"
"Erica's, I think," Micah answers, looking for all the world like he's in a courtroom instead of sitting on a sagging cot.  "From what I heard, Luke was considering it already, however. He and Erica went together to the Crossroads the first time.  They waited for Stanley and Terry to agree before telling them the rest of the plan."
"Anyone but you, that would sound cynical," Dean observes.  "I have no idea here, though."
"You mean the rest of my life I'm gonna be getting these?" He really doesn't want to think about that, but considering the prognosis at one point was 'will die in the next five seconds', he's really gotta think positive here.
"Fifteen minutes."
"I don't even know how to answer that," Cas says finally, looking helpless.
He nods helplessly. "Of course," he agrees.  "I should definitely stay while everyone who Sudha doesn't require here leaves."  Looking at Vera carefully, he tries to decide how much time she has. "Dean, if you would, perhaps Karl or Lewis or Dolores should be told?  About the baby."
"It is my recommendation as second in command of Chitaqua that we do not ask," Cas answers with a finality that makes Dean wonder how much of this is actually about Alison's mental health.  "I also recommend that if she should offer, we refuse, politely of course."
Walking back out, he snaps his fingers, restarting from the top and setting the whole area for observation only, then reaches for Cas, keeping half his attention on the border.  "I gotta see the design," he tells Cas. "Deep breath: this will only take a second."  Meeting the clear blue eyes, he checks one more time and finds the block again, easing between it and Cas and follows it to the source, holding them both in his mind. All at once, he takes apart the block and pulls in the entire Pit to blow everything straight where it came from; from what he can tell, that hurt.  Cas sucks in a startled breath, relaxing against him as Dean cleans the remains from his mind then shows him what he got from the four idiots' minds . "Your Brothers needed mules: they provided. It won't happen again."
"Experience and a great deal of guessing.  The military would be the least expensive if they were able and willing to make a deal similar to the one Dean made here; however, that would depend on the practicality of the commanders.  The oil companies are the most reliable source and the most convenient.  They have passthrough credentials in all the contiguous United States, Canada, and Mexico, means of transport, and can quickly deliver to any location we indicate.  Further, they would only charge the currently black market price of triple the already ridiculously high legal price of oil per barrel, which would be a bargain compared to the border's three hundred percent markup when they're feeling generous."
The sound of a gunshot echoes through the clearing, and Alicia stumbles backward into Erica's arms, and Castiel catches a glint of metal just as Micah collapses back onto the ground with a grunt.  Much like outside Ichabod's walls, with the break in Erica's concentration, so does her control: everyone drops to the snow
"Yeah," he answers honestly.  "I mean, above and beyond you're the only person who even knows I'm here, it'd be shitty to show up and find someone shot you in the back for the glory and the dream of running a camp low on toilet paper."
"There was a speech--several of them, I think," Cas answers to his utter amazement.  "If I wasn't high when he gave them, they assured I was afterward, as quickly as possible."
"Okay, yeah, I owe you an explanation, fine."  She frowns at the street for a moment, looking--guilty?   "Look, it wasn't--Amanda said you weren't into crowds, okay?"
"I do, Dolores had some for hazardous medical things and shared." Pulling it from a pocket, she shakes it out and sliding the map inside before sealing it shut.  "Now--"
"You didn't notice anything this morning?" she asks. "Not like Alicia hides her feelings.  Ever."
"I look forward to it.  Tell my household I'm not to be disturbed, please."
"Dude, you're slipping," Dean observes, absently stroking Castiel's knee in a way that's the opposite of soothing, fingers just approaching his inner thigh before retreating. "Only seven: I heard you can get to fifty without even trying."
He's watched her with Cas, knows every weakness and the fact she doesn't have many and most are related to dealing with someone faster and stronger than a human.
They've done some damage to the level of alcohol in that bottle when Alison says, "It's not just that, though."
That was three days ago; two days ago is when he learned the only thing that he was right about was the view, and wow, Cas was right about the weather being weird these days.  Clammy chill to blizzard in four hours or less: if it isn't a record, it should be.
"Twenty-two," Dean answers glumly, taking another drink of now-cool coffee; Sam just left for Stanford and Dad was being Dad a little too much for close contact without the potential for patricide.  "One of my first jobs on my own.  It was late, bartender in Las Cruces mentioned something going on west of McAllen, thought I'd check it out."
Walking toward the closest wall on the left, he watches the pictures form: Demeter in dark grey gown and tunic, wheat-blonde hair threaded with streaks of grey, in the home of the gods on Mount Olympus before the twelve thrones, shoulders slumped as Zeus turns away from her appeal, the other gods ignoring her altogether; Clytemnestra in mourning black, standing before her husband's throne, face twisted in grief and hatred and anger as Agamemnon looks over her head in stoic refusal with his court unseeing, uncaring of her pain; Hecuba in exile from fallen Troy, kneeling in an echoingly empty temple, prayers unheard, offering unaccepted, the acolytes pretending she's not even there; Medea in Hera's temple, blonde hair in disarray, demanding that she fulfill the promise of Jason's devotion and dismissed without interest, her letters to her friends and family unopened and unanswered; and the last; Cornelia in a stark white
"When you arrived at Chitaqua, Dean found you," he says before he can stop himself.  "What did he do to you when he took you to his cabin?"
"Holy shit that's creepy," Dean says wonderingly, taking an appalled drink. "Anything else?"
"Gambling is the art of chance, which is--among very limited minds--an explicit denial of the will of God," he explains to an unexpectedly rapt audience of one.  "To call upon luck was thought to be a form of idolatry; to privilege chaos over order, or evil over good, to put it in the simplest and least accurate terms."
"A couple of weeks," he admits. "But--"
"Human lives."  He takes a deep breath as the memory of the circle burns itself into the backs of his eyelids, glowing sickly white and putrid yellow-green, carved into the snow around an isolated town, maybe, one that didn't get the message to run and each route coming to Ichabod was careful to avoid.  "Part two of the Ichabod Plan.  Part I; find out if that circle even works.  That was why the demons are still involved, or at least part of the reason.  The kids from the church were supposed to be the test case, make sure the sacrifice worked and if it did, how much power they could get so they could do the math for something bigger."  He looks at Cas.  "Much bigger."
. If she can do that--"
"Why the fuck would you want to preserve...." Dean's eyes travel down to the neck and stop at the sight of sliced grey tendons and neatly sawn bone.  "That's--that's someone's actual head?  Someone's
"Then let's get this done," he says impatiently.  "What are you waiting for?"
"Anxiety, nervousness, paranoia, makes you cranky and prone to stupidity," Alicia confirms.  "That's why I said not competent, our creators; that geas was designed to make people run--with the timeline they were on, there was no time to fuck around.  From what you said, though, our action here wasn't 'run' for no one is hysterically running in place but 'be super afraid so you will run'--very different thing grammatically, am I right?--so it hit the first button it saw and that could be anything.  For us--can't prove this--our reaction isn't to run from it, but--"
"I very much enjoyed his company at dinner," she answers.  "My acquaintance is vast, and I explored it. I would not cause you pain, however."
is what you heard?" he interrupts in exasperation.  "I apologize; my intentions were to display empathy and understanding.  I won't make that mistake again."
; treachery is to be expected.  However, for one, she'll be limited by the terms, and two...."
.  You're gonna be less than that when I’m done--"
"Think of one, then." He frowns at the closed door.  "It's very strange to be the one to mete out discipline to others rather than endure it."
Cas frowns blearily from behind a fall of disastrous bangs; it's goddamn adorable. "I wasn't asleep."
.  "It was deliberate."
, were a job--a much more difficult one, granted, but still just a job--that he learned very, very well and he would walk away from once he was done, ready for the next one.
"It wasn't always clear," he answers evasively, "but that could be that during your more vocal periods, I tried not to listen too closely.  It was unsettling."
Cas hesitates, eyes following Dean's penciled lines uncertainly.  "I don't know how much time they'll need to be thorough.  If it can be done in five days--"
In the courtyard, Teresa's bleeding hand has already crossed the outer edge, cutting through each precisely chalked line from perimeter to inner circle, and Cas echoes it across every fixed memory at once, each stroke cutting the bindings as cleanly as a cauterized wound.  It's seconds, hours, forever; the church walls and floor rising up around them as the original flares to shrieking, bleeding life before it collapses into light, two and a half years of existence burned away in a breath.
"So I understand," Crowley agrees with fading hostility. "The design seems to prize quantity over quality."
"And half of Chitaqua's hunters, at least until the rest arrive."
"And found out some things can't be bought." The Crossroads could make them faster, stronger, luckier--Christ, he should have figured it out then, Micah said it straight out--better shots, but they couldn't make them into fallen angels in a human body; they could be loyal, devoted, obedient, ruthless, but they couldn't be someone else.
Castiel didn't know Dean's ultimate purpose then--and not for the first time, he reflects on the weaknesses and strengths of the Host's secrecy--but if they told him to assure Dean would be returned to humanity whole in body but irreparably shattered in essence, it would have changed nothing.  His obedience to that point was unquestioning and absolute, his faith without flaw, and he would have understood his instructions.  There would have been no difference except in one thing; he would have committed his first act of disobedience within the bowels of Hell, and the Host would never have known it.
"Every time Teresa's late getting back, I remember how a few of the people in that town looked really sketchy last time I visited. And why did they want her back so soon, anyway?"  Alison takes a long drink, shaking her head.  "Kind of suspicious, don't you think?  No one mentioned those new vegetable experiments at the last meeting; I wonder if there's a connection?"
Weirdly enough, it's not Amanda's agreement that makes him feel better, but that Cas actually asked someone.  And in this case, not just because she was a witness, but as a hunter.
He only debates for a moment; if he can help, he should.  That's not even a question.  "One of their corporeal forms is canine," he says, and her eyes widen.  "Hellhounds raped Cynothoglys to breed them, but no idea how many.  Cas thinks they may be patrolling all the lands and paths of the dead, including the gates of Heaven, but there's no way to tell. That's all we know right now."
"Can we win?" she asks quietly.  "Don't sugarcoat it; I don't need to read your mind to know if you're lying to me."
A movement to his left gets his attention, and he sees Alicia, flanked by Jody and Matt, watching with tears streaking her cheeks as she says each and every name, and wonders if she's thinking of the children from isolation and the burn for them she didn't attend; of Andy, still in Ichabod's mortuary and waiting for the day they can burn him in Chitaqua.
"They don't trust us," he continues, putting it together. "They don’t know us, and our actions may help them, but they can't trust us, because they don't know who we are, why we do it, or if at some point we'll--demand payment for it and deny them our help if they refuse.  Even if we've never done that before."
"I assume the same person who warned her of the penalty should a psychic misuse their abilities."  Dean can't help but think of the bathroom this morning and wonders how the hell Cas thought what he was doing in front of that mirror was anything but mimicry, and shitty at that.  Half-slumped in a ragged armchair, rumpled and looking bored, Cas doesn't need anything but himself to be exactly what he is.   "And informed her of who had the right of judgment."
"They made offerings in my name; I took them," she continues, revulsion filling her voice.  "Their supplication, I heard it; their worship, I accepted it.  I endured, to see them destroyed, until nothing of them was left but a memory. My burnt offering was all that I was; it was nothing."
The events are somewhat hazy after that.
"No," Castiel says before Amanda can answer.  "You're not."
she worked out what was going on with the migration, before she figured out what it was that caused it.  Before he found out she was Erica's tactician.
"The maid says a freedman, very kind, was in this house and would meet her in the kitchens once per
"And my army?"
Alison's eyebrows draw together.  "Why would he…you're saying Lucifer had a
"Got it," Joe says, closing the door, and Dean has just enough time to acknowledge--
"Do it now," Dean whispers hoarsely.  "Before I'm dangerous to anyone."
Utilizing his already excellent reflexes, Castiel catches the full cup before Dean drops it.  "Not on you, of course," he explains, giving the cup to Alicia.  "We just thought--with the lack of active combat--that everyone's skills regarding watching for unexpected threats may be degrading."
"We'll be in Ichabod for at least five days to accommodate the Alliance meeting," Cas says.  "During that time, as our teams will be taking regular shifts with Ichabod's patrol, someone needs to be authorized to act for Dean and I when we aren't available.  Amanda and Kamal will also be assisting, but Amanda's students will take priority when instruction resumes."
"Cas?  You okay?"
"Yeah, hindsight's a bitch."  He tilts his head back, thinking.  "And I lived.  Not bad for a Fallen angel, though kind of shitty for a god."
Until this moment, Dean entertained the vague hope that he was actually in a shitty dream after too much Jack or something, but that's blown out of the water.  Apocalypse, sure, random fucking time travel, fine, but Chuck able to pick up a gun--and
Not strangled enough, if the sudden appearance of Dean crouching in front of him is any indication, hand on his handgun. "Cas?  You okay?"
"How's the north road?" he asks, though he's pretty sure from Cas's expression he can guess.
"It's not the height of the bar," Cas intones, solemn as a judge at an execution, "but that you clear it.  You do so regularly.  Well done."

"So I'm practically invisible in here."  Dean turns to stare at the doorway, then at Cas.  "That
Tony blinks slowly.  "Say again?"
"You'd think that," she agrees, cocking her head with a startlingly penetrative look at Cas.  "And you'd be wrong, so many kinds I can't even count the number.  You were catalyst, not cause, but the problem is, I don't have cause--see what I mean how this couldn't have happened like this?  No?  You will, and now we are gonna get so interesting you will cry from lack of boredom in your life: I interviewed our five crazy-murder-death people again early this morning in the infirmary." She makes a face. "Not morning people, gonna say.  Very cranky and not a little hostile."
"I'm meeting with them alone?" Dean blurts out before he can stop himself.
"What happened?"  Leaning back in the tub, he frowns, oblivious to the cool of the water and his own goosebumps.  "Ichabod.  There was an attack."
"--and my wife's," Micah continues impatiently, and Dean's still enjoying being petty as shit when 'wife' penetrates.  "She was a frequent visitor to our cabin."
) and getting a piece of string and projecting (it was fun).
"Thank you," he says softly, shaking off the remaining dizziness as he climbs to his feet; the others immediately freeze in place. "I've waited two and a half years for that."
She raises an eyebrow.  "You want to talk about it?   It's rare these days to say that to someone and not be ironic."
"What, you didn't notice?" he continues, swallowing back more laughter; seriously, what the fuck, Joe?  "Going gets tough, we sell souls, doesn't even have to be our own.  Friends, enemies, teammates, whoever's closest, I guess, we're not picky.  Christ, we do it better than Crossroads; I should have asked Crowley about that."
"No, of course not. She simply didn't see any problem with it," he answers flatly, moving a red candle slightly left and trying not to look like he's rediscovering the stress headache.  "She thought it was very funny."
"Cas--"
"No way," he announces of his own free will before all the world and Cas.  "Whole set of lights behind me to replace while I'm up here.  Just need to turn around."  This post is not that big, and he's not sure that's possible since he's not a former gymnast or Cas.  "Give me a minute."
Dean nods impatiently. "Okay, yeah, you went there and removed your memory after."
"Right." She tilts her head.  "You want to talk about it?"
He looks down at her in surprise.  "Nate?"
Right, one of these conversations.  "What's going on?"
.  Fortunately, it was within our discretion on which human structures and items are allowed to stand in the event of a major smiting event, so we were able to wipe every trace of his reign from the earth and for reasons I feel no need to explain, the remains of all civilizations in existence at that time.  Not that he left much of them."
Vaguely, Dean's aware of Cas reaching for his left hand, and the feel of something soft and wet on his palm eventually connects to Cas's tongue.  Forcing his eyes open again, he catches the last few seconds of Cas's obscenely pink tongue slide the length of Dean's fingers before wrapping Dean's hand around his cock with a catch of breath Dean will never forget.  Covering Dean's hand with his own, he slides his fingers between Dean's and pins them both to Dean's stomach before he starts to thrust.
"Maybe," he says grudgingly, not willing to confirm for some reason of his own.  "I still got a lot to learn."  The subtext is unmistakable;
"Contamination," he murmurs, focusing on the third frame, currently empty.  "There we go."
"If you want worst case scenario, you need merely ask," Cas interjects so smoothly that only belatedly does everyone turn toward him.  "The most powerful telepath to walk the earth enslaved an army, and they conquered the world in his name."
"Yeah, no, that's just hippofucker being--I don't even know."  Dean sneezes in resignation.  "Okay, let's get it over with."
Chuck shrugs, failing at casual.  "I pay attention."
He stares at Dean, who looks back with beautiful unconcern.  He would probably do it; peel off his (now favorite) jeans, pull off his (their?) t-shit, and the only mystery will be if there's another layer to consider.  He's rarely if ever noticed clothing other than the need to wear it; now, he can identify particular favorites as showcased by Dean's body.
. Pick up your goddamn pen and get to writing already, and by the way, you know the answer to this question, so what are you waiting for?
Sitting back on his heels, Cas surveys him with a frown, and for no reason at all, he's suddenly, vividly aware that Cas is kneeling between his legs.  In a room that Dean has visually confirmed there are orgies, and in plural.
."  Joseph nods firmly.  "Get someone to photograph every room and do a full inventory of what they've got first.  Better if you can get it off their systems, but if their generators are out, we'll worry about that later.  When you're done with that part, this is a salvage operation; start with rations, gasoline, ammunition, and weapons, all you can get in one jeep, but take good notes.  Eventually we'll get everything they got."
He marks twenty-one faces; those he could see clearly, the vague ovals of those he couldn't see well enough, but none of those he couldn't see at all and could never count.  He could hear everything, however; each pair of boots on fall-withered grass and bare dirt; each stuttered, rapid breath; the click of the safety of each weapon.
"Cas doesn't get sick, and has infinite knowledge, a perfect memory, and nothing to do but take patrol reports and watch you sleep if you're not awake to keep him entertained," she continues with fragile composure.  "He's inventing a whole new plane of hypochondria by proxy and sterilized the entire kitchen three times today, and Dean, even I don't know why.  I hid my books, but it's a small cabin and that's not gonna last long, and I can't do anything about infinite knowledge."
"I will," he lies, tightening his arms.  "It'll be okay. I promise."
He's distracted enough by sheer irritation that the sound of voices doesn't penetrate until he's in full view of the cabin, where Vera, Cas, and a tall blonde kid he vaguely recognizes from the watch seem to be just on the verge of yelling at each other.  Well, Vera looks hostile, anyway, while the kid has the sense to look kind of scared of her.  Cas, on the other hand, is sitting on the steps looking like sobriety just isn't worth this shit.
To his surprise, Dean opens his mouth to answer and hears instead a choked laugh emerge.  "Jesus, Cas."
Dean freezes.
Dean's concept of 'weird' is both wide in range and narrow in scope; it's all in the inflection, and Castiel's still learning how to interpret it.  "Dean--"
He lets the silence stretch until she looks ready to talk again.  "And then Micah showed up." She nods.  "How'd he find you?"
"Hey," he says blankly, then looks away, glancing down at the journal as if he's surprised by it before lowering it to his lap, finger marking the page.  "You're home." He shuts his eyes briefly, looking pained, before continuing. "So, uh.  Have a good time?"
Fighting down alarm--they like Alison and trust her and everything--Dean nudges Cas as another not-ripple slides by him.  "Uh, what is Alison…doing right now?"
," Dean interrupts happily.  "Coup, remember?
"I don't understand."
"I see why Cardixa welcomes you now," Sempronia says drowsily as Sappho works down her calves.  "She was jealous, you understand; she's been with my mother almost all her life, as close as sisters."  Then, with an acidic edge he's never heard in Cornelia's voice, much less Sempronia's, "Far superior to her only sister of birth.  Cornelia Major was far too infatuated with her high position to notice someone as mundane as a little sister.  She was like their mother and cared for three things only: her rank, her husband, and her wardrobe, in that order."
"With Amanda and no fucking way," she answers, sounding stronger, and taking a deep breath, she sits up, leaning her head against the back of the chair.  "I'm fine, it was--"
you going to do when this is over?"
He files that away for later as he calculates the window for Croat: six to eight hours, whoever did this had to have a Plan B for failures in Plan A.
Dean's blank expression is apparently read as 'totally knows who that is but more information about something'.
Dean licks his lips.  "This isn't about Croat."
As if he were waiting for acknowledgement first, Castiel hears him click the safety.  "Stay where you are, Castiel."
"Since you are, that's an incredibly stupid question to ask," Cas answers, putting away the knife with jerky movements, like he can't quite control his hands. "Don't concern yourself with us; we aren't here for you."
"I understand it felt like decades," Castiel says and tries not to wince at the sharp dig of Dean's chin.  "Or so I heard."
"Yeah."  Amanda searches his face.  "Weird shit went down, they never figured out what happened--Cas, it's been years, you don't think.…"
"Nothing's private from Cas when it comes to the camp," Dean answers easily.  "Cas?"
"Curious."  Dean leans an elbow on the coffee table, far too interested for Castiel's peace of mind. "Dean never got you any pie?"
"She was put out, of course, but compensated by marrying men who would carry out her will.  Two of them were excellent choices indeed: Clodius and Curio were intelligent, ambitious, and knew her value as friend and partner as well as wife and lover.  She guided them to the pinnacles of their respective careers under the aegis of Gaius Julius Caesar, Consul, General, and Dictator of Rome."
It's an hour before midnight when he tentatively decides that the worst of it is over.  According to Alicia's notes and the laws of diminishing returns, it's either worked entirely out of his system or he has a fifteen second period coming up in an hour or so, and he thinks he can handle that in the cabin.
So Joe's optimistic.  "Think she's avoiding the Misborn?"
"Essentially, though it's actually a very unpleasant analyst named Stephen Walker who does that part," Cas corrects him.  "Joseph commented the man was extremely patronizing during their brief interaction."
"Vera!" Vera turns at the frantic edge in Njoya's voice, jogging back down the hall and going in the door.  Dean's hand on his arm stops him from following.
Standing up, he looks down at the bent head, the defeated bow of his shoulders, and without thinking, strokes an errant strand of dark hair.  "Look at me," he says quietly, and slowly, reluctantly, Dean looks up.  "You're not a monster."
Dean's not so sure about that.  He remembers Sarah restraining Kat after Andy's death; unlike Drew, she wasn't fucking around keeping Kat down, and she wouldn't have hesitated to knock Kat out if she did anything she didn't like.  If Sarah had been the one to go downstairs to talk to Cathy, there's no way Kyle could have gotten her from behind.  He watched Sarah from Ichabod's walls, and a woman who could sneak up on a Hellhound and beat it almost to death after working out its position from at least twenty feet away using Cas and fucking
"That would be it," Alicia says.  "Haruhi heard shots fired, put the kitchen in lockdown--she knows procedure when people with guns go crazy in large groups--and ran out
Dean says, "Bullshit."
Cas tilts his head, and before his eyes, Cas sloughs off all the human trappings between one moment and the next.  An infinite ocean of drowning blue, a sky of stars and galaxies that goes on forever:   "We were the Host.  We had the right of immediate execution for any trespass against my Father's will both in Heaven and on Earth.  By our judgement, his actions merit execution."
"Cutting my wrists in a heroin bathtub?" Alison interrupts sweetly.
"You're gonna bleed out if we don't get this over with," Dean mutters, letting him go, which is almost immediately followed by the sound of something ripping.  "Cas, what can he do with your blood?  Anything?"
The collection of the Croat bodies at this time is impossible--there's no way to be certain when the three remaining Hellhounds will return--but Castiel tours the field himself, marking each face, reconstructing features sometimes only crushed bone and livid flesh, and committing them to memory before putting a final bullet in their heads.  Still running on far more adrenaline than he needs, he sets three teams to watch and assists Callisto and her helpers to finish the gruesome task of sorting and bagging the remains.
.  Fixing it into place in his mind, he takes in the whole and the individual parts for any flaw.
"When she saw--" Cas starts.
"Chuck wanted me to approve the first one," Cas admits, wrinkling his nose as he takes a sip from his own cup. "I skimmed it, but I really wasn't interested in the details.  Why?"
Alison's jaw tightens mutinously.  "Cas--"
"Let me go," Cathy says as she tries to pull free. "That's Del, Manuel!"
It seems like days but is probably only a few minutes before Anyi comes out.  "Cathy's infected."
"I'm okay with who you are now.  At that, you're the best there is."
Cas left something out when he told Dean about this, but it probably didn't even occur to him.  "You didn't know it was supposed to be hard."
"Living on this plane helps," he admits reluctantly.  "It seemed so ridiculously obvious that it never occurred to me that it wouldn't work.  It wasn't until after it did that I wondered how I'd thought of it at all."
"Don't have to be brave to pick up a gun and join a mob," Dean answers flatly, rolling them each one last breakfast taco from the remains on the plate and nudging one toward Cas, who picks it up immediately.  "Okay, let's do this a different way: was Heath?"
It's much closer than it should be, he finally decides uncertainly.  And seems to be closer still, with every moment that passes.
Dropping his hand, he crosses his arms, waiting for Cas to notice him, and then realizes how doomed to failure that plan is just on concept. "Okay, Cas?  What the hell are we doing?"
"Then we gotta get out of here," Dean starts, trailing off in belated realization of how ridiculous that is.
"Ah, got you." Crowley takes a sip of his wine, smacking his lips obnoxiously. "Well, no worries there; no time for fun, they're on the clock.  It took weeks to build the first one, and all they have is the time before the barrier collapses entirely to raise the power.  When the old one finally breaks, they use the backlash to hold it up, but that won't last long; they have to power it by the next dawn or it's gone for good."
Oh thank God.  "Good, so--"
"Thanks," he says.  "But I got this one, okay?  Just give me time and I'll think of something.  I'll wear her down, no problem."
She looks up, an odd expression crosses her face.  "That."  Capping the pen, she slides it behind her ear, focusing on something over his shoulder.  "You know Darryl was a dick to everyone except the team leaders, right?"
"They're from Laredo," Dean tells her, wondering how to put this.  "Not a lot of people can afford to carry down there, let's put it that way."
"Those nightmares I was having before we came to Ichabod, to start.  Where I'd get to the cabin right after the team leaders killed you and Vera, before I could stop them."
. Illustrative example, do not try this at home: on Sarah is set a geas to dance in the street until her feet hurt to Sarah alone."
thinking: Bobby, Castiel, the reservoir, everything that went so fucking wrong he doesn't even know where it started, and Jesus, that's the worst part, knowing that.  He should have noticed, should have seen it coming, when he could have stopped it, when Castiel would have
"They aren't speaking any longer other than professionally," he hears himself say.  "Nate and Zack. Not since Zack moved out."
"Look, it's about her going after Erica," Kyle says urgently.  "Cas, no matter what Dean says, you can't let her do it!"
"Yeah, but you didn't choose one of them. You chose this one."
"According to Vera, very much so."  Cas searches his face hopefully, and Dean's chest inexplicably tightens at the realization that this actually
"Dean needed something," Vera objects.  "I had a sense."
"And finally wake up," Teresa whispers, eyes dark with remembered fear. "I'd die for her; living for her was a bonus."
"Because I fail at being Dean Winchester," Dean tells him moodily, sprawled against the relocated pillows.  "That's why they're doing it again."
"My feelings won't get hurt, promise," she says with a terrible attempt at casual.  "Was there anything specific she said?"
"Shut up," Dean says, and briefly acknowledges the miracle of Cas actually doing it before adding, "No."
on the Texas-Mexico border, where the supernatural could do whatever the fuck it wanted because for reasons Dean can guess, most hunters seemed weirdly oblivious to reports that came from places where the people lived shit lives without running water and didn't do so great with English.  If a few dozen people died crossing the border in circumstances weird, no one really seemed to notice or even pretend to care.  Necessity makes a kick-ass teacher when it comes to language skills when you're the only person who can help and your first job is to convince them you're not a gun-happy rancher or Sheriff Arpaio's hunter equivalent.
Nate's head snaps up, looking so surprised Dean would be insulted if he could forget the first half of that convo with Cas a few minutes ago.  "Uh."  Nate squints at him.  "I appreciate it?"
"Cas--"
"I’m thinking her name right now," Dean says, an edge in his voice.  "But I can't say it--"
"I fucked up," she says flatly.  "They were calm, so I just ordered them watched and keep trying to get them to talk.  There was an emergency near the shift change, everyone got distracted, and somehow, Remington got left alone.  Maybe five minutes, but any amount of time would have been too long; he stripped the bed, knotted the sheets, got them looped around both legs of the bed, and one of my orderlies arrived just in time to see him make a running dive out the window.  That gave him enough momentum to break his neck."
Uh, no. The lying down thing is really working for him, thanks.
"Blackmailed into agreeing to stand in for him."
"She doesn't like Rome," she corrects him as Sappho assists Sempronia to her feet.  "And no fault in her, for how they treated her was a disgrace."
"Even when you're stupid beyond words--"
Alison's expression says she isn't going to pretend to be interested much longer.
"No," she answers, shaking her head.  "I get secrets, Dean.  It's not that: the opposite, actually."
"I'm not speaking in metaphor, I mean literally."  Opening his eyes, he sighs.  "I've never slept with anyone in the sense of sharing a bed or given discrete space with someone for the purposes of an extended period of unconsciousness, is that clear enough?"
"What's he doing?" Castiel hears Hans ask as he starts up the ladder, aware of the confusion of those on the ground and the gaze of those on the walkway as he ascends.
“Cas… You’re my home too.” He was about to cry, then tightened his grip on Cas and carried him all the way to the Impala. While kissing him and never letting him go.
Cas looked down at him, “Y- You knew I was close?”
“Dean..” Cas said his face was lit up as he looked at the field in awe.
He and Benny walked out the kitchen door heading towards the dorm room as they continued to pull each other’s leg about their significant others.
“Sure Dean.” Cas then wraps his arms around Dean, then a flash happens. The song on the radio ends and a new one started playing.
And as I sleep on the other side of the country
Cas was walking through the living room as he placed his bag down on their dining room table alongside his laptop. He had a great day with his high school kiddos. Most teachers say they couldn’t handle teaching high school English, but Cas loved it. He lived for the interesting discussions he and the kids got into.
He slipped on a white button up and put on a bolo tie as he slipped on a black blazer. His suit was by no means cheap looking, he kept this one a secret for a while now. Which was hard to do when Cas does their laundry and wears his clothes, but he’s not complaining. He likes to surprise Cas, the way his face lights up and the way his blue eyes stare at him longing. Which Sam labeled as “eye sex.”
Cas continued thrusting into him non stop like he was a god damn piston working into him over and over. He couldn’t help but mumble Cas’s name incoherently as he couldn’t think straight anymore. He started to feel Cas’s head fall forward into his sweaty neck. He started tangling his hands into Cas's hair as he got closer and closer to the deep end which he so was desperately craving.
“Fine, there is a possibility I do listen to the occasional Taylor song,” He said as a small smile crept up on his face, “Alright fine! What about you, have any plans tonight?”
Dean let Cas lead him down towards the docks while he continued staring at him. He couldn’t keep his eyes off of Cas. The way Cas's smile sent a warm feeling throughout his body, the way his Egyptian blue eyes stared at him like he was the world, and the feelings he couldn't imagine his life without this blue-eyed man.
“No, I want you here,” Cas says deep growl as he placed his head on his shoulder.
“Cas…” Dean pulled him even closer as they swayed to the music. Dean leaned over to whisper in his ear. “Your so important to me, you’re my soul, my heart, and my light that guides me home. I’m sorry it took me so long to notice it.” Dean finally had a word for the way Cas made him feel. It was home, something he never felt in a person before.
Cas chuckled as he ran his fingers over his chest, “Dean Winchester wherever you are miles high, oceans deep, or in between. I’ll be there through the good times and bad times because you’re mine.”
Cas nodded his head, “Yes, mixed in with some of mine as well.”
“Okay…” Sam has a look on his face.
Another flash. Dean and Cas were inside of the impala, but this time they were much younger. Dean was resting his arm across the bench seat behind Cas. He smiling bright while he tried sneaking glances at Cas while driving. Cas was holding on to his pre-calc book and sneaking glances at Dean while adjusting his glasses. Dean immediately pulled into a lake and put the car in park. He reached over pulling Cas over by the waist and started kissing him all over his face. Cas started laughing and wrapping his arms around Dean’s neck. Cas asked Dean if this is the reason why he took the long route home. Dean chuckled and said yes, then started kissing and sucking on Cas skin inside of his blue shirt, while Cas back fell onto the bench seat and started reaching inside Dean’s flannel touching his back and running his hands through Dean’s sweaty hair, that was drenched from football practice. Cas was enjoying every minute of it and so was Dean. He was trying not to get Cas dirty, but boy was Cas very persuasive.
Another flash. Dean and Cas were inside of Cas’s truck. Dean was drunk and laughing making sexual jokes and whispering them in to Cas’s ear. Cas just smiled and took off his trench coat and put it on Dean. Cas then closed the door and went over to the driver seat. Cas then pulled his truck outs of the bar parking lot and asked Dean why he didn’t take a woman home tonight. Dean went dead silent and tried making up an excuse. Cas then pulled over the truck and looked Dean in the eyes. Dean immediately almost said because ‘I love you, that’s why I didn’t take anyone home to our apartment.’ He quickly shut his mouth and waiting to be sober before telling him. Cas decided to let him slide since he’s drunk and continued to drive them back to their apartment.
He can’t stop himself from looking at the clock with anticipation. Even though people say looking at the clock slows it down, he can’t stop himself. Especially when his body’s buzzing with anticipation. Right now, Cas should be pulling into their driveway after a long day teaching, walking through their doors carrying his bag and laptop.
A tiny moan echoed from the hall leading towards the bathroom,
“Good cause I can’t keep my eyes off of you all night,” He whispered as he tightens his hold on Cas pulling their body closer together.
And get chills with every accidental touch
“It’s when angel and human feel deeply for each other. The soul of a human and the angels grace fuse together and they’re able to see into different universes. It seems there a more where we end up together.” Cas looks up at Dean who is smiling down at him.
Cas smile then whispered breathily, “Don’t get me wrong I love you dressed up, but I want you out of that suit as soon as humanly possible.”
He loves and appreciates his husband. Especially when he catches Cas playing with barbies with Claire or building blocks with Jack. Cas is a dad whose very hands on when it comes to their kids. He’s chuckled as he remembered Cas and Claire fell asleep on the floor. He had to put Claire to bed then carry Cas to their bedroom. When didn’t at all mind, not at all.
Dean reopened his eyes as his green emeralds shimmered in the morning dew of the sunlight. He looked down at Cas who was staring up at him with his beautiful blue eyes. He started to laugh as he placed a kiss on top of Cas head then mumbled, “We stayed here until the sun came up?”
“I’m sure you’ll find a reason,” Cas said as he planted another kiss on his chest then started walking slowly towards the direction of their cabin as the golden morning light glimmered down on their wet naked sun-kissed skin.
“Do you think... I’m where you belong?” Cas asked a little scared as he looked up towards Dean with a worried expression.
Dean is quiet for a long time.  "Did you want him to stay?"
Alison's eyes narrow. "You're still worried, though."
Alison's eyes widen as beneath the table, Dean's hand suddenly closes around his wrist, conveying reassurance with a warm squeeze.  "That doesn't mean--"
"The only thing I ever wanted." The blue eyes meeting his.  "You."
you can't find them?" Dean shouts, ignoring Joe and Amanda jumping.
"I anticipated that."  Reaching into the desk, she takes out the metal-cased scroll, weighing it in her hand, then opening it and removing the paper within.
"Also, Jane saw something," Lee says, and Jane stiffens, expression conveying 'what, no, God' which Lee ignores.  "Figured you might want to know."
knew about him--"
Really.  "Five seconds?"
"She's my wife."
"Only thing that has since the Croats," she answers, voice flat. "Easy to get location when there's nothing else around."  She frowns as she studies the wide open space that was the scene of a lot of fighting two days ago.  "Okay, anyone but me wondering why we haven't been attacked by anything else?  We got, what, a day and a half before it breaks?"
Almost immediately, Vera's smile stiffens and she gets to her feet to face him.  With Dean on one side and Vera on the other, he suddenly feels surrounded, the space between them charged with claustrophobic portent.  So far, Vera and Dean's interaction has been sharply limited to patrol meetings, and professionalism and unfamiliarity can cover many things that direct conversation can't.
"Oh no you don't," she snarls, dropping to her knees and planting a palm in the middle of the gore on his chest.  "No, he's not you, not now and never again.  That's past; you carry it, no help for it, but you don't wear it as your skin.  It's not yours anymore; it's too small now, it doesn't
"What did he do to the pipes?" Blessing them is a very good idea, but it would only work until all the water in those pipes was consumed, which in the infirmary would be very quickly.
"There's cake?" Amanda says in interest, peering around as if expecting it to materialize on request.  "Where'd you hear that?"
Cas stiffens.  "Dean--"
"If it is, this version of it is being shared now by someone who hasn't been catalyzed," he answers, and Dolores sucks in a breath.  "Micah is currently exhibiting similar behavior, albeit it seems only to manifest in distraction."  Which might mean that this version has five victims, and one of them independent of those at Volunteer Services that day.
"I know."  Castiel hesitates, licking his lips, and seeing Dean's eyes follow the motion helps not at all and a great deal.  Reaching back, he pushes Dean's right knee down, rolling onto his side and bringing Dean with him, kissing him quiet at the burgeoning protest and keeps doing it as Dean relaxes again, one leg loosely draped over his hip, comfortable and confirmation both.
She looks up at him in surprise. "How?"
"You're fine now ," Alistair assures her, looking down at Castiel fondly.  "I only put you together, though; that was the easy part.  Cas was the one who figured it out and who had to make sure you'd stay that way."
"Vera thought so," Chuck confirms.  "The rest of the camp….two I'm sure of, they died during the last mission before Kansas City, three I wondered about, the last one was killed when we went for the Colt.  Three or four that left were maybes, but I wouldn't bet against them."
"From when you were an angel?" He nods distractedly. "Hold on, I think--yeah."
"You realize his Brothers are going to discover where he is very soon?" The price on Castiel's head assures that.
“Dean..” Cas needily moans as his blue eyes stare down at him wantingly.
Cas then smiled as he placed his arm around his waist then planted a kiss on the side of his head, “You wanted to do it before breakfast.”
“Our friendship?” Cas still is oblivious to the subject, but still, many things still go over his head theses days.
Right at that moment, he heard the door shut for the bathroom.
Dean wrapped his arms around Cas again longing for his warmth. His body was getting warm, but he wasn’t going to tell Cas just yet. He leaned back to stare into Cas’s beautiful eyes which had a certain glow against the water and the sky. He went speechless for a moment then whispered, “You’re just so damn beautiful. How did I get so lucky?”
They stood there holding on to each other in like the other was going to disappear if one let go.
He lifted an eyebrow as a cheesy grin pulling at his face, “You finally pulled together a decent surprise for your guy?”
“What about our friendship did you want to talk about?” Cas looked at him again, it made Dean feel butterflies deep inside.
Which caused Dean to dig his fingernails into the woods and Cas’s hair. He nodded slowly with his head as he continued rocking his body against Cas.
“Dean… You’re my first love and I can’t ever remember a time I didn’t love you especially as much as I do now,” Cas wiped away as small tear as he wrapped his arms around him.
“What did you want to talk about Dean?” Cas looked at the sunset, then at Dean.
“Yes, now let's go have some breakfast before our family arrives.”
Dean wrapped his arms around Cas, “Who cares, that’s probably why he asked for the keys to the impala.” Dean said as a small smile appeared on his face gently planted a kiss on Cas forehead.
“To talk about us? Did I do something wrong?” Cas had a look on his face, the one he made when Dean made the mistake of blowing up at him.
Flash. Dean had just attended his first dance put together for Alphas searching for an Omega. It’s Deans first year, he met a breathtaking Omega who smelled of honey and summer breeze. Dean fell instantly in love and wanted to know this Omega more. Cas while on his fifth year of going to the dance watched Omegas get snatch up left and right, most Alphas wanted someone who was small famed and did what they were told, which was not at all Cas. Dean on the other hand wanted someone who stands up to him and call him on his bull. Years later Dean and Cas were in a full relationship and married. They were even planning on having a couple of pups in the near future. Dean has no intention of letting go of him. Cas well, he didn't want to let go of Dean either, he love Dean. Cas was different, but Dean didn’t care that’s the part he fell in love with the most. Dean’s Alpha and Cas’s Omega begged you be close and longed for each other when they were apart. They were sitting on the porch bench looking out at the stairs on the lake holding on to each other. Dean loved Cas and melts every time there close. They were each other’s soul and home.
“I love you too Dean. Ever since I left Heaven, it felt like I didn’t have a home, but now I know my home was never Heaven. My home is with you.” Cas’s eyes started turning glossy as he looked up at Dean.
“The car looks amazing Dean,” Cas said as he took a look towards him.
“Hello, Sam!” Jack waved at Sam.
Dean lifted Cas’s chin. “You’re all that I want all and all I’ll ever need... You, Sam, and the kid are it for me man.”
“This is the place I proposed to you, ran away with you, and gave you every bit of me,” He said as he took a glance towards Cas as he could see his eyes starting to get glossy.
“I don’t have no second thoughts, no regrets, and no turning back the clock for me... I’m all in baby,” Dean said as he took Cas in his arms holding him close.
“Is it that noticeable?” He chuckles lightly as he rubs the back of his neck.
“Uhh... No time let's go,” Sam said as he grabbing Jack's arm.
Cas looked up at Dean with genuine eyes. He knew Dean meant every word he said with every ounce in his body then said, “You know I can’t just show you images?”
Cas started to laugh as he leaned his head into Dean's shoulder, “You said that last time, but you’re too impatient to wait.”
“I thought you never ask,” Cas leaned in and placed a kiss on his neck.
Soon he found himself older and holding a bouquet of roses standing at their front door. He would have used his key, but he wanted to see Cas open the door like all those years ago. He knocked a couple of times then heard their door open.
“It’s just.. I feel so happy, I love you Dean” Cas smiled up at Dean.
Dean smiles.
“I want to fuck you,” Cas whispers into his ear as he lays soft kisses on his neck.
“I love you forever and always angel.” The both shared a kiss under the moonlight. Dean instantly grabbed Cas bridal style and carried him into the house.
He noticed Cas blushing slightly, “So what do you have planned?” Cas said as he grabbed his phone and closed their door.
Cas ran his hands up Dean’s arms then brushed his hair back slowly then asked in a curious tone, “Are you, serious Dean? I mean-“
Dean sat up slightly as he ran his fingers along Cas's arm then said, “I promise I won’t laugh, no matter how crazy it might sound.”
Cas started smiling as he walked towards him pushing back his dark hair. Cas quickly wrapped his arms around Dean then said, “Yes, but I like it.”
“Baby, I’m about t-“ Dean was able to mumble as he fell off the deep end to which Cas slammed back into trying to root himself deep inside of Dean, which caused him to moan Cas’s name loudly. They stayed together slowly rocking against each other, eyes closed riding the wave of emotion from their god-like orgasm together.
Cas retrieves the lube as he slicked up his cock more and moved to position himself to the entrance of his hole. Taking a moment to stare at him as he placed another kiss on his lips as he lifts his legs letting Cas run his finger between his cheeks and across his hole as a low moan erupted out of him, he almost wanted to beg Cas. He wanted him badly and almost needed him as badly as the air he breathes.
Dean pulled the impala into a field then shut off its engine as Cas sat upright in his seat. Dean opened the backdoor and pulled out a blanket as he quickly emerged by Cas's door. Cas got out of the car and walked beside Dean where he laid the blanket down. Cas took a seat as Dean dropped down next to him then slowly placed his arm around Cas pulling him towards him as the laid flat looking up at the endless stars.
“I can show you my memories as well as yours, but I get it if you don’t want me invading your privacy and-"
Flash. Dean and Cas were sitting on a porch cuddled up to each other. Dean was telling Cas that the British Men of Letters did a good job at getting rid of all the monsters in America. Cas was fully human and reaching up to Dean’s to cup face and started caressing it slowly. Dean was a retired hunter, Cas was an ex angel, and Sam is currently retired in a relationship with Elieen Leahy. Cas looked into Dean’s eyes.
Dean had a growing smile on his face as he leaned his whole body against the wood as he nodded his head, “That sounds good, but I think I’m going to need help getting there.”
He chuckled as he pulled Cas closer, “You know I never told you this, but everytime I’m next to you I feel complete.”
“Hey, can I talk with you Cas?” There’s a hint of nervousness in his own voice.
