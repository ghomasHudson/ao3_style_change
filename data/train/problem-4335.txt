Cas had been cautious around Dean afterwards, apologetic and unsure until Dean had assured him that it wasn't a big deal.
"What's the point, huh? Do you want to wage another war?" Dean asked, gritting his teeth. Asmodeus studied Dean.
"Well, you're the exception to the rule, Cas," she told him with an appreciative nod. "If only dad could be like you."
"Witch's robes mostly," Castiel replied simply. "People had to know who and what I was right away, as was the wish of the court I served."
"Castiel is on the list. He came to Raurica 15 years, so he's one of the earliest on my list. However, he is also one of the few that has a documented life before the move. It's actually pretty well documented the mid 80s, when his mother was murdered. Then a woman named Naomi Hawking became his legal guardian. It said in the records that she was Anna Novak's sister…"
He knew he should probably talk to someone about it, Cas for example, but Cas had enough on his own plate, what with how Jack's move to college had rattled him. So he let it be, said he was fine and got Cas to talk about Jack instead. He wasn't sure how long Cas would allow the distraction but so far Cas had enough thoughts about Jack that needed out that he didn't yet push. Maybe he was gearing himself up to a loving lecture for the weekend, but Dean unfortunately wouldn't get to find out about it.
"Cas, I think you just had the misfortune of a shitty dick as a husband," Dean told him, when he was rubbing a towel over Cas' hair after their shower back at the hotel. "There are plenty of people who use the designation card to explain away bad habits."
"The coffee is not sucky," he replied tersely. He was spared from saying more by Naomi focusing her eyes on Gabriel.
"Yeah? Alright, then I guess I have nothing to say to you at all!" Dean shouted, then he turned around and left, slamming the doors for good measure. He ignored them calling his name, he ignored anyone he passed. Fuck them all!
"As you wish," Uriel said though he did roll his eyes. He turned towards the knight, who was hovering close by. "You heard the commander. This battle is over, if you don't want to die right here, you better retreat!" he barked and the man straightened up.
"It's still hard for me to grasp the scope of your longevity or your history. Hell, I don't even understand why you left your homes to make space for humans," Dean said once they took a break to eat something.
"And there was chaos. Suddenly we had clashed with angels, we had lost our crown prince, and on top of that we could no longer rely on the centuries long alliance between Winchester and the Houses of Kendrick," John said. "If it did accomplish one thing, it was exposing the short-comings of Winchester. We couldn't even get a simple message through to our territories, we couldn't get answers from allies. It was a difficult time and we surely wouldn't have been ready for a demonic invasion."
As it turned out Jack and Claire had a whole lot of ideas about what a married man in his 40s was supposed to wear on a relaxing vacation to the beach. Castiel was sitting on the little sofa in the corner, getting increasingly more disgruntled and embarrassed, as the two went through the store. Castiel could have been in and out of the first department store he saw with another unassuming pair of shorts and maybe a sun hat, but no. For some reason Claire had decided that this would be a good moment to remember that he was a "beautiful, strong omega" and that he deserved to have some sexy lingerie. Jack's initial confused question if the lingerie store wasn't just for women, was met with Claire's firm assurance that everyone could wear lingerie, even an alpha boy like Jack!
Some angel had the foresight to put a chair in front of Cas' chamber, so that Benny didn’t have to stand around for too long.
After a while he reached out to pull another parchment from the drawer and put his fountain pen to it.
"Assimilation to human culture is far more recent than four hundred years ago," Castiel argued. "And Alphas today still don't get involved. Whether they live in caves or among humans."
"As I'm not initiated into the coven, I wasn't told anything. But the destruction of Sander's orchard was part of a dispute between Sanders and the witches who had dealings with him," he answered, not sure how this even mattered at this point. Sam didn't say anything, he merely studied him.
Dean had to attend a two-day training event at his new job, which left Cas all alone in the new house. It was somewhat odd to be alone, different than it had been back in his sad little apartment or in Dean’s luxurious place. But he had work to distract himself with and after he wrapped it up for the day, he read through the internet page for the Moondoor campaign, which seemed a lot more complicated and detailed than Cas had previously thought. Dean had given Cas Charlie’s number and they had texted a bit about the game, giving him some ideas about his potential character, though Cas felt he wasn’t creative enough to make a good character. Charlie’s answer to that had been:
Dean got up from the floor. Castiel didn’t comment it, not even when Dean walked over to him. It was odd touching him, digging his hands into Castiel’s shirt collar, almost brushing his skin with his knuckles. He was hot and humming with power. But still he let himself be pulled to his feet.
“I hope you’re open,” the stranger said and Castiel's magic instinctively reached out to get a feel of what kind of person this man was. His magic gently glided over him, feeling the shape of him, brushing just along the surface. He was kind and generous, a bit too hard on himself but full of potential. That was what Castiel could read best. Potential. It ran through this man like rich veins of gold.
"You don't have to flirt with others," Jack said, "or have sex." Cas definitely wouldn't be having sex, but he was sort of uncomfortable with the fact that his son was so casual about it. He had always been very open with Jack about sexuality, designation and gender, not wanting him to grow up feeling weird about his body or sex. But that was about Jack, not himself! "But this is a vacation for you, so you can feel good. I think you should buy something that
"Castiel here is single by the way and about as straight as a slinky," Gabriel announced to Castiel's great mortification. But at least Gabriel knew how to distract from the fact that he was trying to get as much information out of the hunter as possible. His obnoxious, embarrassing but generally harmless act was probably enough to tease answers out of people almost against their will.
"I don't know, Benny. I can't just ignore the circumstances and approach Cas like any other dude who saved me from death."
"You're the witch of the realm and I am your future queen! If I order you to heal both, you cannot refuse!" Castiel didn't move from his position, unafraid of the danger and his loyalty untouched by the show of disrespect.
By the way, some of you wondered if Cas might be pregnant, based on Millie's comments! He's not, because I don't really think surprise pregnancy would fit Dean and Cas in this story. Dean and Cas will eventually talk about where they stand on the topic of having children together. This will involve talk about pregnancy. I haven't updaten my tags in a while. Should I add a tag for discussion of Mpreg?
"Morning," he grumbled and headed straight to the coffee, taking a sip before he was ready to load his plate. "I got it," he said when Castiel made a move to get up from his chair. He remained seated, watching Dean prepare him a plate as well, then carrying it over to their table.
"Nope. There it is," Dean said and studied the dildo. It was made out of wood, painted in white with evenly drawn markings in a faded pink. It was very detailed and very big. Dean pulled out his phone and opened the conversation with Cas.
"You do know that omegas are perfectly capable of pleasuring other omegas. And they can get them through a heat comfortably," Meg told him and Cas' face heated up. "It's not rocket science, Clarence. If you don't want to use your dick there's plenty of toy options. All good sex needs communication and exploration of boundaries. Don't believe all that porn tells you."
"You know what? I'll have Charlie do some of her hacking. Maybe financial records will reveal something. Just wrap it up and move on if she finds nothing," Sam suggested. Apparently, Dean hesitated for too long with his answers. "
"Oh, uh. No. Not at all," Dean said, "I like kids but… it's complicated." Dean knew this was a very bland answer, one that barely scrapped at the surface of the issues. Dean was no stranger to the idea of having a child with someone he didn't love, he was the crown prince after all and before this all happened, he had expected to select his partner based on political considerations. The line of succession, even in a modern kingdom such as Winchester, was still something they had to curate carefully. Having children with an angel, while he technically was a temporary political prisoner, was just not feasible. Besides, no matter what Cas said, he was still a dude. Dean had seen his dick, had made sure to stimulate his prostate, had seen him come heavily over his own stomach… Dean shifted in his seat, his line of thinking leading him down a much more interesting path far too quickly. But the fact remained that Dean couldn't quite wrap his mind around that at all and he was glad that he didn't have to. Not quite as glad as knowing that Gabriel implying that he'd somehow magically be forced to have Cas' babies was just Gabriel harassing him, but still glad. With that settled, his mind was free to take notice of his somewhat interested dick.
"Honor-bound, yes," he interrupted, "I get it." Lady Bevell studied him intensely. Dean frowned at her when her stare became slightly unnerving.
"Come here, sweetheart," he said with a smile and Cas went with a sigh of relief, letting himself be wrapped up in Dean, gladly accepting that Dean was willing to carry his weight and let him forget what was going on outside of Rapunzel tower and all the questions the world held, just for a little while longer.
"I'm your handmaiden! Let me fill your plate!" Charlie announced after that and grabbed Dean's plate before he could say anything in protest. She studied all the food on the table, shrugged and served Dean big helpings of everything. "And dig in! Whatever it is."
Castiel felt no remorse leaving behind the old and cold cottage in the pine forest and to move into a nice home in the village when their daughter was born.
“My dad made it. When I told him that you were probably shivering down here without heat – and I was right – he made us a pie.”
"I lied earlier… I actually don't have to work this weekend," Dean admitted tiredly. "I just said that because I didn't want to disappoint you… Because I'm just so tired, Cas… I'm so sorry, I just can't make the drive today…"
"Wait, what?" he managed to say, once he had righted himself again. Meg was already laughing at his confused look, while Dean went from concerned to amused as well.
And I'm back with a new chapter! It ended up being a bit long and even though I had a good place to stop the chapter (and make it a comfortable 5k), I felt I had to give you some more content and now it's long.
"Ah hell," he said, his voice coming out as a whine, when he sat down next to Cas, who was already looking out of the little window, even though there was nothing for him to see. Sam was in the row behind them, looking amused.
“Cas,” he started. “That’s just it. I’m ready for it to change.” Cas stared up at him, awed and unable to say anything. He took note of how slow Dean was when he leaned in closer, watching for Cas’ reaction but whatever he was looking for, he must have found it because he leaned in and then his lips covered Cas’. It was a soft touch and it almost sent Cas to his knees. Dean drew back and studied Cas. But then he grinned.
"Hi dad!" Jack called, loud enough to be heard even though Cas hadn’t switched on the speaker. "Has Dean already arrived?" Castiel sent Dean a look and Dean had to laugh.
“I don’t know what to tell you, Dean,” Cas admitted. “It seemed that the bomb that went off inside the Empty blew holes into it. The Empty is a space between worlds or… beyond worlds. It’s difficult to describe.”
"Cool. I'm really looking forwards to it," he said and ducked his head, but Cas could still make out his grin. He moved his leg and bumped his foot into Dean's as a gesture of fondness.
"I was raised by a single mom. She has always been and is still very proud to have had two omega sons. I have one brother, a twin actually. He's married and has a daughter a bit older than Jack. The family of Jack's father is full of alphas. Luke, that's Jack's father, was very proud when Jack presented, despite the fact that there are plenty of omegas and betas in my family," Cas explained.
"I'm so sorry," Dean managed to say, forcing the words past the pain that wanted to cut off his air.
"It's a modest bikini," Cas said, once he came back outside, forcing his voice to remain calm. He wasn't going to stoop to Luke's nasty level.
"Good stuff, Dean. Eyes on the prize," he declared, clapping his hands once and then getting up. He buttoned up his jacket and then motioned down at the file. "Have that signed contract on my desk by noon."
"What are you thinking of?" Dean wondered, when they were sitting on the balcony at night, enjoying some beers as they watched the sea in the distance.
If no new power would come to her, then either one of two things was true; the child got rejected by the magic and left to be eaten by whatever creature came upon him, or the gossip was true and witches should really find something else to invest in than first born children.
"Always. Mostly he just enjoys hearing himself talk. I hope he didn't bother you too much," Castiel explained with another sigh. Dean shrugged.
"You're a sap," Dean muttered. "But same…" Castiel chuckled and Dean felt some of the tension inside of him ease. "So… what now?"
Dean received word that Castiel asked to see him multiple times, but he was very keen on ignoring any demands Castiel would make on him. And that was going rather well until he walked into Uriel on the way to the gardens. He was startled to see him, having gotten used to the angels leaving him and his people alone. Clearly Uriel didn't have the same sense of boundaries Castiel did.
"Selfishly I'd like that, but I doubt you'd be able to rest easy if you knew that the wind was slowly turning against humans. You'd worry, like any future king would," Cas said and of course he was right. "But as you said… It's fucked up." Dean laughed at that.
"Uh-huh," was all Dean said, walking over to the drawers containing the catalogue. "I thought you had gone back to the capital?" He did remember Cas saying something about it during one of their breakfast meetings.
"What happened? They said you had to retreat because the information was wrong," Sam started but before Dean could answer, Sam continued: "I've heard talk however. That you were defeated, that you… that you were badly wounded."
"I know you've been lobbying for your little husband. What I want to know is if you will oppose me?" Lucifer wondered, addressing his question to Cas, ignoring Dean.
“What’s going on?” Cas asked into the night. What point was there to sending him back to Earth with an unpractical outfit? Surely… surely this wasn’t the current fashion? For a dreadful moment Cas feared that he had spent decades or even centuries in the Empty only to be released into a world that held nothing Cas cared about. Cas looked up into the sky, studying the stars and found that no… no, some time had passed but not more than a couple of months.
"I can't believe that you weren't wearing a wig," Dean countered with a laugh, feeling himself relax into the conversation. Ash swiped his hand through his long hair, proud of it like he always was.
"Uhm," Dean stammered, stalling so he could do some quick thinking. What could he reveal? He had already said too much to take it back now. Could he disturb this dimension just by letting Cas know about another dimension? Surely that wouldn't have any effect on Cas here. "I suppose if I learn the secrets of this universe, I might as well share some of mine," Dean finally said and Castiel looked eager to hear it. Dean bit back a laugh, but before he could tell him all he wanted to know, a warning bell went off in the back of Dean's head. What about the cosmic consequences? How far reaching was Billie's pact? What if he dragged this human guy into the whole mess too?
As it turned out, the god didn't even flinch when he was face to face with drawn guns. He did however narrow his eyes slightly at the angel blade that Castiel was holding by his side. Not threatening yet, but the warning was clear.
"Hey," the man said into the phone, "got room for one? Male omega." Cas curiously tilted his head at him. "Aha. Good. Thanks." The man turned back to the window, his expression bordering on kind, but the boredom hadn't lifted much. Castiel had the distinct feeling that what was such an extraordinary experience for himself, was just another evening for the alpha. Castiel wasn't quite human enough to be envious of being so comfortable with confusing human interactions, but he was close.
“My dad made those. They are supposed to keep demons and other entities out,” Jack said. “But not ghosts!”
"Excuse me?" Dean almost chocked on his beer, because that? That had been Cas' voice. Dean turned to the side and found an alpha with a moustache (a moustache! Were they in the 70s?) crowding against Cas.
"Hey, it wasn't my choice. I don't know why angels leave behind residue. But the Grace seems to be quite comfortable inside me."
"We're not in public, this is not court. I'm here as a father on the bedside of his son who almost died," he said and Dean felt so grateful he might have blinked his eyes a bit harder. But his father also looked away, blinking at the ceiling.
"It's great study material. The medical world will be talking about this for a while," she had told him and if at least one good thing would come of this incomplete soul bond then Cas could live with that.
"You're very welcome. We've been dying to meet you both ever since Dean told us about you," Mary assured them.
"Not God, obviously. You're one of the deities the people here worship," Castiel explained almost as if he was worried Dean would be offended or even hope for too much.
"We grab beers together, we watch movies together, we make breakfast for each other! Whenever you're not currently in the wind because of… stuff, we even live together," he argued. "Everyone knows we're mates!"
Castiel loved his niece, he really did. She knew what she wanted in life, she was unfailingly kind and she had no qualms about speaking her mind. Unfortunately, her charming and strong-willed way had the side-effect of making Castiel do things he knew he'd later regret.
"But there's more you want to say. You have an idea," Mary said and Dean nodded. "I want to hear your ideas, Prince Dean. Very officially."
"No. I dress myself," Castiel said slowly, sending a look over his shoulder at Dean, as if he was wondering why Dean wasn't able to dress himself without a servant's help. Thanks Charlie. Not that Dean cared what Castiel thought of him.
"Don't worry, babe. I've talked it through with my GP, it's all good. And you should be glad, because I'm eating broccoli now." Well, technically he was merely pushing it around the plate, trying to hype himself up to eat it, but Cas didn't have to know that. He heard Cas heave a big sigh over the phone and Dean had a feeling that he was gearing himself up for some sort of parental commentary. Dean quickly shifted gears. "The Seattle deal is already made, but I hope to network there and land us some other deals. I'm trying to push Sandover to lessen its ecological foot-print and use more partners who are focused on renewable energy. But it's expensive and the bosses are dinosaurs…"
"Thank you for speaking on my behalf today at the council," he said, then he got into the car "good-bye, Gabriel." Gabriel pushed his hands into the pockets of his jacket and grinned at him.
"I'll better go," he said and started to move to the side, aware that there was no way out but to squeeze past the angel. Castiel however lifted his hand, which made Dean step back instinctively, even though there was quite some distance between them still.
genuine. Just like Cas' were. The guy opened himself up to you because he thought he had to for the spell. And well… He's always been a bit of a fool… He should have noticed that the love spell wasn't there anymore because it's geared towards making you want to please the caster. Just a word and your mind would have been distracted from working the case. And you should have loved Castiel's crappy coffee and pie."
earlier in Lebanon. But it had been unpleasant so he would very much prefer to feel nothing. To be quiet like nothingness at the center of the galaxy, calmly watching stars swirl.
"I think we need to talk about kids," Cas explained. Dean widened his eyes, sitting up slowly to stare at him. Cas's forehead creased and he sat up too.
"So you just want me to sit here with my thumbs up my ass?" Dean asked, grabbing the letter out of Cas' hands. Cas sent him a puzzled look, his eyes dropping to Dean's hands. Dean rolled his eyes. "Dude, it's a figure of speech. Am I just supposed to sit here and do nothing?"
"What, speak up, dude," Dean said with a groan. When Chuck spoke again, Dean belatedly realized that he was speaking Latin. Dean wanted to punch something.
Why would a cursed dildo send him to some random countryside, Dean wondered as he started walking. Maybe this was a sexy fantasy? Dean looked around. Nope, not enough naked people for a sexy fantasy. Actually, no people at all.
"Actually, I've come here to talk to you about something," Dean said once Cas had eaten and the comfortable silence between them had calmed some of Dean's nerves.
"Uh, yeah. Sorry. I must have forgotten," Dean said. "Things kinda blur together sometimes," he muttered. That got Cas to turn away from the fridge and look at Dean. "Not a whole lot to do around here than snoop through your stuff…"
Castiel lowered his gaze back down to the little prince. He looked angelic in the early morning light, with his perfect wisp of golden hair, resting in the crook of Castiel's arm. Not touched in the least by the dirt on the witch's clothes or the gloomy darkness of the wild forest looming not too far away. Bobby waited with bated breath. He had seen blessings before, also done by Castiel. But witch blessings of future kings or queens were exceedingly rare nowadays.
"I'd like to meet everyone after I freshened up to update you on what's going on," Dean told Benny, when he helped Dean carry up his bags. Dean groaned when he dropped his stuff in his quarters and made a straight line to his bed, letting him fall down face first.
"It seems foolish to build the hope of your kingdom's prosperity on one boy and then send that same boy off to die in battle," Uriel retorted. While that blow definitely hit the target - Dean's involvement in war was a highly contested topic in their kingdom as well - John didn't let that deter him.
“I’m not 25 anymore and Dad no longer drinks. It won’ be too bad,” Dean vowed. “Once Jack is of age, he can join and keep an eye on me. We’ll make it a three generations thing.” Cas smiled at that and Dean felt very reluctant to leave without Cas. “You can join too. It’s not like it has to be an alpha party.”
The door opened with a loud squeak of the hinges and the entire classroom turned to look to the side. Castiel instantly narrowed his eyes. Dean Winchester was strolling into the room, a bright cheeky smile on his face, showing off his alpha fangs. The irritating thing about Dean Winchester was that he was handsome and he knew it. This kind of confidence in one's own scales shot sparks of jealousy through Cas. Cas wasn't exactly shy, but he just never really got along with people, dragons or otherwise. (That he was a male omega didn’t help matters. Humans found it freaky, dragons deemed it unfortunate.)
"Nuh-uh, I'll be going tomorrow. Hannah wants five of us here to…" she pushed up her glasses and tilted her head in Dean's directions, "do our jobs."
But when he got back to his empty apartment, he felt such an odd sense of wrongness, of not being where he was supposed to be, that he caved in and made himself a profile.
The only thing left to do now was to ask around the neighborhood, which was certainly going to be fun. An FBI agent going from door to door with a picture of a disappeared sex toy. Dean's phone vibrated and he pulled it out. Surprisingly, Cas had texted him back, but it was nothing but a rude emoji.
"Sam!" he shouted, frantically looking through the blaze. Sam wasn't here but before Cas could give up with a frustrated roar, he looked up and almost screamed in horror. Jess was stuck to the ceiling, gasping, tears streaming down her face and blood dripping from a wound on her stomach. Castiel lifted up his hands and Jess was released from the magic that held her up, dropping into Castiel's arms with a groan. She was fading fast, so Castiel sent a shock of energy through her, that knitted together the worst of her wounds, stopping her life from bleeding out, but it also knocked her out with a breathless gasp.
“Fuller. Michael and I certainly have our work cut out for us for the next couple of centuries,” she said, but before Cas could ask what that meant she continued: “you’ve changed.” Naomi was almost squinting now as she looked at him though she clearly was trying to remain calm and collected.
"So, Dean." Dean put on his best smile for his boss. Zachariah had that patronizing edge that older betas in charge of alphas often had. Zachariah considered Dean his little pet project of sorts and he wasn't above reaping the praise for how well Dean was doing under his tutelage. Dean didn't doubt his own skills, because he had worked damn hard for them, but he knew to be tolerant of Zachariah's whims. He was grateful for Zachariah taking a chance on an orphaned alpha on nothing but his intuition that Dean had potential. From the time Dean was 17 up until now, his life had been basically sponsored by Sandover, so they were right to expect not only loyalty but also dedication from Dean.
"Hmph, fine," Jack finally agreed. Cas sighed, but then Mary decided that dinner was ready and they were all ushered to the table.
"What's wrong?" Castiel asked and Dean reached behind himself to pull his gun out of his waistband and checked the bullets.
"When the doll turned into a woman, you all had sex with her," Castiel continued and Drought actually blushed, but he did grimace. Castiel leant over to Dean. "A lot of stories about the Sennentuntschi are at its core about transgressive desire. I had assumed that some of it had been added under the ideas of Christian morality, but apparently the silence of shame around an encounter with the Sennentuntschi is definitely real."
"Oh come on. You're having a crisis because you're lusting after another omega. Is that the only issue you have in your life?"
"We have already confirmed what we could. When we informed Davies and Lady Bevell, they renewed their efforts. Ketch has been found on the old continent, clearly trying to get everyone off his trail, and he's been brought to Kendrick to be interrogated," John told him, his expression darkening. "We have the reports."
"What? Good night? We were having a talk about babies and you just say good night?" Dean asked, wrapping his arms around Cas to pull him close. Cas started laughing once Dean kissed him all over his face. "This is a highly emotional moment for me!"
"Thank you," Castiel said, then he lifted his hand to wave. Charlie waved at him too and Dean said his good-byes as well. Then they were through the gate. Castiel decided on a leisurely pace, which enabled Dean to look around and gather his thoughts.
taken some pics of them in bed, but no, he would keep those to himself. He knew exactly what he wanted to send. They had taken a typical beach selfie, with the sunset behind them, smiling at the camera with Cas resting his chin on Dean's shoulder, his smile wide and gummy. He was wearing his sunglasses on the top of his head and a t-shirt that sadly hid his gorgeous swimsuit. But it was still adorable. And he looked great too, as happy as he had felt in that moment. He sent it to Cas for approval and did get a thumbs up emoji sent back.
"Listen to me, Sam. There is a world out there for you. You are meant for great things. I'm sorry I held you back all those years because I was afraid. But I'm not going anywhere now. Kids grow up and have to live their own lives," he said and Sam looked at him with wide, shining eyes. "It'd be nice though if you came to visit sometimes? I know it's a long journey from the harbor but-" Sam was out of his chair and had wrapped Cas in a fierce hug before Cas could even finish his sentence. Castiel sighed in relief, hugging Sam close, even though he was now far too big to practically sit on his lap like that.
"I disagree," Castiel told him and even though Lucifer's words did hurt some part of him, the anger at his husband trying to humiliate him still far outweighed the hurt. "Claire and Jack both liked it and I do too. You're not going to the beach with me, so you don't have to look at it." At this Luke's face changed to a sneer.
("Should enroll the kid into college. Give him something else to do than steal you away," Dean had grumbled once they had been reunited after the three-week hunting excursion.)
"So it wasn't Sam," he said, suddenly turning around, causing Castiel to stop. "I mean… Man, I don't get what's going on. Is this dude trying to kill Sam or did he abduct him? What's his angle here? And what's with the fire?"
"What?" Dean asked, totally taken by surprise. Cas sent him a look. "Sorry, it's just that I didn't know you were talking to them. They never mentioned it."
"Bottle's warm, that's good," she said, then she fed Jack who was quick to forget his grumbling. "Just like this. Ah, he's actually cute."
"Dude's a dick. He shouldn't talk to you like that," Dean said softly but Cas merely shrugged, not interested in discussing it. "Hey. Do you want to come to my room?" Dean offered, concern written plainly over his face even though Castiel had expected a flirty expression.
Growing up, Castiel had never really put a lot of stock into the fact that he was an omega. Omega discrimination had been something that didn't happen to him. Of course, the fact that he was what Gabriel called a "pitiful hermit" also might have added to that. He rarely left the house unless it was for work, so the chances to get harassed for being an omega were slim. Not that he made a point of letting people know that he was an omega. In his opinion it was nobody's business and in Illinois it wasn't required by law to state your status when you applied for a job. Only once Naomi had suggested him for a position in Sandover HQ and had been refused based on his status, Castiel thought to even mention it.
"It is a bit funny," Jimmy insisted. "Come on, Cas. It's not like Jack is far away. Illinois State is a short car drive away from home. And even though Luke's disgruntled that he didn't want to go to Michigan State like him, Jack is his precious alpha son. He'll make sure to grease the right palms to keep Jack out of trouble," Jimmy told him. Technically Cas knew all of this, but it was still unsettling to him not to see Jack all of the time. That he had only been able to call Jack back out of his gaming induced absence by tempting him with Dean's weekend visit had been bad enough. Jimmy studied him, leaning back in his chair with a somewhat smug expression. "You're no longer married to Luke, Cas. I don't think you would have greatly enjoyed yourself if you were, but with Dean in the picture maybe you'll swiftly learn that there are benefits to no longer having to parent 24/7." Cas wrinkled his nose. "Amelia and I are definitely enjoying ourselves."
Jack looked like he wanted to hear more about sex and other things the adults in his life did while in bed, but that definitely wasn’t what Dean needed now and Sam looked like he was one wrong word away from bursting out in laughter at Dean's expense. And nobody needed that, least of all Dean.
"You really want to drive all the way to Wisconsin for this?" Dean asked, quickly feeling his dreams of spooning evaporate.
"Yes, Dean… Please… Put down your roots here," he begged. Dean closed his eyes, not putting up any resistance when Castiel pulled him into a hug, kissing his cheek. "Welcome home."
"You're not doing a good job then," he told her and Anna lifted an eyebrow. "They still raid human settlements!" Anna seemed amused by this reproach which was not what Dean had expected at all.
"I can just imagine Luke and Gabriel dragging Jack to a night club to 'let his alpha out' or whatever alpha initiation ritual they might come up with," he grumbled. Dean sat down on the bed too. "Jack's far more interested in Star Wars than in dating."
"Yes," Cas moaned and Dean would be lying if that didn't go straight to his dick with a sort of intensity that he hadn't expected.
"Cas… Nothing's gonna happen. Just… relax. Take a shower," he said, his voice sounding drawn. Castiel felt shame burn in his cheeks, so he turned around without another word, getting to the shower.
"Enochian is the current main language of angels, but there are other forms and regional variations. We generally understand each other, especially since we all came closer to each other 600 years ago. Many thousand years ago, we were further spread over the earth, but angels were connected in the host."
Jack was glad when Cas finally came back. The hum of the warding reacting to Cas was what alerted Jack to his presence and he looked at his bedroom door in anticipation. Usually, Cas said hello to Dean first, which was fine in normal circumstances, but right now Jack really had to see him.
The door fell back into its lock behind Dean with a loud slam. Nobody came running at the noise and Dean had the sinking feeling that he might be all alone. He decided to investigate. The church was made out of solid stones, with slim windows letting in rays of muted light, and there were old looking paintings on the walls, the paint more vibrant than Dean was used to from the pictures he had seen of similar paintings. Gold and silver items such as decorated chests and goblets stood in alcoves or on wooden tables. Despite the apparent missing modern luxuries like heating and electric light, the monastery probably had money.
“Does that mean you want to start trying?” he wondered and Cas couldn’t tell by his tone of voice if Dean was hoping for a yes or a no answer.
"Damnit, no!" Dean wheezed, but he didn't pull his hands out of Castiel's hold. Cas was unsure how to answer to that.
your brother. I was abandoned by my parents as a baby, because I had something evil in me! A threat to the kingdom that they wanted to lock up until they could send someone to kill me. Are you here to finish the job?!" Sam shouted with more energy than Cas would have suspected possible, given his current injured state.
"What about Cas though? Can you go back to the kingdom…?" he wondered and Dean's playful expression dropped.
"Actually, a pretty nice dude, absolutely not what I would have expected. Cute kid too," he said. Dean heaved a sigh, pinching the bridge of his nose.
"No people that want to murder me," Sam retorted and now it was Castiel's turn to huff. Sam smiled disarmingly. "How can anybody from the kingdom know that I'm the fabled demonic boy king? There's nothing demonic about me. No horns, no tail, no black eyes."
"I'm not just any run of the mill god, my friend," the god said with an amused huff. "I am a god of life, not one of selfish greed. I won't keep the life that has been sacrificed to me. When empowered by a sacrifice I am able to revive people. I can return Cas' life to him right away."
"We've actually had a breakthrough in that. Some houses of Kendrick have really been difficult the last couple of months, but we found someone who had good information. I invited her as well but I suppose she's not here yet," Bobby explained.
Whatever conspiracy theory Sam was cooking up in his head to explain Dean's extended stay in Raurica, Dean wasn't interested in believing it. But, and Dean admitted this to himself with great shame and even greater reluctance, he was concerned.
"I'm totally calling dibs on that one. I've already dealt with cursed pornography once, so why not also some cursed sex toys," Dean said with a grin.
He was pondering that, somewhere suspended between cool self-reflection and self-pity, when he felt a peculiar tingling at the back of his mind. Someone or something had crossed into the confines of his banishment. Something was stalking through the vegetables, rustling, the magic in the corn salad plants brushing past them, not resisting, merely curious.
"Authorities shocked about the unexplained death of a young woman in her home in Beverly," Dean started reading. "Anna Novak (25) was found dead in her house after an anonymous tip alerted the local police. When they arrived at the scene, they found the woman dead in the living room, her throat slit. They also discovered her six-year-old son in the house, alive. He had survived an attempt on his life with injuries, but none of them life threatening. Police are investigating, but say that there is no apparent connection to the other unresolved deaths which had occurred during in the last couple of weeks. They are treating it as a robbery gone wrong and are looking for suspects."
"Aw, you're cute. Bye, Cassie," Gabriel said with a wave, then he left. Castiel remained sitting for a while, reluctant to actually face what remained of the day.
"Dean, I'm serious. You know what witches can do." Dean wanted to argue, but now that they weren't talking he noticed that the shower had been switched off. He felt a sudden rush of panic.
Castiel was quick to make his way through the battle field towards where Dean Winchester fell, Uriel at his side, his expression passive. He had sent one flight ahead while he waited for Uriel to follow his call to join him in this battle as his second in command. Uriel was happy to join him and was as swift as Castiel had hoped. Still, they only made it to the battle after the humans were well on the way of a quick and bloody defeat even though the battle couldn't have lasted long yet.
Cas came to work on the next day with the remnants of a guilty conscience. He had been steadfast for the entire previous work day, not allowing his thoughts to stray to Mr. Winchester. When he had gotten home, however, into his small, empty apartment after he had been around the last stubborn wisps of Mr. Winchester's scent, he had caved. He had no face to go along with that scent, but his imagination had still run wild when he pleasured himself that evening. Admittedly, Cas didn't really know what to imagine when it came to having a fellow omega man as a lover. Cas had never been interested in a relationship with another omega and he had certainly not been interested in checking out pornography of the omega on omega kind as they tended to be mostly for an alpha viewership. He was ill prepared, even for something as simple as masturbation.
"Is it… customary to get down on my knees when giving you an answer?" Castiel asked, slowly bending his knees but Dean laughed, giving his hand a squeeze.
to do it." Castiel nodded, listening carefully. Jack had never actually talked in detail about his parents' divorce but Jack was usually like that, working through issues on his own or with Claire before he decided what he felt about it. And it was still pretty recent… "And with Dean… I understand that it's the best choice… You and Dean want to be together."
"Castiel here is good at following directions of recipes, but he doesn't have passion," Gabriel said with a grin. Cas guessed that this was at least nicer than what he had said at the meeting.
"I swear, if you ever send someone an unsolicited dick pic, I'll disinherit you," Claire grumbled, bringing up some lemonade and mango slices to the "matchmaker central" (Claire's bedroom). Jack seemed focused on his task, clicking and swiping.
"Odd, right? I thought so too! Surely, you wouldn't jeopardize Cassie's life and career like that?" he challenged, his tone still innocent but his expression had gone dark. Dean couldn't help feeling embarrassment pool uncomfortably in his stomach. He thought he felt something sting inside his chest, like shock or pain and since he instinctively knew that these weren't his own feelings, he finally dared to turn his head enough to see Cas. The guy was rigid in his chair, staring back at Dean, his face seemed washed out of color. Dean tore his eyes away and glared at Gabriel.
"I'm a missionary," Castiel said and Dean lifted his eyebrow at that. "I came here to convert people to Christianity."
"I… thank you," he said, speaking through his emotions. Sam gave him a quick hug, then he went inside, excited to wash properly. That left Cas and Dean looking at each other. Dean quirked an eyebrow, then he uncrossed his arms to hold them open.
He shouldn't be improving at the rate he did. Dean wondered if it was an effect of Castiel's Grace. Cas insisted that it wasn't harmful, Naomi had somewhat evasively confirmed that he wouldn't stop being human because of it. But surely there must be some sort of consequence for Dean too.
." That little speech left Dean just as surprised as it did Cas. He really hadn't meant to say any of that. He lowered his head, feeling his cheeks burn in shame.
"It's alarming," Castiel admitted. "That Winchester cannot get access to its allies seems highly suspicious and would suggest that your kingdom is being isolated."
"If Dean dies here that will draw the attention of his brother Sam. We have gotten intel that Sam is withdrawing gradually from hunting, but Dean's disappearance would bring him down on us if there was even just a hint of it being caused by supernatural means," he explained.
"No, I don't think he needs help. Doesn't stop me from fretting," he told him. It didn't feel good lying to Cas, but… but he couldn't have him know about the investigation yet. Just… in case.
"Yes. Everything's alright. The firecracker version of me transported us to the Bunker. We're alright. Well… I don't know about Cas."
"And how does that feel like? Do you constantly have voices in your head?" Dean asked. "Your kids screaming in your head that you can't forget the candy when you go to town?" Naomi's mouth twitched and it was probably the closest to a smile for the icy lady.
He whispered the words of the spell in practice so that he would only have to send the intent through his mind for his magic to do its work. Silently he let his mouth shape the words as he combined ingredients and imagined how he would have to open himself up, what it would be like to unchain all of Dean's rage and guilt and his ravenous need and to reshape them into desire that would narrow all of its raw power onto Cas. How it would feel to have it wash over him, plunge deep into Cas to stir the magic in him into a whirlwind of unleashed power.
"Apparently he's actually one of the four kings," he said, feeling somewhat gratified to see that Benny was as surprised by this turn of events as Dean had been. "Cas gave me shit that I haven't even figured that out in the months I've been here. Readily available information he called it." Benny seemed torn, eventually taking off his hat to scratch his head.
“Yes,” Cas said, smiling at Dean, “by Claire sending me a text message actually.” Dean’s eyes widened. “Not only am I awake but I’m actually alive. The Empty taking me didn’t kill me. I don’t know why. Maybe it was weakened greatly.”
Of course, a divorce was much more stressful than Cas would have wanted it to be, but he felt good about it, even if he was exhausted.
"No… No Cas," Dean started, shaking his head. He grabbed on to Castiel's shoulder, giving him a shake. "This is not your fault. Asmodeus set the fire, not you. You're helping. You're healing all you can," he told him. "Are you listening to me? You're doing the best you can!"
Dean could hear the door to the bar open, the noise spilling out into the night before the door swung shut again.
"Let's get out of here and worry about what has happened later, okay?" Dean asked, and Sam marveled at how quickly he was back in business after having just died. Maybe, he thought, that was just how noble princes were. Dean clapped Sam on the back, then he drew his blade and guided them all out of the cursed cabin, leaving behind the still smoldering ashes of Asmodeus.
"Yes, every family vacation, Cas brings out the sensible black trunks that he probably got before we were born," Claire said and yawned exaggeratedly. "Boring."
"What, you've got experience?" the other angel laughed, slapping the back of his hand on Uriel's shoulder that had Uriel roaring with laughter. He said something more in Enochian, receiving a reply by Uriel that made him slap his thigh in delight. Dean wrinkled his nose and decided to ignore them. But that didn't stop the heat that slowly seemed to spread on his face. Neither did it help the apprehension he felt about what was to come.
"I didn't stand a chance either, when I was on that field. I could tell very quickly," Dean said, meeting Castiel's eyes. "Why did you save me?" Castiel tiled his head, his expression puzzled. "I was the general of an invading army."
Castiel breathed in deeply and then wordlessly cast the spell. It activated at once and Castiel barely bit back a gasp as the spell wrenched open the barrier between him and Dean. Castiel had to breathe through the torrent of all the emotions mixed together, forcing himself to open up as well. His magic guided Dean's focus towards him to give it something to cling to.
Since it was in his room, it obviously was meant for him, so he examined it. It held clothing. A simple shirt and a pair of jeans. He was instinctively reminded of the hat, but upon closer inspection he was certain that this was simply regular clothing. Of the kind he had worn when he was human, though maybe slightly more expensive. Castiel wasn't sure what to do with it. Eventually he took them to the dresser, opening it for the first time since he had deposited the hat inside. He put them into the same drawer and closed it. Well, now the dresser at least had some further content.
"Of course. I'm just glad that whatever weird is happening there in Raurica, you’re at least keeping your head together enough to notice that something's off." Dean didn't want to argue about it, he wasn't even so sure anymore that Sam's worries were misplaced.
"I met a girl, her name is Harper, and I have a feeling she might be interested in me?" Jack started, sounding somewhat puzzled about it all.
"Your mom's alive?" Dean wondered. "Wait, do you even have a mom? Or did you just like… jump out of a fire or something?"
"But I'm not a child anymore. I'm 16! Why couldn't he book me a hotel room or an Air B&B like a normal person?" Emma argued. Castiel knew that there was no point in getting her out of her huffy mood, so he nodded at her.
"Just a supportive hug. No matter what happens next we're by your side, Dean," she insisted. "But what are we gonna do? Wait?"
“Cas… We’re gonna deal with that if it comes to it. The important thing is that you’re back,” Dean assured him. “Hell, I’d fight Chuck again if it meant getting you back. You’re family, Cas. It killed me that we won against Chuck but you weren’t there.” Cas looked back up, finding Dean’s expression to be open and vulnerable, just like he had seen it in Purgatory and back in the Bunker dungeon. Cas wasn’t sure what to say, suspended between gratitude and guilt.
It was Cas, but it was also not Cas. And it finally sunk in that there was really something wrong about this place Dean had been sent to. There was no way that he was still in his own universe. Cas rose to his feet and Dean had a chance to observe him. The Cas that looked back at him was younger than the one he knew, just enough to make it noticeable. He was dressed in a blue tunic that stopped over his knees and white cotton tights. His hair was longer, slightly wilder and his face was clean shaven.
"Yeah. Call it instinct, but I feel there's something there," he said and Castiel knew that this was the case. He wasn't sure who had made the initial deal with Sanders since he wasn't privy to coven information like that, but he sure hoped that whoever it was had covered their tracks well enough. Or that Sanders wouldn't talk. With a sinking feeling in the pit of his stomach Castiel realized that it was unlikely that Sanders would get another chance at upholding his end of whatever bargain they'd struck.
It had been, after all conspicuous. Too conspicuous and linked to sex to hint towards what Dean actually wanted from him.
"Well, maybe we should just move," Dean said, which apparently caught Cas off-guard. "You don't like it here either."
“How so?” Cas said, because in the short while he had with Jack after Billie’s plan for him had failed, he had been too distressed to pay attention after he had been returned to him.
"Do you think this is something we have to worry about too? You not having time?" Castiel wondered, though he wasn't particularly worried about it. He only had weekends off as well after all. Dean seemed unsure, rolling his beer bottle between his palms.
"Wouldn't dream of embarrassing you, sweetheart," Dean said and Cas snorted at the disrespectful way to address the woman, but Dr. Visyak only eyed Dean up and down with an appreciative look. That was clearly inappropriate, so Cas reached out and took the egg out of Dr. Visyak's hands. He held it in the recommended hand position, fingers splayed properly, hands maintaining a slightly raised temperature, before he pressed it gingerly to his chest. The egg was surprisingly heavy and weirdly textured, hard below with a softer rubber covering. But most interestingly was that it was warm and pulsated slightly. Really, far more advanced than it had been in high school, where they had used basketballs with painted on faces. Castiel wished Dr. Visyak a good evening and then he left the room, his steps careful and eyes looking for potential threats. Human adolescent males on skateboards with headphones on seemed the most challenging obstacle between himself and his dorm. Dean trailed after him a while later, the things in the hatching kit rattling in the box with Dean's steps.
It was gratifying to note that even with some basic training, those angels who had no previous military training didn't instantly improve either. Dean therefore assumed that angels weren't naturally super powerful, even though he was sure that even Ambriel, who tended to drop her sword and her glasses all the time, was still hard to kill. They were made out of different stuff after all.
"Nah, I promise I'll be good! Thanks, Cas! You're my savior!" she chirped, then she let herself drop into her chair and spun it around in celebration. Castiel shook his head, but he couldn't keep the smile off his face.
"Enjoy," Tessa said, quickly leaving the office to sip her coffee in peace. Dean shook his head, but then he took a deep breath, pushed all the worries of his private life aside and got to work.
"To hell with your angelic customs!" Mary shouted, clearly having given up on all sense of decorum. She wasn't here fighting as a queen anymore. This was about her son now. "Who do you think you are to make a demand on the crown prince of Winchester!"
"Really?" he wanted to know, receiving a nod from Cas in return. "I'd like that." Cas' relief was obvious. "Were you worried I would say no?"
"Oh, for the love of God," Uriel complained, but Castiel ignored him as he got back on his feet as gracefully as he could.
"So what?" Dean asked to which he got an incredulous stare. "It was my mother who banished you, right? By law I can give you permission to come into the country for a limited time, if you are accompanied. And I need your help to find Sam, alright? So, banishment partially lifted?" Castiel didn't seem convinced at all, but eventually his worry for Sam must have won out over keeping to the terms of his banishment. And what kind of witch did that? Willingly stick to human made rules when he could probably just disregard them?
"Just out with it Sam, it's far too late for your games. What exactly do you want to say?" he challenged.
"Right…," Cas muttered, turning around to face his brother. "We only just talked about it. That doesn't mean we'll have kids." Jimmy dropped all pretense that he was still putting Cas' books into boxes.
"What would traditionally be expected of any husband or wife who moves in with their spouse. Of course, Cas would request you to keep your entourage to a modest size due to the duration of the journey and the capacity of his ancestral manor, where you'll be staying. It doesn't quite have the capacity to host an entourage expected of a crown prince. His deepest apologies and all that," Gabriel answered.
"I think I have to pass, I'm sorry Dean," Sam started and Dean's face fell. "This here? Cas? This is my home," he continued and looked at Cas, then he lowered his eyes in shame. "I'm sorry… I'm sorry I ran away. It was selfish of me."
"I feel sweet today, so let's go with pancakes," Dean said cheerfully. Castiel nodded and by the time he had made sure that nobody wanted anything while he was in the kitchen Dean had already spread his usual case work out before him.
"There are some chat groups with other new students that I joined. We've been talking for weeks! And we're gonna meet up for burger and fries!" he explained, then he showed Cas his phone. "I've put together a list of things I want to do and places I want to visit!"
"So… seen any houses you like?" Cas gladly took the distraction, pulling out his phone to show Jimmy some listings he had seen.
"Of course I'm here to see my son take his next step to becoming a fully grown alpha!" Luke exclaimed, then he held out the present. "I'm here to support you and of course to bring you some extras." Jack's eyes widened in delight and he took the present eagerly. Since it only had a bow on it but no other packaging Jack could easily see that it was a brand-new laptop.
"I have no balls," Cas reminded him. "And it's not that cold," Cas said with a laugh, but followed Dean up the path to the house. The path was lined with pumpkins, three big carved ones decorating the small porch. Dean rang the doorbell and they didn't have to wait long for Mary to open the door, a big smile on her face.
They rode together in silence for a bit, aimed for Morningstar, where they would meet Uriel. Despite the initial squirming and mewling, the baby was quiet now, perfectly content sleeping against Cas' chest. Dean could feel Castiel's unease through the bond, but he somewhat calmed down as they rode on. His contemplative silence left Dean with plenty of time to think about this.
"Woah!" he shouted in surprise, but Anna's touches were quick, her palms fitting over the brand on his shoulder, then his chest, before they plucked the angel-killing dagger from its hiding place against the small of his back. Dean felt himself tense, but when Anna lifted her head to look Dean in the eye, he met her gaze with a challenging one of his own. Anna didn't say anything, but then she flipped the blade and held it out to Dean handle first.
“Dean I can’t! We don’t know what is awake in here!” Cas told him, desperate for Dean to understand. “You just got your freedom, Dean! I can’t destroy that for you!”
It was a universally acknowledged truth that dragons were not especially renowned for their hosting abilities or willingness to entertain guests in their dwellings. Apparently, Dean wasn't aware of this.
Cas felt his stomach summersault the moment the heavy look was turned and the door slowly opened on its loud hinges. And then there was Dean’s face, a frown etched into his features, green eyes wary. Cas was overcome by emotion at seeing Dean again and he couldn’t quite find his voice to greet him. He watched Dean’s eyes widen, pulling the door open further so he could face Cas properly. He looked him up and down, his mouth open when he met Cas’ eyes.
"Yeah. Come on it," Dean said, stepping back into the apartment. Did he have to help Novak get in his suitcases? Maybe that would have been the polite thing to do. But Novak was quick to grab the handles of his suitcases and pull them into the apartment. He dutifully followed Dean into his room.
"Yeah. Your mom told me she'd organize tutors, but I'd prefer to learn from you if I can," he said and was happy to see Cas' smile widen.
"I can help you, the way a partner helps. If you don't want me to throw money at you and instead just provide support while you do your thing, I can do that," Dean said. "I'm ready for some big changes, but I'm also apprehensive about rushing into things. Even though I'm sure I want all those big changes with you." Castiel smiled at him, lifting his hand to caress Dean's cheek.
"Do you hear that man?", he asked, waving his hand in the direction of the king. "Really, Castiel, are humans mad? Are you sure you want to negotiate with a mad dog?" Dean only noticed now that this Castiel guy had still been looking at Dean while John spoke. Only now he turned his head away slowly, his eyes still tracking Dean for as long as possible, and finally gave the King his full attention.  He quirked his eyebrow at the other angel, darting him a quick look before he studied Dean's parents again. His expression was calm, his face impassive. And it wasn't him who addressed the king next. Bald angel spoke again, his expression now irritated, as he waved his hands at John dismissively again:
"Right, the case," Dean said and drummed his fingers against the chair's backrest. Sam shot him a look, but then the door opened and Mary came in, still dressed in her FBI get up.
After a couple of punishing minutes the door opened on its own accord with a loud buzz. Castiel stepped through with a deep breath, leaving the cold behind but instantly feeling his mind blank uncomfortably with the slam of the door. He shivered to himself as he slowly unwound his scarf, trying to get used to the spells. Other jackets and coats hung on the metal rack on the otherwise bare wall. The murmur of the coven's talk and the chink of their glasses came from the living room around the corner, but he didn't even try to cast his mind out to get a feel of what awaited him in terms of the coven's general mood.
“I gave you the talk. You know where babies come from!” Dean said, then he jammed the key into the lock and finally opened the door.
Dean felt something had changed during those two weeks away and not only because they had accidentally acquired a baby along the way. Dean had been slow to pick up his easy affections with Cas, considering Jack was constantly attached to Cas in one way or another. But Cas had welcomed them with obvious relief. He was silent and contemplative though as they were riding back into Milton Manor, but did send Dean smiles whenever he caught him looking at him. Which, admittedly, was a lot as Dean constantly felt his eyes drawn to the man riding next to him.
“I love you too.” They hugged until Dean’s phone pinged with an alarm that told him if he didn’t get his ass moving, he’d miss his plane. But would that be so bad? He was very comfortable in Cas’ arms. Cas gave him a nudge.
"Well, you've got a boyfriend in another state," Dean told him which Castiel supposed was true. "Maybe us trying to figure out our long-distance relationship will keep you a bit busy at least." Cas smiled at him, feeling grateful to have found such a wonderful man.
"I suppose the situation with Dean is weighing on you," she said gently and took a seat when Cas gestured at the chair opposite him. He poured them both tea. "We're all a bit disappointed."
"Damn, that was a bad joke," he said and ruffled Cas' hair. Then he looked down at Castiel's stomach again. He let his hands slide down Castiel's arms and then he put his warm palms on Castiel's belly. "This is amazing… You weren't in heat so how…"
"He researched supernatural creatures?" Castiel offered, his expression open and inviting. Dean hesitated, but then something in him retreated and he looked away. He closed the journal.
"I have carried out my orders. Investigating the underlying cause of Winchester's attack on us was prudent."
Once Cas seemed more awake than asleep, Dean handed him Bobby's report. Castiel's expression cleared up further as he started reading. Dean nibbled on another piece of toast just for something to do while Cas' eyes flew over Bobby's lines. Eventually he put the letter down, a pensive expression on his face.
“It’s the same for me, Dean. Nothing has to change,” Cas promised him. Dean heaved a sigh and turned around fully to look Cas in the eye.
"Good to see that a world outside of the mountain still exists," Benny joked, but after Dean shot him a little grin, his face became serious. "What's the plan? The army can go on, but we could use a breather once we're down this mountain. It would be bad to be locked into battle right at once." Dean nodded, his eyes trained on the village closest to them, probably not even a days' march ahead. From here on out their maps weren't very helpful. Even though Dean had decided on some potential places to set up camp, there was no telling how the terrain actually looked or how the kingdom here had changed in the last couple of centuries. It was more of a gamble than Dean was comfortable admitting. But he had had worse odds. Probably.
"I guess…?" Castiel answered tentatively, then he sat down on the bed, next to the mobile phone, as if he was somehow sitting down next to Dean. "But we're still strangers, isn't that weird?"
As is customary in omega transfers, I have been discouraged from bringing furniture or more than two suitcases of clothing and personal belongings with me. I won't take up much of your space.
Dean was slightly nervous when he arrived at the address Cas had texted him. Anna Milton, a cousin apparently, lived in a nice neighborhood where all the houses looked pretty similar. But Dean could spot her house because there was a small van parked in front of it. Cas was on the sidewalk behind the van, his hands tucked into his shorts and sunglasses on. He noticed Dean and pulled his hands out of his pockets to wave and show where he could park. Dean followed his instructions, rolling down the window while Cas walked up to him. He leant down, pulling down his glassed, to peek inside the car.
"Oh. Uhm…" When Dean noticed, his grin widened. Dean sent him a charged look, then he wiped his mouth with his napkin, never breaking eye contact. He got up and held out his hand. Cas instantly dropped his fork into his plate, the rest of his spaghetti forgotten. He was much more interested in Dean taking his hand and leading him to the bedroom. He had a rough day today, clearly, he was in dire need of a Dean's thorough attentions. And if they were a bit rougher, quicker and messier than usual? Cas deserved that too.
Before Dean had to expose any further emotions, the server was back to bring them the main course and Dean was glad for the distraction.
For the last couple of hours clouds had gathered in the sky, which slowly transformed into a dark canopy overhead. It was cold and rain started to fall heavily, long before they were anywhere close to the next proper stop on the merchant route.
"Alright. So if this is what Cas assumes it is, we should go interrogate the witness now," Dean said, nodding at Cas.
"Well? Any comments?" Zachariah prompted and Dean leant back in his chair. His agenda was spread before him, not one spot free. How would a mate be able to squeeze in there? He had to tackle this differently. Arranged matings in companies that prided themselves on being the modern version of a pack weren't rare. And Dean was under no obligation to treat Mr. Novak like anything but a new employee at Sandover that happened to live with him. He would be able to keep the shared life between them minimal. With careful planning he could make it work.
“No, I’m an angel of the Lord,” Castiel informed him. Eliot stared, but apparently that had caught the interested of Max, who was approaching now.
"Dude," Dean hissed, suddenly feeling panicked and the god eyed him with a questioning look. Castiel turned his eyes away from the god to Dean, looking vulnerable. But also hopeful.
"You understand that there are certain challenges," John cautioned him. It wasn't a no so Dean straightened at once, dismissing plans to lament about his potential broken heart some more. "You are the crown prince. Even without marriage, serious changes are about to come your way, since we will want to avoid another close call with death." Dean frowned at that. Surely his dad didn't mean to finally give in to pressure to withdraw Dean from the battle field. But looking at how serious his parents looked now, he had a feeling his days on the field might be numbered.
"Oh shit," Ash said, then quickly handed Dean a shield and the training sword. Dean should be glad for his quick thinking because Uriel jumped the fence a second later and then he already swung his wooden sword in Dean's direction.
"What were you thinking?! Keeping stuff like this from me! I thought we were friends!" Gabriel moaned, but then he took a bite of his chocolate bar and chewed thoughtfully. Eventually he pointed the bar into Cas' face. "So how is Naomi going to fix this?"
"I've told my parents and Bobby about Cas not doing too well," Dean said. "I was angry that he wouldn't do anything to actually investigate what happened, even though he has the connections and the rank to pull it off. He said he'd do it his way."
"And you chose to lead your armies specifically to Enoch over the Aeries for what strategic reason?"
"If you're attached to this apartment then sure. As long as you don’t mind that I owe some stuff that would definitely disrupt the look of this apartment," he said with a laugh. "It's not very… colorful."
"Technically I'm an angel, not a dude," Cas told him, but he did wear a small smile. "But you don't have to worry about it, Dean. It takes intent on my part to ready myself for procreation, and I have no intentions of having children at this point in time. Especially not Nephilim."
For the first time in roughly 20 years Dean regretted the Winchester family alpha-vaganza birthday tradition.
"I suppose. I did teach my children human languages, knowing it might be useful. Almost every angel learns some human languages nowadays but I'm not sure it's worth it."
"Great! Then that's a deal!" Dean decided, then he stretched, feeling every muscle in his body hurt now that the adrenaline had worn off a bit. "Is there an inn nearby? I've been on a horse for too long."
"As they say; no rest for the wicked. ;)" Cas stared at the message. Sure, he had absolutely no clue about things like these, but was this flirting? Or was Mr. Winchester -
There was no reason for Sam and Dean to worry, no reason for them to know. Because they would worry, if they knew. Maybe they’d be disappointed and maybe they’d not let him come with them anymore on hunts. And that made the irritating bubbling feeling inside of him get worse. No. No, they didn’t need to know.
"I'll do what I can to fix it," Cas told him and Dean knew he meant it. It just made him feel useless to know that there was nothing that he could contribute. He was just a human and this was much bigger than him. All that he could do, now, was to wrap his arms around Cas and soak up the comfort.
"What are you doing anyway?" Castiel dared to ask, sitting down in the chair next to Dean. Dean moved slightly and it was probably no accident that their knees bumped.
"You're unsettled," he decided, his mouth pulling down into a frown. Dean didn't like how exposed the words made him feel, so he merely shrugged.
"He argued that it would only be proper to also invite my husband, since you're the crown prince of Winchester and he'd be delighted to host such an
“Sam’s fine,” Dean said with a sigh. He moved his position, bending out of frame and Cas heard a thunk. Dean came back into frame, the hand that had previously held the beer bottle going through his hair. Cas only noticed now that it was longer than Cas was used to, some strands hanging into his face before Dean wiped them back. How much time had passed…? “He’s out, helping Donna on a hunt.”
"Guys, I'd love to hang out, but I really should get back to my own world," he said, causing the bickering to die down at once. His counterpart studied him, his eyes gleaming bright.
"Ridiculous! We would have dealt with one measly human! Even if it is Sam Winchester!" Raphael argued loudly. Michael lifted his hand. He looked at Naomi and Gabriel, then he looked back to Raphael.
"Millie will do. Or Grandma Millie," she told him softly, then she held out her hand. "Hand me your plate, will you?"
"Yeah, happens to the best of us," Dean said and shot Cas an encouraging smile, then he pulled the apple pie close. "Maybe Gabriel could help you out, but it's not like you seem to be hurting for people eating your pie."
"Oh, oh I don't think I can tell you anything else that I haven't told the police yet" he stuttered, suddenly very interested in the windows.
"It was Rowena's Rapunzel. She got the seeds for a very high price and she cultivated them to contain magic. It wasn't quite worth a first-born but Rowena thought she could exchange me for more power in the wild forest."
"I've been trying to convince Castiel to just let me deliver his sweets, because mine are obviously leagues better, but he's a stubborn son of a bitch." Castiel shot Gabriel a glare. "No insult to your mom intended." Dean raised his eyebrow which was Gabriel's cue to point at the pecan pie. "Go on. Sample it. You can eat apple pie after.)
"I don't understand," Castiel voiced when Mary took him back to the main street. "Humans are very complex."
"It's been centuries since anybody last tried to talk with the angels. And even 300 years ago they weren't very inviting. They're a secretive bunch," Charlie said but while she was excited just to learn more, Dean felt his frustration growing with each day. Each day wasted with endless council meetings, wasted with research that led nowhere. When the library didn't prove to be useful, Dean had to try other means.
"What? She didn't trust us grimy humans with boring old paintings?" Dean asked with a laugh which Hannah answered with a shrug.
A stiff breeze made him shiver in his jacket. Still dumbstruck he made a turn to try to figure out what the hell had just happened. He was standing in the middle of a small circle of some weird standing stones. He doubted he was still in the US.
"First of all, being someone's rebound sex can be fun, but isn't generally a good idea," Dean said, which was followed by Jack humming. "Do you even want to have sex with her?"
"It's a gesture. I don't sleep, but if I did – and assuming I wouldn't do it by your side – I would want your smile to start and end a day." Cas felt the need to explain it.
"No, you-" Castiel wanted to interrupt but the crow cried out in warning and Castiel was momentarily distracted.
He heard Benny shout, noticing the movement close by a second too late. A blinding pain slashed through his chest. He gasped, the breath leaving him in a voiceless shout. The world titled and he knew he was falling. His back connected heavily with the ground. He stared up at the sky with wide eyes, feeling nothing but pain. Somewhere in his line of vision he saw the banner of Winchester fluttering in the bright blue sky. And as he lay there in blood-spattered, delicate flowers he knew that he was going to die.
"I'm doing great. My wings were broken and constantly in pain before. I'm glad that has changed," Castiel said and Dean felt a pang of guilt and sadness to hear that. He would never forget the image of Castiel's ashy wing imprints in the dungeon and how they'd looked compared to the mighty shadow wings he'd seen before. He lifted his hand to put it on Castiel's shoulder, as a sign of support. "And no," Castiel added. "I'm not dying to fly away." He took the last step separating them and kissed Dean.
"You cannot! I forbid you! If you do not follow my orders this is treason and you will be punished with banishment!" That did put a crack in Castiel's heart, but it did not break his resolve.
"Uh, you were late for breakfast and I have news." Castiel frowned and looked at the window where the sky was already blue.
"Somehow I doubt that. Of course, they have the power," Lady Bevell said, her voice low. Dean turned his head to study her. She was close to him in age, her face yet untouched by war, but there was a tiny thin scar across her eyebrow which had been caused by an errant wooden toy.
“Is your partner framing it this way? That you would be disappointing him? Or is that thought coming from you?” Mia wondered. Castiel instinctively bristled at the suggestion that Dean would pressure Cas this way.
Some crows had gathered to enjoy the last rays of reddish sunlight on the roof of his tower. Castiel was tracing the childish scribbles Sam had etched into the window sill when he had been 5 years old and almost given Cas a heart attack by climbing up to the window. A croak came from above, startling Castiel out of his mindless staring. He breathed in deeply to get a grip and then he turned his head sharply upwards when he heard the flutter of many wings, indication of the crows' take-off. He leant out of the window in case the crows were saying a well-mannered good-bye. The message displayed however was the following:
“You’re welcome. Now try to get some sleep. It’s late.” Jack was about to protest, because he didn’t need sleep, but decided against it. Maybe sleep would help his soul heal.
“Yeah,” Cas decided and got comfortable in his seat. His coat was rumbled under him and he felt the shape of his phone dig into his leg. He pulled the coat free and then grabbed his phone. Claire had send him a thumbs up emoji.
Castiel returned to the counter and he saw Naomi's hawk like eyes fixed on Dean, clearly seeing the tendrils of magic. Dean poured maple syrup over his pancakes, cutting absent-mindedly. He put a piece in his mouth, chewing slowly. Dean swallowed his first mouthful. It was enough, the task was done and Naomi nodded at him.
"No…," Castiel said, and that was all the witch catcher forced him to say, but still he found more words spilling out: "I never wanted to be part of them. I never wanted to be a witch or get initiated into the coven."
"How will you solve this challenge?" Gabriel asked when Mary was close. She tensed, observing Gabriel warily. Sam was still out of reach, she had to plan carefully if she wanted to snatch him and get him to safety. No matter what Gabriel was planning, it couldn't be good. "Will you solve it as a wife? As a mother? As a queen?" Gabriel's voice was loud, carrying through the entire room as the people awaited the announcement of the challenge. "Prove to us who you are, you who banishes good magic but invites in the dark to get back what you love."
. But there's no trouble for Cas to get into now, you know? Lucifer is dead, the Brits have been chased off and with the Grace extraction we did, Kelly's baby is not going to end the world."
"Oh, come on…" Castiel muttered, rolling his eyes. Luckily, Jack only seemed to be vaguely interested in this topic. He was much more interested in getting out of the elevator and to his room. He got out his key and unlocked the door. They all piled inside and Cas was surprised how spacious and nice it was. There was a small lounge area, a door that led to a bathroom and then two single rooms also closed off with a door.
Dean was back to staring at his phone, Cas unresponsive. This morning he'd felt anger and guilt but now he just felt abandoned.
"Because there's gossip. I'm surprised that she didn't come check you out earlier," Cas explained. "There's no privacy here," he added. Upon seeing Cas' disgruntled expression Dean had to laugh.
"I don't think that's wise. It might give us the impression that you want to expand into human lands," he answered. Anna huffed.
"And how long will you be staying here?" Castiel asked, redirecting his thoughts towards something less gloomy. He was fishing for information now that Dean had opened up about working a case.
"My family took an interest in him," he said and that was already dangerous territory and Cas tensed. "I don't know if you two already are at the exchanging of tragic backstory part of your relationship, but he came into the extended family as a foster kid," Gabriel said.
"The King will see you now," a guard called and Dean quickly finished his snacks, before he got up, following Castiel.
“Well, I am 2,” Jack informed him in case Cas had forgotten. Castiel laughed at that, then he put his hand on Jack’s shoulder, his expression open and happy.
"Sam Winchester," Castiel said, not having to guess. Dean had been kind of tight-lipped about his family, but he had shown him pictures of Sam.
"Yes, I suppose so," Castiel agreed. "I've received a contract. My working hours at Sandover will be reduced to part time. I'll be paid for housework I'm expected to do as a mated omega."
They met some other angels on the way to Cas' room, all of them smiling and greeting Dean. It was pretty clear that gossip about Dean and Cas spread quickly.
"You're staying here," he said sharply. Dean opened his mouth to protest, but Cas continued before Dean could say anything: "The aim is not to get your citizens to shut up, but to reassure them. At least make sure that the unity within Winchester holds. That will be the job of the crown and Bobby."
"Some young alphas think they're all grown up and don't need their parents anymore," Mary eventually said after Dean had stopped snickering. Castiel seemed to ponder that.
"I'd love to see it," he said, shaking his head. "But we can't really do anything from here. It's possible that a guy called Lucifer is involved somehow. He's the king of the country that borders on our enclave and Kendrick. We can't go there, but I informed Bobby about what I learnt. If they can go to the border town, maybe they can get a clearer picture of what exactly happened. As to Lucifer… well, he's definitely out of reach for us."
“But at what cost? If I will be returned to Earth then everything that’s been awake in the Empty follows in my wake,” Castiel argued while Amara regarded him mildly. “Maybe some angels will come back, helping stabilize Heaven. But demons will be unleashed too. And things that predate even you!”
"I've been eating well," he said flatly. Of course, Bobby knew the rumours. Of how Castiel had ended up in a witch's service because his parents exchanged him for corn salad. He doubted that was true, but unfortunately for Castiel, the rumours were very accurate. The price of corn salad had greatly exceeded the value of first-born sons those days. Or at least on that particular day, for that particular witch and that particular unfortunate slob of a father.
"Uh… No…" he started, slightly unnerved when Naomi only stared. "I was actually looking to talk to Castiel." Naomi arched a brow, though she still looked unimpressed. She folded the letter up, rose from her chair and put the letter into her pocket.
"You could have held us back. Meet us on the mountain, block us from even entering your land," Dean concluded.
"I'm not sure I want this, Cas," he finally said and when he looked up he already found Cas' eyes on him.
"Therefore, it stood to reason that since you survived, you weren't safe in Winchester either." Dean shook his head, not sure if he wanted to laugh at this ridiculous suggestion.
a real dragon," Castiel said, his eyes narrowed. Dean shrugged dismissively. "I am a real dragon, just like you! And what is it with you and sheep stealing?"
"But… this is the men's shelter, is it not?" The man shot him something of a distracted nod but the way he lifted his eyebrows at him seemed to suggest some form of complicated nonverbal communication. Cas had never been good at communication, even when he still had had all his angelic capacities.
"No, it's Swiss," Castiel explained and that didn't make immediate sense to Dean. But then he recalled where they were. The motel had Swiss in its name and the sign outside of town had welcomed them to
"Yeah…" Dean muttered and Castiel wondered if there was something he had found that he wasn't telling him yet, some hint at their coven activities.
As it turned out, Hael did have a solid understanding of sword fighting, but did definitely lack training. It wasn't hard to anticipate her movements, block her tentative attacks or even disarm her. Hael seemed to be enjoying herself though, thanking him for his time. Of course, that only led to more angels wanting to have a match against Dean, though he felt more like an attraction at a fair, a game for the angels to play, than an actual serious sparring partner.
"An omega, huh…? Can't say that I saw that one coming," Dean said, but before Cas could worry about this being another failure to put on the pile of things to be sad about, Dean started to grin. "Kinda awesome. I never could smell you properly. You just smelled… otherworldly, like a storm, but I could never read you. But now…"
." Luke made a show of taking out his phone and typing on it. "Which, as a scroll through their website shows, is a lingerie brand for omega men." Luke put the phone back in his pocket and lifted his eyebrows expectantly. "And clearly the lingerie you buy is intended to be seen by me."
"I can't fault the guy, food and physical affection are the best," Dean joked, then he turned around, rolling on top of Cas. "Don't you think?" Cas laughed, raising his hands to hold Dean's face.
Dean would have said that he "endured" the little celebratory dinner Naomi required of them, but it was actually nice to have the hall full of chatter and happy faces. He did have to deal with his friends making fun of him for having his sex-life celebrated, but everyone accepted that it was just another strange angelic custom. Besides, they were all just glad that they had reached a kind of rapport with the angels and none of them were actually feeling like prisoners in Milton Manor anymore. Of course, Dean still wasn't allowed to go wherever he wanted to go, in theory, but he wasn't sure if anyone would still enforce it and he wasn't about to try to find out.
"You okay?" Cas asked, when Dean was lingering by the car, just as Jack decided he had waited enough. "Jack!" he called but Jack was already ringing the door-bell. Cas heaved a sigh.
While Castiel was cautious for a while, he soon relaxed as the man read a newspaper and had his pie and coffee. The storm was still going strong outside, howling and beating rain against the windows. It had dimmed down more and no new guests stumbled into the café, not that Castiel had expected any. Or wanted them, for that matter. The stranger seemed content to relax, getting more coffee, waiting out the rain. Once it was almost time for closing, he called for Castiel to pay.
"He's a bit too old to really care for me tucking him into bed. Sometimes I forget that he's 18," Cas said.
,” Dean said with a tense smile. “I’m talking to my best friend trapped in some sort of hell dimension and I’m not sure if I haven’t passed out and am dreaming all of this.” The comforting warmth Cas had basked in was gradually replaced by worry. Never mind Dean’s rather persistent doubt, it was not a good sign for Dean to drink heavily.
human kingdoms!" Gasps went through the guests and Mary stared at Sam in horror. "Look at the boy, so adorable, so innocent, but upon his 18
"But for how long?" Donna wanted to know. "If the High King agrees to pardon Winchester based on the information Cas will give him, then there's also no more reason for the treaty between Cas and your parents. Our stay here will have lost legitimacy and if you aren't reinstated properly, which means a physical return to court, Winchester might lose credibility."
"And you don't think he's too good to be true?" Amelia suggested and a second later Jimmy had his phone out.
"Hey, Cas. Long time no see," he said with a wink. Visyak frowned down at her sheet when Dean and Cas were standing before her.
"You're a hunter, Dean. I know why you've asked but I can't tell you anything," Cas told him, his tone softer now too, almost tired. Dean still felt like an ass, even if he knew Cas wasn't really upset with him. He put his arm around Cas shoulder and pulled him close.
"Fuck!" Dean hissed. The turbulence returned and Cas leaned over the arm rest to wrap his arms around Dean.
“Even if, I don’t really see Jack going on a bender,” Dean said and even though he tried, his brain immediately blocked out the mere though. Nah, that wasn’t Jack. Cas made a non-committal sound in the back of his throat that came across as somewhat doubtful, but then he finished folding the laundry and handed Dean the hamper to carry up to their room.
"Really?" Dean asked and his excitement was hard to deny. Cas nodded at him and Dean grinned. "That's awesome. I was definitely getting rusty. Thanks, Cas."
It held as they brought Kelly to a safe place and extracted the Grace once they assured her that this was the only way she would survive. It held as they stored the kid's Grace, swirling in a pale gold, into one of the Bunker's heavy-duty vaults. It held when they said good-bye to Kelly who had a small, hopeful smile on her lips. And it still held when they came to find Cas again.
"I will help the innkeeper with the preparations for the food and the bath. You should change into dry clothes," Castiel said. Dean was about to tell him he should do the same, but Cas was already out of the door.
"I promise, we'll believe what you'll tell us," Dean promised but Drought was only getting more frantic, pressing his lips together. Dean rolled his eyes with a groan, closing his notebook and turning to Cas.
"Not now. We're not doing this now," Dean growled, then he pressed himself close to Cas, who lifted his arms out of the way, so their chests were connected and Dean could feel the vibrations of the souls burning inside Cas. He felt Castiel's fingertips brushing against his sides and his back, little spots of heat, chased by a chill.
"So what? You won't find out anything if you don't risk it!" Dean argued fiercely, knowing that Cas was the best shot they had at uncovering the truth. Even if Winchester sent people over to the human settlements, they would have no access at all to Lucifer. Forget Cas being their best shot; he was their
"You're a sap," Dean managed to say, when Dean was in Cas' room the next time. Nothing much had changed, but there now were several pictures on the desk of Sam, Jack and Mary. And of course, in an antique frame and next to his bed was one of Dean. A beautiful picture of him, with a full, genuine smile.
"Then he should better get a horse," Anna said and motioned towards one of her angels. It took almost no time at all for Benny to be next to Dean, his expression veering between apprehensive but also relieved.
The weeks that followed were characterized by great comfort, but also an underlying melancholy. Growing up Dean had imagined what marriage would be like, once he had to do his duty and take a wife. His imagination had never been quite as comforting and enjoyable as it actually was with Cas. Of course, Dean wasn't here as a prince, his duties were limited and his free time ample, even if he spent some hours in the library each day, to study while Cas attended to Jack or his angelic duties. Cas had sent word to Anna, Naomi and Michael and Dean knew that he was continuing his efforts to push for his convictions regarding human and angel interaction. Anael, who Dean had only met briefly that one time, had spent an entire week in the manor, listening to Cas propose change. Since she was wholly uninterested in Jack, Cas had begged Dean to watch him, which forced Dean to actually spend time with Jack on his own for a change. The kid had initially grumbled and whined when Cas wasn't within eyesight, but his eyes had flashed golden once, his little face intense, and then he mellowed out. Dean assumed this was what communion looked like. After that Jack had been a pretty laid-back kid for Dean to deal with, accepting the bottle and luckily refrained from pooping his pants for Dean to clean up, leaving the less savory parts of parenting to Cas.
"So you know?" Cas wondered. Dean shrugged. "Of course I blessed you. The crown prince must be blessed. Bobby told your mother he took you to fairies, but the future king should be blessed by a witch. It's just right."
Dean gave up trying to do this with his mind first, letting his instincts take over. This was a bond seeking to be completed, so he just let it take over and guide him. He wasn't trying to hold back with caresses, and neither with the rough and quick pace that made him chase release. Cas seemed to be way beyond forming words and Dean at least had enough presence of mind to wrap his hand around Cas' dick and jerk him to a quick orgasm, no finesse, all intensity. Cas tensed under him, his fingers digging into Dean's back before he threw his head back to gasp soundlessly, shaking through his orgasm. Dean wasn't far behind, chasing it quickly. It took barely anything for him to push in deep and let his orgasm white out all thought and leave behind nothing but raw bliss. He felt energy course through him, like something inside of him just burst open and he heard whispers in the back of his head but everything was fuzzy and overwhelming, an intense weight pressing in on him, pressing against his mind with tiny tingling fingers of intent. He felt a rush of sadness and longing, with little glimmering bits of elation. And then it disappeared, like a window slamming shut, leaving the raging storm outside.
"Great," Dean grumbled, getting up from his seat to close the doors the angel had left wide open. "What do you want?" Gabriel grinned at him.
"And trust Castiel to show up underdressed to his own initiation," Michael commented, which Castiel rewarded with a small, unimpressed look.
"I understand. Is there any evil ailing you that you need help with?" the god asked, following Dean's lead when he decided that he had seen enough of this dungeon for a long time. Maybe he could convince Sam to clean because he doubted he'd set foot in here for a long time. Dean pondered the god's question when they made their way into the kitchen. He wasn't sure why he was leading him here, but now that he was here a cup of coffee seemed like a good idea.
Dean came across it by accident. He didn't mean to snoop, but he was someone who liked to touch and fiddle with things. And maybe he got curious and wondered why Cas had a jewelry box in their bedroom, placed next to a photo of a beautiful red-haired woman smiling into the camera. He knew her to be Cas' mom Anna, who had died when he was still young, but Cas didn't really come out with further information and Dean knew what it was like to lose a parent and how though it still was to talk about it decades later. But he was curious and Cas had never said anything about it. So here Dean was with a worn, old looking necklace dangling from his fingers. The string was leather and pretty unassuming, but at the end was a pendant that looked eerily out of place in Castiel's house. Of course, Dean could be wrong, but he was almost sure that this was a ward against witches, not all that different to the ones he had in his arsenal. But how did something like this come into Cas' possession? Frowning, Dean's eyes slipped from the pendant to the box and then to the picture. The woman in the pic had a black string around her neck, but the necklace disappeared under her shirt, so he couldn't say if this was Cas' mother's.
Clearly, sleeping in the cart wasn't really comfortable. Castiel suppressed a groan when he hopped off of the cart, slowly stretching. They had reached the next big town on the route, the second to last before they reached the coast. The landscape here was already starting to look different, the wind blowing in had a different freshness to it and there were seagulls up in the air, calling out loudly.
Dean didn't even look up long enough from his reading to scrutinize the pancakes or see the stiff expression on Castiel's face.
"Let me ask you something, of both of you," Lucifer started and Dean looked at him curiously. "We've followed a particular path regarding humans for 600 years. And it allowed Winchester to become a great kingdom, as far as human kingdoms can be great. But what will happen now?"
"It's okay Sam, everything's okay," he said, hugging Sam. The young man reacted at once, pulling Cas close, breathing heavily into his shoulder. Dean watched the scene with a small smile, but his stance was still alert.
"Dean, yes," Castiel told him impatiently and Dean complied, putting pressure against Cas' hole until his finger slipped in without resistance. He moved it around lightly, but a second finger slipped in just as easily.
"It's in your best interest that you come with me to Enoch now," she said with a smile. "If it helps you then just consider this another of your missions. You have been to many battles before, haven't you?" Dean wasn't sure what to reply to that.
"When I told father about you, he said that no self-respecting alpha would want dad now because he already had a kid. Apparently real alphas think that an omega loses appeal if they already had another alpha's child," Jack explained.
"For the moment our arrangement works, but I know it's taking a toll on Dean to travel so often. I'd be happy to move in together, wherever that might eventually end up being, but right now I have a son to see off to college. And I'll need time to get used to that change. I know Jack's dad and my family will remain close even if I move away, but I'm not ready to be hours apart. Not yet…," he answered and Dean was a bit in awe at his level of diplomacy. Dean would have probably told his parents to stop being so nosy if Cas hadn't spoken up.
Jack remembered how he had walked into the kitchen many months ago, following a strange sound. He found the kitchen empty, but it was clear that Dean had been cooking as there was a pot was on the stove. Something was bubbling in it. Jack had stood there in the kitchen watching it. Gradually the bubbling got louder and it started to rattle the lid on top of it, bursts of stream escaping, fluid leaking down onto the stove top, hissing as it evaporated.
"Get on your horse," Castiel advised Dean and the prince was too apprehensive to waste any time asking questions. Castiel took Impala's reins and he held out the light. Then they started moving. As soon as they had set foot into the forest, Dean cursed. It was dark and cold like during winter. Impala moved nervously but Castiel tugged at the reins, whispering something to her, and she calmed down.
“It’s silly actually,” Dean said with a deep sigh. “Just Dad, Sam and me getting drunk off our asses and calling it a manly bonding experience. I could spend it with you. Make it the special omega birthday bash with you and mom?” Castiel laughed but never stopped folding the laundry.
A part of Castiel feverishly hoped that Dean had left Raurica but of course the bell chimed and the hunter stepped into the café. Castiel's stomach churned but he had to calm down. He showed Dean a shaky smile and headed over to him once he sat down. As always when other patrons were present, Dean kept on his jacket and with it all his weapons. His eyes swept the room, lingering on Naomi longer than any other morning patron. Dean's instincts were marvelous.
And he understood them, to a certain degree. Buying a house meant settling down, but it also came with a host of other implications that his family was – as it turned out once Jimmy came over for a friendly interrogation– irritatingly good at picking up on.
"I understand. I will consider it," John finally agreed and Bobby sent Dean a small, approving smile. "You got better at concerning yourself with questions of diplomacy."
"I bet," she said, "just be sure to see to Cas' pleasure as well." That took some of the wind out of Dean's sails.
. I tried so hard and yet you do not want me.” He sounded curious as he said it, almost as if he just recognized this. There was no judgment or anger in his voice, but the weight of his gaze was terrible. Almost sad.
"But also happy, right?" Jack asked. "Because you don't like your job, you don't like the apartment. But you do like Dean."
"I didn't smell anything else," Cas muttered, annoying that they were both laughing about something that had caused him so much distress.
"What do you want to know?" Cas asked uneasily. "I think condoms work for alpha dragons as well as they do for human men. So maybe you should focus on contraceptives…?" Dean laughed at that.
"Why would the King and Queen send their heir into such a foolish and deadly trap?" he wondered to which Anna shrugged.
"Am I doing this right?" Castiel asked, looking at her."I'm untrained with children." Mary seemed surprised but she quickly smiled. She got up and walked to him, holding out her arms. Castiel handed her the baby who grumbled when Cas didn't hold him anymore.
"I have no idea. Gabriel assured me that Cas isn't the kind of guy to punish others for my missteps. And that an apology would go a long way… But I just don't know…" he said. Benny sighed.
"But Dean… isn't this whole thing temporary? You do want to go back to Winchester, right? Because I do… I like it here, but I miss home," Charlie admitted. "And you're supposed to be the next king… Can you be the next king while you're Lord of Milton Manor?" That dampened Dean's mood way more than Naomi's criticism of his lack of harp playing skills did. The thought of leaving Cas actually stung and he felt an immense sense of reluctance to even think about it. If it was the bond unwilling to be severed again, or if it was just Dean who had gotten used to having something like a lover and didn't want to lose that comfort yet… He couldn't tell.
"Get up! And get in the damn car," he ordered, his voice hard. Castiel resigned himself to it. He got up slowly and walked around the front of the car to the passenger seat. "Just great," he heard Dean grumble but it didn't take magic to know that Dean's anger didn't reach deep enough to chase away the hurt.
"So far yes but I think that Michael might soon come to a decision regarding Dean. I don't expect him to reprimand me, but maybe someone else will challenge my decisions… And if they demand retribution against Winchester… I'm not sure I will be able to follow my orders…," he admitted. Hannah studied him silently, but Cas wasn't sure if she was judging him for his admission. "I would have liked human-angel contact, I had hoped having Dean here would allow for it to spark…"
"Toss everything inside. Those get cleaned professionally to remove all traces of slick and scent," Cara explained. "And Alphas. This is an omega shelter. Horny alphas are always sniffing around the perimeter. Doesn't help that some of the omegas take the chance to make them clients." Castiel frowned and shot Cara a look after he had stuffed all the sheets into the bag. "Prostitution, Cas. We don't encourage it and we certainly don't allow it in the shelter, but we can't tell you what to do. And we see a lot of desperate omegas here. No home, no job, but being alive costs money," Castiel knew that there was an unvoiced question hidden in her words.
Dean's phone started ringing and Dean sighed internally. Probably Adler again, with some other problem for him to fix. He picked up the receiver without looking at the caller ID.
"No, there has never been time for a partner, so I don't…" Dean bit back on what he meant to say. How would a mate possibly fit into the life Dean had built for himself? Dean didn't know how to share his life with anyone or how to make space for someone as monumentally important as a mate. He couldn't manage a partner for long and all the Sandover pack bonding activities were nothing but superficial and for show. He had raised Sam for years and after their separation he now even found it difficult to reconnect with his estranged sibling. How the hell would he manage a mate?
"Haha, very funny," Dean grumbled, though he supposed that she was right. Dean was feeling much, much better. The prospect of moving in with Cas was really lifting his spirits. He was even looking forwards to all the shopping they'd have to do together to make the place their home.
"And…" Dean tilted his head backwards looking for strength in the pattern of his ceiling. "Don't knot her, okay? Trust me, I know you might want to in the heat of the moment, but it would be awkward."
"I would like that too, thank you Dean. And I'm sorry… that I don't remember you from back then." Dean laughed at Sam's contrite expression.
"Thank you, Dean," Cas said with a small smile, feeling a pleasant glow settle over the constant ache in his chest. Dean only mumbled something and continued sipping his coffee.
"Okay, cool," Dean said with a shrug and then he got handed the box. Visyak then lifted the egg off the table.
"You call what we're doing here visiting?" Dean asked with a frown, "because I thought we're here as political prisoners."
"Ha, was it though?" Lucifer asked, his grin simply widening. Dean realized that Lucifer was the kind of guy who knew that he'd get away with pretty much anything. Those people were a pain in the ass to deal with. "Not everybody looks favorably on your decision to let the humans off this lightly. Some might even find it a disgrace, or even think it's treason that you are now investigating where you are investigating."
"Uh… thanks…?" Dean muttered, feeling embarrassed to have been caught. But the girls merely laughed.
"He might be able to fix the whole cosmic consequences bullshit," Dean said and Castiel narrowed his eyes.
"Well, I'm glad you took the initiative," Dean assured him and gave his hand a squeeze. "And I really like how you look tonight. I can't wait to get you out of your clothes."
"One last time," he said, as he studied him, then he shook his head and left. Castiel bit his lips, then he sunk down on the chair. He couldn't stop the tears from coming. The Impala roared outside and then it sped off, its tires screeching.
"I try not to," Castiel said dryly, but a smile was tugging at the corner of his lips. Dean snorted, but then he put his hand on Cas' cheek. For a long moment they stared at each other, waiting for something to happen, but nothing did.
Cas hadn't enjoyed himself like this in years. Dean was very easy to spend time with, even outside of lying on the beach and having sex. Cas had never really considered himself a person who was particularly interested in sex, but it turned out he did enjoy having sex and he did fantasize about having sex when he wasn't having it. At least when it got to Dean, who clearly enjoyed sex a lot and had no qualms about admitting it. But he also said no such thing like this was in his nature as an alpha and he definitely didn't spend half his time ogling other people while at the beach with Cas.
Before he could revisit all the things he had endlessly thought about during the drive, Dean opened the door. Castiel felt himself sag in relief, seeing Dean apparently fine, if somewhat sleep tousled.
"Unfortunately, it's not me who found the storage. Someone broke into the storage unit, took some items out and now somebody's dead."
"A sight for sore eyes!" the god said excitedly and took the basket from Cas, who then opened the clasp of his coat and hung it on a hook by the door.
"I hadn't officially presented yet. I didn't have to go," he told him and Cas rolled his eyes. "You can't blame me for being a late bloomer. Or trying to get out of that nonsense. I had way better things to do with my time than go cuddle some basketballs."
Dr. Visyak checked her watch, then she counted heads. "We seem to be one person short, but let's get started already." People settled after Visyak sent the muttering people a glare, her eyes flashing silver in warning. "I know you have better things to do, we all have, but the State is very concerned about the staggering number of egg mishandling and nest abandonment, especially among young people. Our numbers are small and we dragons have adapted to the requirements of the predominantly human culture around us. Most of us no longer live in packs, most of us didn't grow up with a pack omega to teach us everything about proper nest care and hatching techniques. Some of you, probably the girls, got to play with Hatching dolls, but as we all know the modern hatching doll is human toy companies' attempt at pulling dragons and other egg laying species into their consumer fold." Some people chuckled. Deriding humans for trying to sell them things was something dragons enjoyed doing, at least in the privacy of dragon only circles. In any case, Cas' older sister had played with hatching dolls and when Anna had handed them to Cas after she grew out of it, he realized that they were not only boring but also wildly inaccurate.
“Why am I here?” Castiel asked, his voice dancing like stars through space, ruffling Amara’s blonde hair. “I was in the Empty. I was…” Castiel startled, looking down towards his human form, still cradling something. The phone! Dean!
Dean momentarily felt the heat, but it didn't hurt him. Within a moment they were out of the fire, in a big hall.
"I don't… I don't know," he muttered, not meeting anyone's eyes. Castiel sent Dean a look, lowering his eyelids in a way that Dean knew meant "let me deal with him, I can crack him". Dean shook his head at Cas.
As Anna had said, most of the angels who had travelled with her took their leave, departing into the direction of to the town that Dean could see not far from here. Their party was reduced to only a handful of angels, the wagons with Dean's belongings, and of course Dean's loyal friends. Even though Dean knew that the angels were now technically outnumbered, he quickly dismissed any thought of trying to attack and make a run for it. He was done underestimating them.
"No problem," Gabriel said with a grin, then he turned towards the other pagan gods. "And you boys? Do you want a ride into the mystical land of an alternative future?"
“I visited Jimmy and Amelia yesterday,” Cas said. “We celebrated because Dr. Vallens called me back and gave me the green light.” Dean stopped eating and looked at Cas with a small frown. But after a moment he was evidently able to place the name.
"That is impossible," she admonished, a hint of reprimand in her voice because clearly John wasn't taking this as seriously as he should.
Even though Cas did his best to avoid his mother, he took a slow moment at work to call her. He had the egg on a little cushion under the counter, close enough to frequently check the temperature and cover it up with blankets if necessary.
"But… if possible," he started, looking from Cas to Dean. "I would like to see you again on Sunday? Maybe Grandma Millie will make us pancakes?"
"Come on babe, it's where I do my secret stuff. Research monster lore and creepy spells observed by nothing but your flower tapestry," Dean said passionately, but Cas just shot him a look and then he disappeared down the hall into the guest room. Dean chuckled to himself and then he breathed in deeply, feeling himself relax. It was good to be back.
"Do you even have a soul?" Dean asked dubiously which seemed to offend the god, so Dean lifted his hand in a placating manner. God Dean didn't have the chance to start a lecture on souls, or whatever else he had geared himself up to saying, because the sound of the door opening reached them. Not much later Castiel was back in the room with them, a basket in his arms that he presented proudly.
The only suspicious elements in the house were Anna's pendant and whatever Dean had carried into the house. Dean sat down heavily in his chair and stared down at his desk. There was absolutely nothing that hinted at Cas being anything other than what he said.
"Great, how about tomorrow? Text me your address and I'll pick you up at six," Dean suggested and Castiel nodded eagerly. Dean grinned. "Awesome." He turned his head to the side and when Castiel followed his line of sight, he saw Emma approaching. "Gotta warn you though, I have a kid." Dean said with a wink.
it take to play a game? And what if it was a whole game series and he never came home, the lure of the comfort of luxury and the never-ending supply of snacks too strong?) Luckily for Cas, he at least could share his sorrows with Dean now, who might chuckle a bit at Cas' laments about his son's current game addiction, but generally had an open ear for the more serious underlying reasons for Cas' unhappiness.
"You've done enough, Rapunzel," an old lady spoke up and Dean looked at her in surprise. "You've done enough good to last the kingdom for decades."
"Hm, I don't know," Dean said, his voice dropping down a bit, which made Cas look at him. They were at a red light now and Dean took the moment to send him a look. "There are some alphas out there who find that pretty sexy." Castiel felt his cheeks burn at that, surprised by Dean's suggestive smile and wink, before he had to drive again, leaving Cas to his thoughts.
"It was a stupid plan," Cas added unhelpfully and Dean fought the urge to roll his. But the god looked over his shoulder to study Dean as well. His dark eyes were hard to read and his expression was carefully neutral. Without a word he looked back down at Castiel who was still stretched out on the table, not looking any stiffer than he usually did.
The next morning, Cas and Dean were greeted by tumult. People were out on the streets, looking towards the coast, worried, hands in front of their mouths.
"Years and years ago… During the war, when our village was close to being destroyed because the kingdom didn't have enough troops to hold back all demonic armies and small villages of less strategic importance were left to fend for themselves." Dean's heart sunk at that, knowing that the crown had failed the people of the village. He opened his mouth to apologize but the old lady waved him off. "Don't you worry about the hard choices of generations before you. It was war and there was nothing else the king's army could have done," she said and Dean nodded, subdued. "We knew nobody would come as the demonic banners approached. But then," the old lady stopped, breathing in deeply, and looked at Castiel. "
Dean felt the god approach, radiating heat and power. He lowered himself to his knees, then he put his hand over the fatal wound. His eyes were still glowing blue and then small tendrils of power, looking like glittering smoke, wrapped around the god's arm, reaching down until they met Castiel's chest.
Castiel couldn't help the two or three frustrated tears slipping free, but he wiped them away carelessly. This wasn't necessary. He had no reason to be so upset. It was like Miriam had said; Dean didn't like his scent. It was alright. They could still be friends, maybe even family. Just not… mates. Maybe they didn't need to be mates as it had never even come up before. But what if Dean didn't want to kiss either? What if… what if Cas couldn't?
Castiel was glad to be able to sit down though he made an effort not to sigh in relief. It wasn't that he felt exhausted, but the prospect of standing for much longer simply didn't appeal all that much to him. Especially while he was still dealing with the imbalance in his core. Uriel had sprawled out in the plush armchair the moment they got into the sitting room provided to them by their current host. Castiel still had had enough decorum to thank their host properly and accept the plate with coffee and snacks. Uriel put his coffee cup on the table with a loud sound and Castiel rolled his eyes upwards just to be met with the expected stare. He hadn't quite foreseen the slight edge of worry pulling at the corners of Uriel's mouth, but soon it was distracted by a little sandwich and Castiel breathed a small sigh of relief to at least be spared his concern.
"Way to ruin a manly moment, Benny," Dean complained, but broke out in laughter after Benny started chuckling. Things were still bleak, but at least he wouldn't be alone.
century?" Dean asked incredulously and then he wiped his hand over his face, shaking his head. Castiel didn't react much, letting Dean pace a bit, trying to figure out what to do. "Look, Cas," Dean finally said, turning back to him. "I'm from another time or another dimension or whatever. I'm not entirely sure where I'm now, but I'm from a place which… you haven't even discovered yet… But it's 2017 there."
"No it isn't. It's nice," Cas argued but Luke just heaved a sigh, putting his hands on his hips, studying the place with distaste.
Dean came back with keys a moment later, guiding Cas to their room. He wasn't sure why this brought new nerves to him. Dean dropped his bag on the table, closing the door and then sighing as he stretched. After that he studied Cas.
Dean was surprised that Cas hadn't said anything at all so far, but wordlessly followed the woman up two flights of stairs and down a corridor. She unlocked the room and flicked on the light, then she stepped back out.
He had talked to him some more over the last couple of days, even video chatted with him. Jack had been around then, insisting to say hi too. The kid was the spitting image of his dad, just with lighter hair and he was cheerful and easy-going in a way Dean hadn't expected of an 18-year-old. Admittedly, Dean didn't know a lot about kids that age. But the way Cas and Jack interacted did unlock an unsettling kind of longing for family inside him.
"I'm not sure I find your attitude uplifting considering you lead us into this battle," Lady Bevell said and Dean knew not to take offense. Eventually she heaved an uncharacteristically dramatic sigh.
Regret pooled inside of Cas, when he thought about a future in which Dean would return half his heart. Though of course, Cas had to remind himself not to think of it this way. It was for the best that Dean could return to his life, his court and his duties, to find a wife and have children if he so desired. Castiel's fate was elsewhere. He was a Seraph and he would continue to watch over humans for millennia to come. His feelings were irrelevant and if the people around him were to be believed, they would fade eventually. But for now, they were present and they were strong and Castiel longed to go home.
"Angelic biology isn't quite the same as yours," she told him, "we are complex, long-lived creatures. I assumed Cas to be prudent. However, he has surprised me before where it concerned you. So I wanted to be certain that there wouldn't be any… additional surprises."
"Maybe the witch forgot and won't come to collect at all," John argued. Mary shot him an incredulous look.
"Right. Indeed. I followed your suggestion to write a letter to Michael and I think he really liked that," John said.
"I should have perished a long time ago… I've only been living on borrowed time… I wanted to die for so long and you gave me something special, an enjoyment for life that I hadn't known before."
"So… Your mom's gone," he started, then he pulled his hand up, fingers digging into the fabric of his shirt and pulling it out of his trousers.
"I've got a hard time believing that, but fine. Let's summon that son of a bitch," he said with a cocky grin and his gun still in hand. Just in case. Castiel threw him an unimpressed look, then he turned towards the door and not towards the fireplace as Dean has suspected.
"When Sam was only half a year old, a witch fed Sam demon blood. It was a curse given in exchange for a favor Mary had asked of the witch ten years prior," he explained. "Your mother was left with the choice of how to deal with the challenge the witch had presented her with."
"We merely had a disagreement about investigating Ketch's information. There's some clues we could follow, but he wants to wait and see I guess." That got Charlie's attention.
"He's an alpha." The woman squinted at him and Cas read her scent as disapproving. It was still weird to him how he could read disapproval out of the slightly spicy scent coming off her. He guessed this was simply natural, even though it was bizarre.
"Slightly exaggerated, isn't it? I know my own dick pretty well," Dean said and somehow the god must have taken it as a challenge, because he made a motion to pull up the skirt and unbind the strings of his leggings.
"I don't know. It's kind of a big topic," Dean admitted. "I'd like to have kids, but if you don't then I won't push for it. I'd rather have you." Cas smiled at him. "But… uh… do you? Want kids? More kids I mean?"
"Can you send me back?" he asked in probably not quite grammatically correct Latin. Chuck stopped his fidgeting and stared at Dean, at least this time not like Dean was a raving madman. "Come on, Chuck! What am I doing here?" The Latin didn't really seem to help, because Chuck continued to look bewildered by Dean's questions. His gaze dropped down to the many bottles of wine he carried, as if he was wondering if he was drunk and imagining this all. Dean wondered the same the longer this continued on. Time to change tracks.
"And uh… protection is also very important," Dean added, remembering Cas' text message. "Make sure to always use protection even if she says she doesn't want it. Believe me,
"Thank you, Benny…" he said, then he heaved a sigh. "To be honest I don't know what to do. I didn't want Cas to know and I don't actually want to… to hurt him or whatever. I agree with mom that it serves no one if he's actually vulnerable, because like it or not we rely on him here. We also rely on his goodwill…"
"They're good," Dean commented almost shyly and Cas was still dazed enough to have nothing to offer but a soft "huh?". Dean pointed his fork to the pancakes, grinning now. "Best pancakes ever." Castiel severely doubted that but at least it meant the magic had Dean in its hold, making him receptive to everything that Cas said or did.
"Luckily I don't need your consent to take you if you don't agree to unleash your powers," Asmodeus informed him pleasantly.
"Sure," Sam said and for quite a while they were silent, Dean simply enjoying knowing that he was back with his family, where he belonged. Until Sam spoke again: "So, I met Castiel and Jack."
“Your child blew me up!” the Shadow shouted, the borrowed voice almost making Cas jump. “He woke up every other bastard in here! It’s LOUD!” The shadow madly wagged its finger at Cas. “And do you know what happens when God decides to destroy an entire network of worlds?” Castiel frowned at the shadow, but it wasn’t particularly interested in Cas’ input anyway. “They all land here! And usually that’s fine but now there’s too much of it! The Empty is bursting at the seams!” the Shadow ranted. It waved its hand. “Metaphorically speaking.”
