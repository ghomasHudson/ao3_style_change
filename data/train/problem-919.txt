It was such a joy to see John thrive in the following weeks. Opulent epicurean meals crowned with most exquisite desserts, daily walks, and untroubled sleep erased most of the worry lines from his dear face. Nightmares troubled us less frequently, and our melancholy episodes were easier to handle. My craving for drugs was gradually fading away.
After dinner we lounged on the sofa in the gun-room while the Colonel paced about, recounting to us one of his hunting experiences in India. Sherlock listened politely, but I saw that his mind was on something else. He met my gaze and took my hand in his, an apologetic expression in his eyes. I smiled to reassure him. For someone amazingly astute sometimes he can be rather obtuse about things which constitute a relationship. It’s not really his fault: he had been very lonely for most of his life until we met.
He snatched the vaseline jar from the bedside table and slickened himself thoroughly. I had expected him to enter me slowly and carefully, as was his wont, but suddenly he pushed all the way in with one swift motion which took my breath away. He knew he wasn’t hurting me. His thick girth stretched me, and the burning sensation made my toes curl. I gasped, but before I could recover, John started to pound into me. Each thrust was sending a wave after wave of pleasure which merged into an overwhelming tide. I bit my lip, trying not to moan aloud, but to no avail. Being taken so roughly and yet so lovingly reduced me to hoarse sobbing. My soldier was so keen to have me.
—This journal has been neglected of late. Ten weeks passed in an intense chase across Europe to untangle the schemes of Baron Maupertuis and to close down the infamous Netherland-Sumatra Company. Exposing numerous frauds and catching the Baron’s accomplices red-handed, Holmes worked with little regard for his health: fifteen hours a day and almost without breaks. It was quite a feat to cajole him into taking his rest occasionally when he was upon the Baron’s trail. At least I was able to take some of the load off his shoulders. However, at the critical moment, I had to leave his side. I was loath to do it, yet I was bound by a previous obligation. My patient, Mrs. Pamela Saunders, had a removal of a benign tumour scheduled. She was in the care of Dr. Davis, a finest surgeon, but had made me promise that I would be present.
I lingered in the bedroom, admiring the view. Vague hopes began to stir within my heart. We had been saving money for almost a decade, wishing for a country house where we could go for weekends. Recently Sherlock had cleared up a tangled abduction case which concerned a noble and very rich family, and the remuneration he had received was exceptional in its generosity.
I rented a small house in Queen Anne Street and furnished my consulting-room, making it as presentable as I could afford. With the additional expense of hiring a maid-of-all-work, my meals were frugal and my cupboard-like bedroom upstairs contained only an old creaky bed and a rickety washstand. I didn’t favour sleeping anyway, for every night I returned either to the caves or to the battlefield or both.
Having opened the windows and sent the maid for the charwoman, John heaved a weary sigh. Now that we were alone, his shoulders drooped. He started to shake slightly—echoes of Maiwand still affected him even after eleven years.
“Your condition is rather drastic,” John remarked as he gazed at me from head to foot, his eyes lingering on my crotch.
, etc., etc. pleaded with Sherlock for an interview or a commentary. He turned them all down, so instead reporters switched to me and then Mrs. Hudson, waiting whenever either of us showed at the door. It was one of the reasons I started contemplating a holiday in the country. The main reason was Sherlock’s well-being, however. Fresh air and some exercise would surely facilitate his convalescence if only a suitable place could be found. And soon an opportunity presented itself.
Also, Watson obviously knew that Holmes pretended that his ankle was sprained when they were fishing out information from Reuben Hayes.
“Could you send a word to your brother? Perhaps he can do something to spare her interrogations and such,” I whispered to Holmes.
“I don’t mean to,” Saville answered. “The clock is ticking. In five minutes we all shall be blown to pieces.”
I caressed him and whispered sweet nothings to relax him. It never ceases to amaze me how he craves simple touch, especially once his aloof veneer is cast off. Cast off were the clothes too, and we moved against each other naked, in every sense. His nervous tension melted away; I could feel that he gave himself wholly to pleasure as did I. There was no shadow of melancholy in his eyes when he reached the peak and I followed. I would follow him anywhere.
“Glad to hear it,” Holmes replied, his eyes glinting mischievously. “And cheer up, my dear boy. Did you really think I would allow anything,” he pressed my hand, “
Having finished with my ablutions, I took out the toy from the pocket of my dressing-gown, too impatient to go upstairs again. I slathered my entrance with vaseline, imagining John’s fingers. They teased my rim and pressed gently inside, first one, then another, stretching me and rubbing my prostate. My prick was at full stand, and I bit my lip to suppress a moan. I slickened the toy generously. In my imagination my dashing soldier unbuttoned his trousers and freed his gorgeous cock, already stiff and leaking for me. Its blunt tip carefully pushed in. My pliant entrance welcomed the full girth—
Of all the things which I had encountered over the past three years, finding him in this state was the worst. Bluish veins stood out on his forehead, and his breath fluttered, the rise of his chest barely noticeable. Could it be that I had kept him safe from Moriarty, but he would be snatched away from me by illness?
The day went on uneventfully; none of my patients mentioned Holmes even in passing, making it seem as if he didn’t exist at all and had never appeared in my surgery. Holmes stayed upstairs the whole day, and we saw each other only in the evening, after I had closed up. Changing Holmes’s bandages, I was glad to observe that his wounds were healing steadily.
I declined an offer to be brought back in the carriage, for I needed to process the news in solitude. I walked to the village slowly. It is impossible to describe how profound my joy and relief were. Sherlock was alive. He was out there, somewhere.
We ordered the cabby to drive us to Northumberland Avenue instead and soon were at the entrance of a magnificent building designed in the Italian Classic style. A truly epicurean establishment, inside it was as luxurious as outside, with its lofty halls, marble fountains, and low, ornate sofas. Whenever Watson and I wished to indulge our senses, that was the place.
I turned around. There was such remorse in his eyes that my heart clenched. At that moment he was not a triumphant detective, a grown and formidable man, but a scared boy.
“Ah, the case,” he said, puffing out blue rings of smoke. “We are to investigate a century-old farmhouse, my dear Watson. You’ll see for yourself when we arrive.”
It’s considered to be one of extra-canonical Holmes stories by ACD, where Holmes is referenced indirectly, but it’s never stated that it’s him. The theory he suggests eventually proves erroneous, yet since he didn’t participate in the investigation per se and only speculated over what was known to the press, it can hardly be counted against him.
And lastly, this famous part where Holmes appoints Watson as the jury, again speaks volumes of the respect Holmes has for Watson (not to mention how romantic it is to reunite lovers out of one’s own code of honour rather than abiding the law):
“I want to leave here,” he said, his voice catching a little. “I can’t stand this place any longer. I want to go home.”
Walking up to him, I considered dropping to my knees at his feet again and applying my mouth to the delectable arse of his. It would be a treat to lick and suck him loose until he begged for my cock. But I could barely contain myself. That kind of a prelude had to be postponed for another time. I craved to fuck him at once.
Back at John's practice, the maid told me that the doctor had returned five minutes ago. My heart was pounding as she ushered me into a spacious, comfortably furnished consulting-room. John was sitting at his desk with a frown of confusion upon his pallid features.
By the next morning he had improved considerably—he could sit up and eat unassisted—so that it seemed that he had an iron constitution. He was well enough for morning ablutions and a change of clothes. Mine were somewhat short for him, but that would have to do until Martha had laundered and mended his.
I felt utterly crushed. My quest, my nearly-accomplished goal—all of it seemed to have lost its meaning. I sent inquiries to Mycroft at once. Was John all right? Or… perhaps he was weary of the long wait? Had he met someone else? According to the reports, nothing was amiss. But was Mycroft telling me the truth? I was deeply engaged in my covert work in America and had no way to check.
I agreed, intending to hand over the patient to the family physician afterwards, as professional etiquette required. Mrs. Hudson was already trotting up with my medical bag. I nodded my thanks, and off we were in an instant, rattling towards a magnificent estate which was looming in the distance.
An arrangement which would be quite common for married couples, and also a nod to Watson’s gambling issue.
“We have many more of them, sir. Congratulations keep coming, but Mr. Holmes wished not to be disturbed,” whispered the hotel attendant before leaving.
The plea in his eyes cut me to the quick. His request wasn’t a courteous dismissal. He meant what he said, and I could only nod. Had I been that detached reasoner whose veneer I strove to maintain, it would all have been much easier. Logically I agreed that neither of us was in good shape, but logic couldn’t prevent my spirits from plummeting. Worse still, John felt guilty, no matter how many times I told him it was not his fault.
Reading page after page of John’s recollections, I could see that he had concealed nothing. He was brutally honest, just as I wanted him to be. Paper was the medium which had helped him to express the pain I had inflicted on him, and I hoped that this way it wouldn’t fester in his soul. I needed to know what he had endured at my hands.
“A message for you, sir, from that gent over there,” the boy said, pointing at the passing four-wheeler behind which Parker was perched on the footboard, sneering. “You prevented this mishap, but what about the other?”
. It was noted many times that Watson is quite observant himself, and having lived with Holmes for years he learned and continued to cultivate his faculties. So he easily deduces that Holmes has a case when he finds Holmes in good spirits at breakfast in spite of the gloomy weather. However, further on Holmes admits that he in turn is influenced by Watson’s ways:
“Why would you do such a stupid thing as falling in love again? The first time—with that university fellow—didn’t teach you a thing.”
, Doctor,” he said. “It was a rather rash step. Fortunately, it didn’t aggravate the situation, but I’m relieved that this time you had enough sense to consult me first.”
“These parts are peaceful and beautiful. When I first came here, I realised I needed exactly this after the war,” said the Colonel.
I had given Lestrade all leads to Jelland’s clandestine money-printing workshop, so one chilly night in the beginning of April the police raided it and arrested everyone there, including Jelland himself. When the handcuffs clicked on Jelland’s wrists, his usual poise was gone and his cadaverous, pointed face was contorted in impotent rage.
“He’s a bachelor, and apart from the trusty servants, there is no one else in the house,” I explained soothingly. “And he knows about us. He himself happens to have been involved with men.”
“Let me think. The attic won’t do for the same reason. Ah, there’s a small larder in the kitchen. Perhaps they won’t even notice it?”
My sources reported that Watson was a decent if somewhat disorganised individual, an offspring of impoverished Edinburgh gentlefolk, an impecunious doctor who had been driven to seek his fortune in the army. After being invalided out, he gambled and often lived beyond his means, but otherwise was quite harmless.
“Yes, I was too dazed and blurted it out instead of my alias,” Holmes said sheepishly. “Or perhaps I felt from the very beginning that I could trust you. Of course you have only my word for everything I’ve told you. It’s understandable if you choose not to believe me.”
“Doctor, Mr. Holmes, welcome,” said he. “Mr. Holmes, it’s such a pleasure to meet you. I’ve heard a lot about you from Watson, and, of course, your recent success is most impressive.”
I took Sherlock’s hand into mine as we gazed at the sea. It was wonderful. We could be ourselves here in the open, without fear. He pressed my hand, sharing the sentiment. We chose one of the swimming-pools, undressed to the drawers, and plunged into the cool, refreshing water.
I agreed eagerly. He must have contemplated every possibility and arrived at the conclusion that there was no better course of action than to step away from the problem for a while.
As I entered the den, I nearly choked on the foul opioid miasma permeating it. There were rows and rows of bunk beds filled with detritus which once used to be people. Passing between the beds, I peered into sallow faces in search of the familiar dear features, but it seemed in vain. Then a hand shot out from one of the bunks and pulled at the skirts of my coat. I recognized that thin, chiselled wrist, and when our eyes met, it was all I could do not to cry out in joy. Behind the grime on his face and a false bushy beard Holmes was grinning at me.
4. Here’s another evidence of how Watson is essential for Holmes’s thinking process. He’s like a catalyst—Holmes feels at ease and untroubled when his Watson is at his side, and it helps his brain to work more efficiently.
There was a glimpse of Holmes’s heart, a crack in the marble, as Jeremy Brett called it, and then Holmes retreats behind his shield of humour and cynicism. The point he makes is so true—they’re both crazy in a sense, because there’s no limit for him, and his Watson will follow him headlong into any mad endeavour to keep him safe.
“I was sure I could handle it, although my friends and relatives warned me against it. I know now that they were right. No one in their right mind should join Her Majesty's troops.”
“Oh, I didn’t mean to offend you, my dear fellow. Of course you wouldn’t have. You tried to hide me from the Special Division, for God’s sake.”
Sherlock went to the window and pulled up the blind with a theatrical flourish. I gasped quietly. The vista of the Channel was stunning—the great expanse of the sea framed by the sharp ridges of the cliffs and the boundless sky which is forever hidden in the city behind walls and roofs.
. As a result, Sherlock dropped out of the university as well and would have followed his former lover abroad, had the said lover explicitly asked him not to.
“That is Fulworth, the closest village, two miles from here,” Sherlock gestured to the east where in a hollow by the bay a small settlement sat in a semicircle of cheerful houses. “We can dine in the pub there after bathing. And the estate over there is called The Gables,” he pointed at the grand Tudor mansion about half a mile from us. “It is owned by one Harold Stackhurst, a local squire, and was turned into a coaching establishment five years ago.”
I think Watson’s devotion to Holmes is based more on respect than on hero-worship as seems to be the case with Bunny. Watson has some influence on Holmes: he weaned Holmes from cocaine and he can take Holmes down a peg or two when Holmes gets too insufferable. Bunny is so smitten that he is ready to forgive anything, even being handled in a most cavalier way. In the very beginning Bunny needs Raffles to get out of the trouble, to shift the weight from his shoulders, and threatening to commit suicide if refused would have been downright extortion had it not been a man like Raffles. Watson deals with his troubles on his own and helps Holmes to fight Holmes’s demons. Sorry if the comparison looks unfavourable, but this is the impression I get after the first book of the Raffles series.
Yet physical qualities alone would not have been enough to capture Sherlock. Watson might not possess a particularly sharp mind, but he was quite bright, brighter than an average person. He was delighted, even awed, to meet me because I was Sherlock’s brother. It was amusing to see his astonishment at the differences between Sherlock and myself. He hung on Sherlock’s every word, taking copious notes, and during the investigation itself proved to be a good helpmate to Sherlock. No wonder Sherlock had become so emotionally invested in him.
“You will just walk and talk with him,” Holmes replied impassively. “I’ll meet you both at the right time. That will incriminate him, and he’ll have to give the letters back.”
My curt reply made John wince. He gave me an anxious glance and put his hand over mine under the table.
I just chuckled. Our therapeutic measures had proved most effective, for there was no stiffness left in any part of his body whatsoever. My symptoms of cold had been nipped in the bud.
Whenever Holmes waxes uncharacteristically poetic we can’t take it as is because there was a disclaimer from Watson: “
to Watson for his sudden compulsion. Contrary to the popularised image, Holmes of the canon is actually a nice and polite person (despite being curt sometimes). First and foremost, he respects his Watson.
In the Granada adaptation “my friend and colleague” is something of a standard introduction of Watson made by Holmes to anyone. Here it is in the Canon:
My resolve crumbled. Desperate to have him at that very instant, I removed my fingers from his arse and released his cock from my mouth. Neither of us had patience for a slow entry; I slickened myself up hurriedly and shoved my prick into his hole. He let out a low, sensuous groan as I filled him—I was fully inside him at a single push, deep in his tight, hot arse. I began to fuck him in earnest immediately, and with each thrust he kept saying my name like a mantra. He embraced me with his legs as I was slamming into him and we were kissing hungrily. Our bodies thus intertwined, we fucked in a frenzy, panting and moaning, our heartbeats wild. Our passion was consuming us, and we went on and on, having lost track of time. When we finally paused to draw breath, the mindless lust had burned out, and what remained in its wake was endless tenderness. I looked into his eyes; their colour was of the stormy sky. There was none of that habitual sharp austerity about his beloved features. Instead, they were soft and glowing as he was gazing back at me. He stroked my cheek, and my heart was overflowing. I have never loved and been loved like that.
Such themes as their partnership, Holmes’s empathy, and Watson’s perceptiveness can be found literally in every story/novel of the Canon. In this one Holmes says to Huxtable,
“Pray do so tonight,” I said, grinning in anticipation. Soon the solution would be in our hands. It was a sheer pleasure to untangle that little conundrum.
“He loves you and cares for you, why do you not see it? Mend your fences while you still can. It is much better than estrangement, believe me.”
There’s also evidence in this story that Watson knows way more than he leads the reader to believe. Together with Holmes he witnesses Duke’s arrival to the inn, but keeps the reader in the dark, as if he himself didn’t realise. But when Holmes confronts the Duke, the Duke asks,
“Everything will be arranged for you,” his brother replied. “Now, the certificate, if you please, Doctor.”
Later that day, at Hamleys, Holmes played Father Christmas again as an encore, much to all of the children’s delight, including the Irregulars. Every child was presented with a splendid toy, and it was wonderful to see their joyous, glowing faces, untroubled by hardships at least for a while.
“Even though I asked you not to publish new stories for now, do write, John. I treasure your works in spite of my quibbling. Your readers are looking forward to them, and the ripe time will come.”
“Thank you, Mrs. Langley. Without your help we wouldn’t have been able to do that,” Holmes said cordially. “Please accept this as a token of our gratitude.”
My heart racing, I gave him a sovereign. The boy scurried away with a gleeful shriek, and I jumped to my feet. Having no idea where Upper Swandam Lane was, I hailed a cab. It turned out to be not very far, a vile alley behind the wharves full of drunken sailors and streetwalkers even in the morning. My destination was an opium den of the lowliest kind, a real cesspit for the worst dregs of society.
She sniffed and smiled, clearly trying not to cry. It cut my heart to pieces and I felt like a traitor, but I had to stay silent and deny her the comfort of the truth.
“Exactly. Nevertheless, the message contained all the necessary information: the figurine had a label from Hamleys which answered the question of the place.”
The race was an unfair one, for the black carriage had two horses, and it was always quicker, catching up with us at every turn. With the break of dawn morning traffic started to fill the streets and get in the way. I thought it was sheer madness when Holmes took a collision course with a water cart at the crossroads near St. George-in-the-East, but it proved to be a neat calculation. He laughed out loud as the water cart blocked the passage for our pursuer. That bought us some time, and we rushed on, past a herd of cattle which was being led to the butcher’s.
“It is probably for the better, Doctor,” she said, seeing me off. “Putting some distance between your new lodgings and Baker Street is wise. It takes time to cope. But please come visit me if you can, for I shall miss you.”
John stared at me indignantly, having understood at once that I intended to continue the travel under my real identity, acting as bait.
That deep baritone pierced me like an electric charge. I would know its cadence, its gentle, almost imperceptible Edinburgh lilt amongst millions. I had been hearing it in my dreams for three years.
The Cubitts had a similar approach to personal boundaries in the relationship as Holmes and Watson do. When Holmes points out to Mr. Cubitt that “
from the floor, ignoring a vicious stab of pain in my temples. It is not worth quoting here what Colonel Moriarty wrote. His shameless lies and outrageous distortion of facts fill me with disgust to this day. My mind cleared even as I was halfway through. A refutation was in order. I sat at my desk immediately. Seldom had words flown so swiftly from under my pen—memories which I had striven to drown in alcohol flashed before my eyes in sharpest detail. In less than two hours I had finished.
As soon as the idea had crossed my mind, I felt someone’s presence behind me and turned around. Moriarty stood on the path, barring my way of retreat.
.” I mean, really, woman? Even if you didn’t know the circumstances connected to the paper, it was a no-brainer to surmise that the impact it could make was far more terrible than your love letter.
He embraced me fiercely and kissed my nape. He was right: we could benefit from a few hours of distraction. Having finished with our ablutions, we ascended to the bedroom and gave free rein to our desires. As soon as we got between the sheets, I was on my back, and he took me again and again during the night. Then, curled into him, I slept like I hadn’t done for a long while.
“I am not leaving you,” I whispered between the kisses, echoing his words in a Strasbourg hotel three years ago. “Ever.”
Mrs. Hudson came up to the sitting-room, beaming, and asked for directions as to what she should prepare for a celebratory dinner.
One thing occurred to me in the moment. I had rarely, if ever, told John I loved him. For some irrational reason I had been afraid that if I did so, we would part. And there I was, standing on the edge of an abyss, resigned that I had probably seen him for the last time in this life. How foolish I had been.
My heart sank. If he used that code phrase which referred to my medical bag, his condition must have been serious enough to have raised his own concerns. I barely slept a wink on the night train, wondering about the state he was in. A strong reaction was upon him, no doubt, coupled with physical and nervous exhaustion.
Three precious days had been lost. I shouldn’t have left in the first place or I wouldn’t have missed the onset of Holmes’s symptoms. Over the recent weeks I had witnessed far too often how quickly people succumbed if treatment was delayed and even when it was duly provided. But Sherlock had an iron constitution. He was strong. He would fight.
,” Stamford whispered back. “It chased him relentlessly, and he was dodging it like a rabbit hunted by a fox. He had almost escaped when it hit him as it swept by. The blow was so strong it flung him several yards aside.”
“You scream in your sleep. I could hear you upstairs,” Holmes said. “You have a military precision about you, and your limp is distinctive: the touch of an Old One. Your suntan hasn’t completely faded yet which means that you returned only a few months ago. And where was the most recent war? In Afghanistan.”
“Aren’t you too?” his hand slid down and squeezed my hardening prick through the clothes. “The Norwood case left me out of sorts, and I hadn’t been inclined during it. Whereas you are regular in your habits.”
The pounding rhythm of our hearts abated a little. I trailed kisses along Sherlock’s neck and nuzzled his armpit, making him giggle, for he was ticklish there. His heady scent sent shivers down my spine, my prick becoming even harder inside him. I resumed the thrusts, and at this new angle I was hitting Sherlock’s sweet spot with precision. He threw back his head, panting and stifling his moans. His channel clenched around me, its pressure so exquisite that an oath tumbled from my lips before I knew it. We kissed again, drunk on each other, both close to the crisis. Sherlock carded his fingers through my hair, whispering my name. His face was glowing. I caught his hand and pressed my lips to his thin wrist, then to his sharp knuckles and long, nervous fingers. I wished to fulfill my promise and bring him to a most decadent climax which would make his toes curl. He read the intent in my eyes. When I sat up, he turned fully onto his side so that I could lie behind him.
“Then I shan’t beat about the bush, Dr. Watson,” I said. “What are your intentions with my brother? If this is some sort of a temporary arrangement for you, you must desist at once.”
And finally, to Holmes’s uncharacteristic mercantilism. He ostentatiously reminds the Duke of the promised reward. I think it’s his way of showing the Duke how repulsed he is with the Duke’s conduct. Holmes is
In the beginning Holmes is all anticipation. Also, one of the instances of Holmes coming to Watson’s bedroom:
Holmes always does what he can to help those who are vulnerable. He doesn’t stand by and watch when there’s an injustice being done and sees clearly through Gibson’s lies. Gibson comparing him with
Nevertheless, I kept an eye on him. Surprisingly, little by little he gained a reputation as a capable professional. I realised that not all was lost yet: he could make his way in the world and with due handling could be useful to our country and, consequently, to my own career. Solving cases which I directed to him proved to be beneficial for both of us.
What if Holmes’s aim in writing this story wasn’t showcasing his deduction powers? Watson already did that for him many times before. What if this story was written indeed as a love letter to Watson, because that case would certainly appeal to Watson’s romantic tastes? Suppose for some reason Watson couldn’t accompany Holmes at the time, and years later, in their Sussex retirement, Holmes wrote it to please his Watson?
Which, as many pointed out before, can be interpreted in more ways than one. If we look between the lines, the truth is right there, concealed, but not that much.
“About ‘A Study’...” he replied after some silence. “I thought my suggestions would be helpful and got carried away.”
. It’s also a curious point whether Holmes and Watson still live at Baker Street at the time of this story or whether it was one of those rare cases Holmes took on in the retirement. There is
He’s practically having a panic attack while the poor Lady Frances is being taken out of the coffin and revived. So much for a cold logician.
Holmes NEEDS his Watson to work more efficiently. He thinks aloud in Watson’s presence and it helps—Watson’s reactions facilitate Holmes’s process of reasoning.
, a medium which could reach Sherlock even abroad, but before publishing the story it was vital to test whether my method wasn’t a failure. I appealed for help of the most perceptive reader that came to mind.
The man who walked into my consulting-room was striking in appearance: tall, heavily built, with an authoritative air about him, he was like a mountain towering over lowlands—that is, us, mere mortals—although his anatomy suggested that he wasn’t of royal bloodline. His steely grey eyes seemed to pierce through you to see your innermost thoughts.
“I am glad that the extended vacation in the country proved so refreshing for you both,” he remarked after the dessert. “Now that you are back in the city, are you ready to resume your service, Sherlock?”
“But I am such a coward,” Mrs. Langley replied, blushing and shaking her head. “I was so afraid for my own life that I couldn’t bring myself to come to Baker Street and left those vague cues instead.”
John and I exchanged glances; with a soft smile John brought a chair next to my armchair, and we seated ourselves.
I started to move within him, very gently at first, dragging my cock along his clenching channel and feeling him open for me. His eyes closed, he was biting his lips, low moans escaping them. I tightened my grip on his cock and frigged him as I was increasing my pace. As much as I loved being taken by my John, I loved to be inside him. It gave him such intense pleasure that he would let go of his composure; his subconscious defenses would fall apart. He always submitted himself to me, unashamed of how needy and vulnerable he was. Every single time I was humbled by the utmost trust he put in me.
I pondered the matter over and came to a conclusion that a direct approach would be best. It was necessary to have a conversation with Dr. Watson. He seemed a sensible fellow, and I needed to check whether he realised how serious the state of affairs was.
During the first year of their cohabitation Sherlock’s affections seemed unrequited. I hoped that in due course Sherlock would get over his infatuation. Aside from it, the doctor’s company had a positive effect on him: his drug use diminished while his enthusiasm to establish himself as a criminal agent doubled, since he strived to impress the doctor.
I couldn’t find an answer. It was true that one had to watch one’s every word and deed lest there be the tiniest reason for being reported to the authorities. Sometimes even being an exemplary citizen could end badly if you were too successful or too bright. Living quietly was the best way to avoid envy and slander. A quiet life had its simple joys like eating an ice-cream on a sunny day or watching a music hall performance. Throwing away your life for an idea? I had had enough of that.
That night, I did all I could to fool them. The gang tried to burn down the Baker Street flat, thinking that I was at home, asleep. By morning the incident was in every paper and there was just enough time to depart. True to his word, Mycroft had accompanied John in a carriage provided by the government. It took John several minutes to recognise me in my disguise of an elderly Italian priest. He didn’t turn a hair, and together we put on a nice show of misunderstanding in front of a porter. Moriarty’s henchmen arrived when the train was already moving. And yet, I couldn’t shake the feeling that the Professor himself was probably on his way to the Continent as well. The news of the arson attack on our Baker Street rooms appalled John, but I assured him that Mycroft would deal with the matter and Mrs. Hudson wouldn’t bear any expenses.
By the time I felt rested, Moran must have departed. Soon John would return, and I knew I wouldn’t be able to sit there and watch him grieve—I would give myself away, which would be a death warrant for us both. So I took to my heels.
Right. Since we were perfectly alone, there was no need for the obligatory precaution of calling each other by our surnames. But the place was unfamiliar, and the habit had grown indelible over the years.

nekosmuse doubts that the story was written by Holmes at all, due to style similarities with Watson’s writing and the fact that the case is quite simple to demonstrate Holmes’s powers. However, the narrator doesn’t wax poetic here and there, like in LION. On the contrary, the style is quite sharp and precise. He tells story from the beginning, unlike Watson, who tended to start from the middle, as Holmes often pointed out. He sings his praises to Watson throughout the whole text, which would be totally out of character if Watson were the real author (e.g. Watson is hardly mentioned in LION, which is way more similar to Watson’s style).
We paid and were ushered past the main staircase and a crowded lounge to a secluded wing with private suites. Fortunately, the one which we always engaged wasn’t occupied. A rich scent of sandalwood, cypress, and musk permeated the air of the cosy, semi-dark cooling-room where we had reposed on many occasions, wearied by an eventful day or when we desired a distraction from commonplaces of existence. Having removed our boots by the door, we stepped onto the thick carpet which was a joy to our tired feet. Watson closed his eyes for a moment, relishing the sensation of softness. We took off our hats and coats, hung them on the rack, and put our valuables, including Watson’s pistol, into the safe beside it. Watson dropped onto the opulent Eastern divan and stretched his legs with a sigh.
). Those scholars argued that it was too cold in winter to go out on dates, so they were meeting in Agatha’s room. How about pubs and cafes? How about Holmes’s personal code of honour? Holmes plainly states that they went out and just talked, and even that made him uncomfortable:
“So be it,” I said, removing his dressing-gown and letting it drop on the floor. “I shan’t fuck you; I shall make love to you.”
”—that’s about the readers, unless Watson uses the royal “we”. Holmes’s reason for taking on this mission (which the narrator wants us to believe to be a singular instance rather than one of many) is also quite unconvincing. Holmes agreed because the Foreign Minister and the Prime Minister asked him? In
Watson’s foray into writing proved to be an unexpected and curious turn. Apparently, he wished to do justice to Sherlock, who was never credited either by the press or the police, so he penned a novel about my brother. The novel was of a sensational variety, lacking a systematic approach and waxing poetic far more often than advisable. Sherlock complained and grumbled but couldn’t deceive me: he was pleased. The novel attracted much attention among our acquaintances even if it wasn’t a success among the general public.
I had enough time to study him, sitting by his side. He was definitely not a common criminal: his impeccable haircut, the natural paleness of his complexion, his clean shaven cheeks, all bespoke a gentleman. There was nobility in his strong-set, aquiline features, even though he wasn’t conventionally handsome. His chin had the prominence and squareness which mark the man of determination. He was lean, all sinew and muscle like a whippet, with long limbs and a graceful build. During the initial examination, I had noticed puncture marks along his arms—a morphinist or cocainist, no doubt. Perhaps that was the reason he was pursued. He had the hands of an artist, with thin, chiselled fingers. Those fingers were blotted with ink and stained with chemicals. Was he an apothecary whose dispensary was involved in unlawful activities? That still didn’t explain why a black carriage had been after him, rather than the police.
The exultation from our reunion had faded. John found me lying on the settee, drained of all energy and unable to speak. It distressed him terribly. He said he regretted writing his account, which he immediately snatched from my hands and tore to pieces. To what avail? Every word of it was etched in my memory.
Sharing a vigil together made us reminiscent of the old days, but we hardly spoke, watching the street and listening to every sound within the reaches of the empty house. We were glad to observe plain-clothes policemen in an ambush nearby, which meant that Lestrade had paid heed to my call. John had brought a whistle with him to give the police a signal when the moment would be ripe.
After dinner I left a note to Lestrade should he come for Moran’s bullet which Mrs. Hudson had recovered. John wrote a letter to his colleague asking him to take over his practice for a while and sent for a change of clothes. Then we retreated upstairs to continue a feast of another kind. Yearning for each other mentally and physically, we couldn’t be sated until utter exhaustion had claimed us.
I was a bit surprised by his using my Christian name in front of an outsider. We usually reserve such intimacy for our home where there’s no one else except our household. But since the Colonel knew of our relationship, perhaps this precaution wasn’t necessary.
“Rest has done you a world of good, my dear boy,” Mycroft remarked, settling himself down in John’s armchair unceremoniously. “Your withdrawal syndrome has passed, I trust?”
No reply followed, and the connection was terminated. In a sense I was glad: the Professor was the kind of a man whose word wasn’t to be doubted. If he said he would leave John alone, so it would be. Although I wouldn’t hesitate to give my life for John’s safety, I wasn’t keen on dying—it would break John’s heart. Being proud of his ancient lineage, Moriarty was fond of old-fashioned ways. Most likely, he would arrange a rendezvous indeed quite similar to a duel, but away from onlookers. I would have to improvise on the spot. Alas, the odds would be not in my favour.
” which no one thought to suspect as his base. So why “a retired beekeeper” couldn’t be Holmes’s cover? (Until he really retired and continued to keep bees).
Having battled with Sherlock’s affliction for years, I wouldn’t touch morphine. The spirit case in the corner would serve the purpose. Something stronger than brandy would be necessary. I poured myself a full glass of whisky, not bothering to add soda into it. My throat burned; the heat spreading in my stomach was bringing no relief. I drank more and more whisky, vaguely aware of a salty tang upon my lips. My face was wet. I drank until the bottle slipped from my limp fingers and rattled on the floor, empty. The room swam in front of my eyes. Heavy lassitude crashed down on me. I welcomed it, falling into the darkness, an abyss of my own from which I did not wish to return.
John’s photographs in the newspapers had not prepared me for the way his appearance had changed. He was worn and thin, as thin as he had been after Afghanistan. His waxen, sickly complexion bespoke overwork and sleepless nights. His hair had gone grey at the temples. His lacklustre eyes gazed into mine without recognition as he handed me my books.
(1892), about two clerks, Jelland and McEvoy, who gambled away their means and then the money of their company. Jelland is the leader and McEvoy (whose name is Willy, btw) was “
Four hours which we spent crouching in the shrubbery, exposed to the icy drizzle and the biting March wind, left us drenched and chilled to the bone. Eventually our quarry walked directly into our ambush, and we apprehended Jack Brocket, one of the vilest swindlers I have encountered during my career. Lestrade drove off pleased with himself, since he would get all the credit, of course. For me a successfully concluded case is a reward in itself, and Watson never complains of inconveniences association with me causes him. As always, his help proved invaluable. I was aware yet again how fortunate I was to have him by my side. But it was easy to observe that exhaustion was taking its toll on my Watson: he was pressing his stiff left arm to his body unconsciously, and his tread was uneven, although he was trying his best to keep it steady. Before accompanying me, he had worked a full day in his surgery, and thus his energy was quite depleted.
“My dear fellow, please accept my deepest condolences,” Jackson said earnestly. “You don’t look yourself, which is understandable. You’ve been friends with Mr. Holmes for so many years. I prescribe you rest for as long as you need. Take good care of yourself and resume the work when you are truly ready.”
221b was within walking distance from the police station, but evidently Lestrade wished to ensure that I stayed out of trouble, so he drove me home and handed me over to an appalled Mrs. Hudson. I ascended the stairs as they were conversing in hushed tones in Mrs. Hudson’s parlour.
The next day we explored the house and its grounds as well as the surrounding countryside. The butler provided us with keys to the gate, so we could come and go whenever we wished. It was a most peculiar place, completely devoid of people as if someone had ensured that there would be no accidental trespassers hunting for rabbits or wild berries. We didn’t meet a soul as we walked in the forest and nearby glades, but when we climbed a high hill, we managed to spot a neighboring estate at a considerable distance.
Sheathed in me completely, Sherlock paused so that I could adjust. I always enjoy beyond words being full of him. It doesn’t make me any less of a man, for loving without prejudice is by no means a weakness. Sherlock must have felt when I was ready—he started to move at a gentle pace, the languid, delicious drag of his member stretching me more. The hand with which he had guided his cock inside me slid forward and closed around my prick. He fucked and stroked me at the same rhythm, and I relinquished the last vestiges of composure, carried away by the flood of sensations. His pace quickened, becoming rougher and rougher; God, how I loved it. I was moaning at the top of my voice. His hips slapped my arse, his bollocks slamming against my hole, and he couldn’t focus on stroking me any longer. He just held me by the hips as he was fucking me sore. Jolts of white pleasure coursed through my entire body, almost making me sob. My stiff prick dangled, neglected, but I didn’t really need it to be touched, with Sherlock’s cock up my arse, hitting my sweet spot.
Alright, some say that Holmes wasn’t quite the same man after Reichenbach, and again, maybe from the Hiatus to the Return ACD changed his views on Holmes, but what about this?
“I suppose I’ll follow your advice and take some time off, since my consulting-room is a mess anyway,” John said with a dry chuckle.
It seems that the Granada adaptation went with a room with two beds scenario, with Holmes sitting on one bed and Watson going to sleep in the other:
The first draft was ready while Mrs. Hudson and I were still in Kent. Upon returning to London, I consulted my notes and diaries and did some minor editing. There was a new popular periodical called
I took out the morocco case and opened it. It contained a round gold bracelet, plain and thin, so as not to impede movement when worn. The date of our meeting was engraved upon its inner side. I leaned forward and, having reached for John’s left wrist, put the bracelet around it. The lock clicked; the bracelet slipped under his shirt cuff, invisible for the world yet there for us.
“Certainly. Lestrade shall be in ambush with us at Christmas after the store is closed for the night, and constables shall watch the exits.”
“But that’s not what really bothers you,” I observed, handing him a damp flannel so that he could remove his make-up.
The carriage slowed down and took another turn, leaving the main road. We drove on a narrow lane winding into an old, vast forest which seemed to have sprung from the pages of the Grimm fairy-tales. We saw no lights or other indications of village or settlement in the vicinity. John pressed himself closer to me, and I could feel how tense he was with anticipation. This was hardly one of our investigations, yet I too was intrigued.
Even though I paid him little heed, I did observe that he was tense after a day in his surgery and making his rounds in the foul weather. He had cast a few wistful glances at me over the pages of the novel in his hands. There was a pent-up restlessness within him which he was suppressing, forcing himself to sit still and make no noise. Once his hand strayed towards the area of his groin, but he checked the movement abruptly and gripped the armrest instead. At last he laid his novel aside, rose from his armchair, and bid me good-night.
My younger brother is a sensitive, volatile man despite his attempts to pass as a cold-headed reasoner. He yearns for affection and kindness he was deprived of, for our parents passed away when he was very young. We both learned the hard way how cruel the world could be.
Our sanctum sheltered him like a cocoon from the outside world, which kept talking about the arrest of Baron Maupertuis.
At times I wonder why he is prone to such outbursts of jealousy. Surely he trusts me, and I’ve given him no reason to doubt my love and fidelity. I never hide anything from him regarding the matter. Could this be his own insecurities in his heart of hearts?
Upon ascending the lofty staircase and crossing the hall, I saw a thin line of light under the door of the guest room assigned to us. Sherlock wasn’t sleeping. He lay curled on the bed and raised his head as I entered. A smile lit up his face, anxiety disappearing from his features. When I climbed into bed, he clutched me to himself and claimed my lips. His tongue ravished my mouth as we were divesting each other of the confining evening garments. He groaned and gasped, overly sensitive, rigid with tension. His pulse was beating frantically.
The slashiest story of them all is published in 1924. By that time Holmes is 70, and Watson several years older. As the mods suggested with PRIOR, perhaps Watson is a little less careful in hiding the extent of affection between Holmes and himself. Perhaps he even allows the reader to see it plainly on purpose since it can’t possibly do any harm anymore to the two gentlemen of the honoured old age, long in retirement. In many subtle ways Watson already told us how much Holmes cares about him (“
By the end of the month our condition had marginally improved. On the last day of April we were re-arranging our archives and John was glancing through his old notes. He had abandoned writing completely, including his diaries. Nonetheless, describing on paper everything he deemed important had helped him after Maiwand. It occurred to me that this method might work now, too. I asked him very gently if he would consider writing about the past three years for me. He didn’t give me any definite answer, but from that evening he diligently spent an hour each day at his desk, and on the fourth of May presented me with the result. The significance of the date didn’t escape me.
Having read this story, I remain as perplexed as I was after watching the episode of the TV series. This goes beyond being simply inspired. It’s a rip-off, and a bland one at that. The action, the tension, the excitement of CHAS are gone. It’s not as if Mrs. Christie couldn’t come up with original plots of her own—she could and did most successfully. If it’s a “form of flattery”, as E. W. Hornung put it in his dedication to ACD in
The constables lead Jelland away; Lestrade shook his head in exasperation. Bless him, his respect for the good doctor and myself would not allow him to even consider that the rumours might have a foundation. Up to this day rumours remain merely rumours. No one has any proof.
“The next day I obtained a boxing toy made at Hamleys and packed it with every precaution, but of course that wasn’t enough to throw you off the scent, Mr. Holmes. I left the box surreptitiously at the gymnasium and was about to draw the proprietor’s attention to it when by sheer chance you and Dr. Watson came yourselves.
My own howl woke me. At first I was disoriented and couldn’t understand where I was, but gradually I realised that I was sitting on the floor in Sherlock’s room, propped against the wardrobe. Hurried steps approached, accompanied by the rustle of a dress.
Thus the news about Holmes knocked the wind out of me. I was in the overfilled medical tent when the nurse said an agitated lady was asking for me. My heart leapt into my mouth at the sight of Mrs. Hudson pacing outside, short of breath and her hat askew.
indeed.” Mycroft wrinkled his nose. “You must not appear in public at all or you will be arrested one of these days. I shall make arrangements for you to have your honeymoon in the country.”
I went back into the house, to my consulting-room, where the stranger was sleeping on the couch. Waking up in an unknown place, his body hurting all over, would certainly give him a turn. I decided to sit with him and calm him when he woke up.
“Of course.” Neville smiled and glanced at one of his assistants who hurried off with the errand at once.
Quite remarkable continuity, isn’t it? ACD might forget that Mary Morstan was an orphan (or add this inconsistency on purpose), but it seems that he had a pretty clear view of Holmes as a man with a heart of gold right from the start. In the only video interview (1927) he calls Watson ‘stupid’ (which sounds as if it’s in jest rather than in earnest), while in BLAN (1926) he writes:
So passed another year and then another. I was resolved to wait for as long as it would take. Burying myself in work helped to ward off fruitless anxiety. When I went to sleep I would be entirely exhausted and thus unable to think.
“Stand back, stay where you are!” he yelled in a horrid, hoarse voice, thrusting out his thin hand in a forbidding gesture. “It’s not what you think. It’s a tropical disease. Contagious by touch! Highly contagious!”
And so Holmes and I are back at Baker Street. Holmes is going through the accumulated mail with fresh zeal, having already wired
The room seemed cooler now that we had ceased our exertions but we were too lazy to grasp a corner of the bedspread and drag it over ourselves. We’d made a complete mess of it; my fingers were sticky with Sherlock’s semen, yet it didn’t bother me. My hand rested on his now flaccid member. I gave it an affectionate stroke, and Sherlock chuckled contentedly. We were quite sated with our feast. I pressed small kisses to the juncture between Sherlock’s neck and shoulder. He stirred and then turned to me face-to-face, my cock finally slipping out of him. In this position we could kiss, though, which we did, thoroughly.
Having walked along the corridor past a half-empty drawing-room, a bedroom with a lonely bed-frame in it, then yet another empty room, we came to a second, larger bedroom which, thankfully, had everything in place.
“It’s me he is after and he won’t spend additional energy on the run. You have always deferred to my good judgement,” I insisted.
A gust of wind cleared the fog in front of us, and Holmes suddenly pulled at the reins, cursing. A few yards away a shadow emerged from the sidestreet. As we turned awkwardly in the confined space between the dingy buildings, I realised what it was: a black carriage. It must have waited in an ambush; had it not been for the wind, we would have driven right into its clutches. The next instant we were fleeing from it at all full speed our poor horse could muster. My heart was pounding in my throat, but I believed in Holmes’s skills and knowledge of the area. We were whizzing through arches, trampling across backyards, and squeezing into such narrow passages that our dogcart was groaning in protest.
“Doctor, it’s half-past eight,” Mrs. Hudson said in a soft voice. “We are to set out in an hour. Your breakfast is on the table and your suit is in your room.”
A side note: I saw some tumblr posts implying that Watson doesn’t know French. In this story we have a direct evidence that he is quite fluent when he spoke to the maid’s lover:
A brisk middle-aged fellow greeted us in the meeting-room. I don’t quite recall his name or appearance, except for the grating voice in which he read the will. Mycroft was to receive half of Sherlock’s worldly goods, and I the other half. It was a considerable sum. Sherlock and I had been saving for a country house where we could spend weekends in leisure. Now it was not to be. I didn’t need the money. I needed Sherlock back at my side.
“I see that certain subtle forces have been at work here,” Mycroft said, eyeing John from head to foot. “It’s a pity you allow your reason to be clouded by such things, Sherlock. I did hope that someday you would learn.”
“It was suggestive,” Holmes replied, lighting his pipe. “I wondered who could walk about in the gymnasium, in the streets, at the pub, and at the store absolutely unnoticed. Every person in the gymnasium is known to me, but who could be so inconspicuous? A servant. Somebody most people take for granted. My conjecture was confirmed when I saw not one but two familiar faces among the staff of the store. And then, to be absolutely sure, I visited Mrs. Langley and talked to her.”
My cajoling clearly had an effect, for the resolve in John’s eyes started to fade and his expression became uncertain. Two days ago he had commissioned me to look into the case of Colonel Warburton, his old acquaintance. The Colonel’s odd behaviour had perplexed Watson during the customary reunion of army pals, but there seemed to be a method to the Colonel’s madness. I had discovered that the problem stemmed from a conflict with one of his fellow officers, and the Colonel’s antics must have been an ingenious way of handling a nasty situation. To prove my theory I needed more specific data.
“Agreed. And since the nearest Turkish bath is miles away, we could have a small wooden hut built for the purpose.”
That day at the Reichenbach Fall was the worst day of my life. Staring into that abyss had been worse than lying drenched in my own blood on the battlefield of Maiwand. Evidence left no hope, but I couldn’t—and wouldn’t—accept the obvious conclusion. Twilight was darkening as I peered beyond the edge of the cliff, calling Sherlock’s name. I shouted until I was hoarse and my voice gave out. In a dreamlike state I wandered to the boulder against which Sherlock’s Alpine-stock was propped. There I found the cigarette-case and the note, his last farewell. I read the words, yet the meaning they conveyed was too monstrous. Time simply stopped. I was in a state of absolute prostration by the time Steiler the elder arrived with some other people, apparently having been worried by my sudden appearance and departure. I don’t remember much about being accompanied back to Meiringen, although I did ask for the local police and related to them what I knew. It was already too dark to commence an official investigation, so any undertakings were postponed till morning. I slept fitfully, hoping that it all would prove to be only a nightmare.
Plain-clothes men rushed in, and soon they were walking Saville out to a four-wheeler. I longed to hug Holmes but had to refrain from it. He gave me a gentle look, aware of my feelings.
John seated himself, dropped his valise by the armchair, and accepted the glass from me with a nod of thanks.
Holmes chuckled at my sceptical remark. It was already past noon, so I rang for lunch. Our modest meal was brightened by a conversation we had about travelling—sea-faring, mountaineering, and even aeronautics. Holmes hadn’t been to the Continent, yet his experience was impressive: in his student days he had sailed to the Arctic on a whaler, climbed the mountains of my dear Scotland, and constructed a balloon himself as an experiment. I had ventured abroad only when I had been in the army, but he listened to my accounts avidly.
The elder Holmes seemed to have already reconciled himself with the situation. Even in this his reason had prevailed. He took his leave, and I could only wonder what was going on in his soul.
The vaseline jar was already beside him on the bed. I stroked his back and trailed kisses down his spine and over his pert buttocks. Then I parted them and ran my thumb along his puckered entrance. It made him goose-fleshy; he had a catching of the breath and shifted closer towards me.
, it’s very easy to imagine that Holmes and Watson decided to try their luck in South Africa. Here’s why:
He kissed me fiercely, his joy taking my breath away. I put my hands on his hips and brought our groins together. John rubbed against me, the heat of his hardness seeping through the fabric. My trousers and drawers felt more and more confining as my prick swelled with each thrust of John’s hips. When the rhythm faltered, I knelt and dove under the skirt of his nightshirt. I nuzzled his hardening prick, inhaling the heady scent of his arousal. His coarse pubic hair grazed my cheek, making me shiver and tingle. I trailed kisses along his prick until I reached the crown. John gasped quietly when I teased the slit with the tip of my tongue. Then I took him into my mouth as deeply as I could and started to suck in earnest, caressing his bollocks with my hand at the same time. My ministrations quickly coaxed John to full stand. He moaned and rocked his hips, his rigid prick pushing into my throat. I suppressed my gag reflex, opened up wider and swallowed him deeper. He was as careful as ever. While he knew that my arse could take a decent pounding, he was always gentle with my throat, too gentle even. He wouldn’t risk a more vigorous pace, for the very possibility it might hurt me was unacceptable to him.
I won’t dwell on the near-misses I had whilst climbing down. It was a messy and rather unpleasant affair. It will suffice to say that I made it, more or less uninjured. In the forest I found a brook, brought my appearance into order as much as was possible, and carefully proceeded to the station. In the shop by the station I purchased a cloak and a hat which helped me to disguise myself a bit. After that, I boarded the train to Bern where I knew one of Mycroft’s agents resided on a permanent basis.
With that, he left as abruptly as he had arrived. His departure was a relief. What a strange family, one sibling an outlaw, and the other the Queen’s hound. I was caught up in the middle of some sort of devilish plot, and my head was bursting with questions.
The relief I felt was headier than any drug-induced euphoria. It dwarfed the gnawing fear which nevertheless remained deep in my soul. John’s salty lips tasted like home as we kissed and kissed and couldn’t have enough.
“Nothing, Mrs. Hudson,” I said in a calmer but scathing tone. “In fact, all is well. Mr. Holmes is not ill. He pretended,
I especially like the way the Granada adaptation handled Holmes’s dismissal of Gibson’s words that succeeding in the case would get the press “booming” Holmes. The camera briefly shifts to a chuckling Watson who shares Holmes’s amusement, and then Holmes says,
The air of freedom was more heady than a potent drink. Even from a cursory glance it was clear that people here had a different life: they were not policed at every corner, having reclaimed their right to live as they pleased. That was what we would soon set out to do in our own country.
I gave a start. He was quite right: watching proved to be so titillating I could come just from it, untouched, but I would much prefer to have those deft hands and lips upon my body, and that gorgeous cock to ravish me. My cheeks burning, I obeyed and walked in.
Cold fury blazing in his eyes, Watson sprang to his feet. His cheeks flushed and his nostrils flared; his lips curved in a snarl. It was a treat to watch him suppress his temper. He was on the verge of shouting abuse at me, yet managed not to. Excellent.
In vain I tried to focus on the case and think of its details. My body refused to be governed by the mind. I would have found it annoying, disturbing even, for I used to pride myself on my ability to put mind over matter. Yet my rule didn’t always apply to John. With him I had learned that sometimes the best way to get rid of temptation was to yield to it, as Wilde aptly phrased it.
There was a sudden prickling in my eyes when I found myself at the front door of 221b. I caressed its wooden panels before slipping my key into the lock. The thrill was almost the same as thirteen years ago, when I first arrived here with my scant belongings and was greeted by John’s shy but genuine smile.
“You did nothing of the sort,” Stamford retorted, assisting me in a surprisingly proficient manner. “You failed to catch me. Besides, the doctor needs spare hands to save this poor devil. And I once studied medicine at the University of London.”
John clutched me by the shoulders and began to tremble. I helped him to sit up, holding him and drinking in his scent.
One more point I’d like to mention is that burglars in this novel, as it often happens in ACD’s works, have their criminality written on their ruffianly faces. A far cry from Raffles, the gentleman thief.
With a complacent air Lestrade ordered Rance to check the attic and the cellar. He himself examined the bedroom and Martha’s room, which was adjacent to the kitchen. Having glanced into the kitchen, he was about to leave as I dearly wished he would, but at the last moment his beady eyes stopped at the pantry door.
“He’s been starving himself these days,” I replied quietly. “Would you get us a cab please, Lestrade?”
The ride to the Colonel’s house was pleasant. We rattled along narrow lanes which wound their way amongst endless fields and pastures. The air was rich with the scent of new greenery, and the cheerful April sun brightened one’s spirits. Nature was waking up from her winter slumbers, having regained her strength for a new beginning. Lively rural vistas inspired relaxed contemplations, a meditative state unmarred by sorrows, anxieties, and stress of the city. Holmes seemed to be enjoying himself, although he wouldn’t have admitted it. He slipped his arm through mine with a contented sigh.
“Thank you,” I said, as deeply touched by the sentiment as by the gift itself. “I also have something for you.”
He put his arm over my shoulder and led me to our corner. John’s scent and the firmness of his body against mine soothed me. He was right: making too much commotion wouldn’t do at all.
Back at Baker Street, condolences began to arrive in heaps. The sight of black-edged envelopes piled on my desk made me sick at heart. I asked Mrs. Hudson to keep them in her parlour for the time being. She tried to cajole me into having dinner, or at least tea. From a medical point of view I understood the importance of sustenance, yet the very mention of food was repulsive.
“Our vows are renewed, I take it,” he murmured. “Do you promise then that you’ll stop advising me to find myself a wife whenever a fit of black mood is upon you?”
“Dearest Mrs. Hudson, please, please forgive me,” he said earnestly. “I’ll clean up my room first thing in the morning. There will be no chemical experiments, no indoor shooting, and no violin playing in the middle of the night, for a week—for two weeks—for a month! And double pay for the rent, how about that?”
“We shan’t need a country vacation, Mycroft,” I said. “Kindly inform of my resignation whomever it may concern. If that is all you came to discuss, I must ask you to bring this interview to an end.”
I think the same is true about Watson, that he, too, has “the Celtic enthusiasm and power of attachment” (HOUN). He has a certain duality about his character just as Holmes does. On the one hand Watson is reserved and infinitely patient as befits a gentleman and a good doctor. On the other Watson is impressionable, emotional, and poetic, and has a flair for the dramatic (again a common trait with Holmes—they both are such drama queens). Watson’s emotions are always lurking under the surface, but Watson keeps them at bay most of the times which is quite telling of the strength of his character and also kindness. Even when Holmes goes too far, Watson forgives him.
We descended to the sitting-room by late afternoon, exactly in time for the grandiose dinner Mrs. Hudson had prepared. John and I insisted that she, Jenny, and Billy join us at the table. The first course had just been finished when our festivities were interrupted by a delegation from the press requesting an interview. Their network of informants must have been rather effective. We sent a polite decline through Mrs. Hudson, but the less reputable pressmen continued to clamour under our windows.
“Of course I will, Mrs. Hudson,” I assured her. “Likewise, you are welcome in my house anytime, whenever you need medical assistance or just someone to talk to.”
My teeth set, I knocked at the door. The maid who answered informed me that the doctor had just gone out. No, I wouldn’t like to leave a message for him and would call on him at another hour, thank you.
“I thought you wouldn’t mind.” Holmes shrugged his shoulders. “Besides, you were out gambling, so there was no opportunity.”
“I believe you,” I replied soothingly. “Sherlock, you haven’t been eating these three days, have you?”
ACD’s stories do have strong female characters like Irene Adler or Violet Hunter, but very often a woman in the plot is a femme fatale or a damsel in distress. In
Both John and Mrs. Hudson marvelled a great deal at the exactness with which the renowned Monsieur Oscar Meunier had created my wax replica. With the blinds down in the sitting-room, I placed it in my armchair and shrouded it in my old dressing-gown. As soon as the gas was lit, its silhouette would be clearly seen in the window. Mrs. Hudson rehearsed altering the bust’s position from her hands and knees, which worked out to perfection. She rose from the floor with some grumbling about the crick in her hip, but the expression in her eyes was fond.
. I had never imagined that such a thing could be so exciting—indeed I used to be puzzled that there were people who were into it. But with John I felt free to explore. I trusted him like no one else in the whole world, even myself.
“You? Ready to die? Really? You, who’d rather sacrifice children than yourself,” Holmes said with contempt.
Note that in 1899 Holmes is 45, and in BOSC, which took place in 1889, Holmes refers to Watson and himself as “middle-aged”, so it again proves that Milverton’s case was before Reichenbach (Howell’s date of death is also suggestive of the exact year). Several days later,
He gave me a rather cheeky grin, turned, and went slowly towards the fireplace where it was warmer. Fair enough. If I wished to have him naked, he shouldn’t be chilled. The fire flickered merrily behind the screen, making John’s skin glow. John placed his hands on the mantelpiece, bent his back, widened his stance, and stuck out his bum a little. Those taut, round mounds were a work of art, a masterpiece for me alone to admire in private. How could I resist this siren call?
We argued for half an hour and nearly had a row, but it was impossible to persuade John. He stood his ground in spite of all my reasoning. Finally we decided to carry on as we had planned before and explore Switzerland. It struck me that over the years together we had never had such an extended holiday, enjoying unlimited time in each other’s company and a foreign country. We admired the sights, savoured local delicacies, rested, and made love. Everything was perfect except for the constant fear I had for John. Signs of Moriarty’s presence were reported just a step behind wherever we went.
Eventually the brother found them both on the train and attempted to persuade the young man to leave the criminal path while the partner spoke against it:
Predictably, there was a crowd of onlookers outside of the Adair residence. The crowd was discussing the murder excitedly, numerous people pointing at the window of Ronald Adair’s room. Approaching the house any closer was not feasible in such a commotion. Nor did it prove necessary, for I quickly satisfied myself as to the single point I had come to observe. My conjecture proved to be correct: a large oak-tree stood exactly opposite Adair’s window, and the distance between the tree and house was ideal for an air-gun. Adair had been murdered after ten o’clock in the evening. The public which prowled Hyde Park by night—rogues, prostitutes, or men interested in other men—steered clear of the police. If any one had noticed Moran climbing the tree, they would not have raised an alarm.
“Come, it’s my turn to spoil you.” He pecked me on the tip of my nose and rose from the bed in search of his dressing-gown.
Sherlock, and being helpless. Now I can be of assistance. At least I can take care of you. You don’t realise what this means to me.”
“Happy to oblige. Well,” he gave me an appraising look, “the treatment had a most satisfying effect. However, we shall need to continue the therapy.”
“Then there is the mysterious malady called brain fever, which always attacks the heroine after a crisis, but which is unknown under that name to the text books. People when they are over-excited in novels fall down in a fit. In a fairly large experience I have never known anyone do so in real life.”
Holmes’s rhythm grew erratic, his breath ragged, as we both were getting close to the edge again. He went slower, and I straightened myself up so that my back touched his chest. We kissed tenderly while he caressed my chest and teased my nipples, and then he slid out of me. We laid ourselves down on the bed, and he spread his legs for me, his prick standing at attention. I too knew the kind of foreplay he wanted. I applied a copious amount of vaseline on my two fingers and slathered his entrance, tapping at the rim lightly. Holmes threw back his head and closed his eyes with a sigh. Circling my thumb along his perineum, I pushed my forefinger in and stroked him inside. When I prodded a small, round mound, Holmes let out a luxurious moan. As I kept fondling it, Holmes was grunting quietly, slack-mouthed, his gaze heavy-lidded and unseeing. I added my middle finger and gradually increased the intensity, now thrusting deeper, now brushing against the sensitive spot until he was trembling and clenching his arse. My stiff member was leaking for him, but I wasn’t done with titillating him yet.
He was in pain again, so I had asked Martha to serve our supper upstairs. I had brought up my rickety armchair too and was sitting by his side, the tray with our meal between us.
From the inner pocket of his jacket he took out a small, oblong parcel and handed it to me. I opened it; inside was a case containing an exquisite custom-made pen.
Dr. Verrinder Smith is neither. She earned her medical degree by diligent studies, insight, and resolve in spite of the prejudice she has to face from her male colleagues and difficulties which it entails. The protagonist of the story is Dr. James Ripley who is one of those prejudiced men. He is intrigued when a distinguished doctor of a European reputation arrives to the neighbourhood. While it’s a potential rival, it’s also a kindred mind, someone to discuss latest discoveries in medicine and compare notes. So he decides to visit the newcomer first.
Smith assured me that he would come shortly; with that, I was back home, in Holmes’s room. Hiding inside the wardrobe between wigs and costumes was hardly dignified, but the furnishings of his room offered no other option.
“John is the best part of my life.” I breathed in and out, calming myself. “But you’re the one who considers feelings a weakness. You saw how broken
The next day, having tracked down Jelland’s associate, who was the link between the notorious forger and the Professor, I made sure that the Yard wouldn’t lose the trail. Everything went as smoothly as I had predicted, so I was free by late afternoon in time for the appointment with Mycroft at the Diogenes Club. John was to join us there upon completing his rounds; his valise had already been packed since morning.
The very sight of the Highland Fling made me cringe internally. Buttermilk mixed with corn flour, salt and pepper had always been effective only in upsetting my stomach. However, it would have been utter discourtesy to refuse a refreshment offered by the mistress of the house with such genuine concern. Mrs. Hudson, bless her, suggested that I should better rest and thus saved me from the awkward situation.
Holmes, in turn, listens to Watson’s report with rapt attention, and there’s something downright erotic in the way Watson describes his seeming languor:
about doctors. Dr. Ripley fell in love with Dr. Smith while she was treating him. He proposed to her, but she declined, intending to dedicate her life to science, and soon left for France, having being offered a position there. Poor Dr. Ripley was brokenhearted.
In the morning Sherlock’s mood was good, and to secure this precarious improvement I suggested we had a walk after breakfast. But suddenly those plans were thwarted. As we were in the middle of our meal and the Colonel was recommending to us the most picturesque places in the vicinity, the butler burst into the dining-room quite out of breath. The story from the evening before about the local burglary had received a gruesome development: the neighbours’ coachman had been murdered. No sooner had the butler related to us the details and we started pondering the matter, a young police inspector arrived. He explained that he had heard of Holmes’s being on a visit here and requested the celebrated detective’s help. Circumstances were clearly working against my efforts to keep my partner away from physical and mental exertions. Of course Sherlock agreed to join the investigation, and all I could do was to tag along, hoping that he wouldn’t fall ill again. It turned out to be a peculiar case which deserves a write-up of its own, separately from this journal.
“Yes, he sent a note all of a sudden, asking me to take over for a few days,” I replied. “Considering how many times he helped out when I had to leave on a short notice, it’s only fair to return the favour. What about you? Any progress with your case?”
It’s characteristic of people who spend a lot of time together to rub off on each other. Especially in case of spouses.
I ceased my ministrations. He rose and turned, and the next instant my breath was taken away by a most fervent kiss, and then Holmes was off to the water closet. While he was there, I made the bed with fresh sheets I had brought with me—cleanliness was important for us both in this regard. Soon Holmes returned and embraced me from behind. His hands roamed over my chest, sides, and hips as he was removing my remaining clothes. Those hands had always been my undoing; he could play me like his violin, knowing countless chords of my body, improvising and discovering more. He kept cataloguing my responses and sensitive spots every time we were intimate. Now it was I who submitted himself completely to his lover.
The proprietor himself, as spry and dandyish as ever, greeted us from behind the counter when we entered the reception room. He was a good acquaintance of ours and a former client. A few years ago we had helped him to untangle a delicate matter which otherwise would have produced a grievous effect upon his thriving business.
hurt by Holmes’s words during the years of their companionship, Holmes always, always apologised. Et voilà, Watson downplaying his own merits and glorifying Holmes. Also, judging by 3GAR, I bet Holmes defended Watson from Green’s assault much more fiercely than Watson described.
We were met at the door by the butler, a bleak fellow of indefinite age who resembled the doorman at the Diogenes Club. The butler introduced himself as Rogers and said that the main bedroom at the end of the gallery up on the first floor was ready for us. He also explained that the servants lived in a separate wing and customarily did not enter the master's part of the house unless rung for. It was very much like Mycroft. All his domestic staff were trained in that fashion. The butler carried our belongings upstairs and disappeared.
Handling such obstinacy from two sides was becoming cumbersome. It was possible to ignore Mycroft, but John surely wouldn’t leave the matter alone. I knew that he was speaking from the bitter experience with his own older brother.
. Watson begins with a statement that all his confidential papers regarding past cases are kept safely in a bank vault which is quite reasonable given his mentioning in VEIL that there had been attempts of break-ins at their Baker Street lodgings. Since Holmes is an expert in burglary himself, 221b must be quite burglar-proof, but letting the public know that the archive is in not even there is a good strategy to prevent any future instances. He also reminds that Holmes and he treat information they possess with utmost discretion, and that his fictionalised accounts are selected in a way which could not possibly harm their former clients and their families. Indeed, in openings of many stories it is highlighted that either a permission was given or the person in question passed away.
The relationship between McPherson and Murdoch is a curious parallel between Holmes and Victor Trevor. In both cases two men meet because the dog which belongs to one of them attacks the other. Murdoch resembles Holmes in many ways, being tall, thin, dark, and somewhat detached from reality, living in his own world.
And when Holmes identifies the noble lady who killed Milverton, he communicates with Watson silently, which only proves again how exceptionally close they are.
The largest nineteenth-century epidemic of influenza, called ‘the Russian epidemic,’ arrived in Europe from the east in November and December of 1889. It was the first epidemic to be so widely commented on in the intensively developing daily press. First information concerning the epidemic in London appeared in the press around the middle of December 1889. (
The news of the Adair murder reached me when I was finishing up in America. Moran had finally made a slip. Left penniless and demoralised by the collapse of the criminal empire he had failed to preserve, he had stooped to cheating at cards. The time was ripe for my return.
Another curious parallel with the Doyle family is a character of old Mr. McIntyre, a drinking father who gradually descends into madness and later is locked away in an asylum. Rather similar to ACD’s own father, Charles Altamont Doyle.
“And it’s highly unlikely that he has a marriage in prospect,” added a small, nasty voice in my head.
“It’s just a broken clock, sir,” Clara said apologetically. “Seems rather harmless. A piece of junk. I’ll throw it away.”
At noon a nondescript cargo vessel departed from the port. No one had paid attention to the two tramps whom Captain Croker had allowed to creep into one of the ship’s holds. There we travelled among crates and barrels until we reached Calais and disembarked as discreetly as we had got onboard.
My heart fluttered. Those inhuman creatures thrived on torturing their victims into madness with the pains they inflicted on the body and horrors on the mind. I had had a brief encounter with their savagery in Afghanistan, and I would never be whole again. Barely breathing, I was cold with slimy sweat.
“He said it quietly, to himself, but his voice carried quite well in the empty hall. I stood paralysed with horror while he left, whistling carelessly.
We were provided with another carriage to take us home, and before we departed Lestrade came and shook us by the hands.
The whole morning was spent on the beach until swimming and frolicking had quite worn us out. It was time to fortify ourselves at the pub Sherlock had mentioned. We had towels and spare dry drawers with us, so I expected that we would head straight to the village, but Sherlock led me back to the house.
