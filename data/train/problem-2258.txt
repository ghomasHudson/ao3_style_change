When they had finally returned home, with firm instructions for John to keep a vigilant watch over Sherlock, they lay together on the sofa spooned together with Sherlock's chest to John's back. John had made an inquiry about Sherlock's past. After some time had passed, and the sun was beginning to leave the sky, Sherlock began to speak.
He left nothing to the imagination. At particularly hard points in his life he would pause and John would snuggle back into his embrace and places his hands more firmly against Sherlock's that lay across his stomach. When the tale had finished and several cups of tea had been consumed, the sun had fled and the moon shone brilliantly through the darkened night.
"Love, it's fine. It's all fine. We don't have to do anything you don't want to do." Sherlock looks at John skeptically for a moment before he slowly nods his head in acceptance. The ebony haired man climbs back to his original position beside John. The detective leans forward hesitantly and places a gentle kiss against his bondmate's lips. Sherlock allows the kiss to deepen for a moment before pulling away to say, "I think- I want- you to touch me, John."
He was hoping to have a little more time before John started
The Reichenbach Fall or......
Where just a few that were running rampant throughout his mind. When the kiss had ended Sherlock, despite feeling overwhelmed, had enjoyed the connection he could feel with John. It was as if an electric spark shot throughout his nervous system drawing them together. Yet...John wanted him to delete it. John doesn’t care about Sherlock the way Sherlock cares about John. John is Sherlock’s weak point, his college, his partner, his friend… His best friend.
Sherlock laughs and responds, “I told her she should stop wasting time on Anderson because he just found out he has a STD from, once again, cheating on his wife and he has given it to her. I told her since you were a doctor, you could direct her in some topical or oral medication. “ John stood for a moment looking utterly shocked until he tried, and failed, to look stern as he tries to hide his laughter, “Sherlock!” The devious detective places an angelic look on his face, “What’s the matter, John? I was only looking after a colleague’s well being!” Both men giggle at the blatant lie.
When Sherlock turned 16 he knew something was wrong with him. The other children would taunt him endlessly. "
"Because I love you." He chokes out the unfamiliar words,
!" Sherlock hisses as he tries to twist out of John's firm grasp. "No!" John bellows, "Not until you explain what these are!"

John's heart clenches in his chest for his belittled soulmate. He steps forward and wraps his arms around the detective's slim waist before burying his head in his chest. "There's nothing wrong with you love. People will belittle the unique and beautiful because they feel intimidated or inferior to someone else. To make themselves appear big, they will crush and stop the brightest stars until they can't shine. You are the brightest star there ever was. They feel intimidated by you so they try to make you feel like you aren't worth anything, but you are the most valuable person I know. The world would be so dark without you and I would be so lost and lonely with you gone. You have given me so much and I owe you everything. I love you and many others do as well. We know you are wonderful just the way you are."

A trite "Soap Opera" (Which didn't make sense. The only thing the show had anything to do with bathing would be the 'smutty' shower scene and the only reason Sherlock had known that word would be because John had said it once before.) was on. Besides the holey and repetitive plot-line, the obsessive fascination to sex (
John felt his knees turn to jelly at the sudden sense of hope that surges through him. However, the feeling is dampened by fear as Mycroft steps forward and viciously states, “But keep this in mind, John. If you ever do anything like this again, you won’t have to worry about gaining Sherlock forgiveness. You won’t be able to worry about anything at all.” Here the auburn haired man pauses for a moment to let his words sink in before he speaks again. If there were any doubt in John’s mind of Mycroft’s sincerity, all of those thoughts flew out the window as the elder man murderously says, “You will never be able to hide from me, John, and if by some chance you can, I will personally hunt you down and destroy you as slowly as I possibly can. Is that clear?” The blogger nods his head in clear understanding and Mycroft thinly smiles and says, “Excellent. I’m glad we understand each other.” The British Government pauses for a moment and steps back into the room before smiling softly, “Ah. Sherlock. How good it is to see you alive and well.”
You care and it's eating you away;

The blogger pulls his threadmate into a slowly kiss, which quickly becomes heated as tongues slide together in an erotic dance. As things begin to get heated, the enamored pair hears a knock on the door. The kisses slow down and become languid until they place loving kisses once, twice, three times until John pulls away to check the door. Just before the army doctor can open the threshold, Sherlock takes a small step forward and asks, in a very hesitant voice, “Later?” John’s answers with a quick nod and a stunning smile.

special?” Each word that spills out of John’s mouth is laced with pure disdain and bitterness. Sherlock opens his mouth to ask yet another question but John cuts him off, “Do you realize how close I was to becoming Brian Barkley? I was miserable for two years after your death, and I wanted to end it all. I had everything prepared. I was planning to go through with it until I met Mary. Mary was wonderful and sweet, and I was in love with her. You came back and everything went to hell. I found out on my fucking wedding day that she was sleeping with another man and the baby is his. I couldn’t get over you, and my marriage fell apart because of it, but what do you care, right? Sherlock Bloody Holmes doesn’t have or need friends, never mind relationships.” Sherlock takes an almost imperceptive step back and stutters out, “John, I-I’m sorry. I thought things were okay. I don’t unders—.”
As the two weeks slowly pass, Harry slowly gets better. The withdrawal pains begin the next day and Harriet writhes around on the bed in seemingly agony as the synthetic emotion slowly exits her body. Once she had successfully expelled all of the traces of the drug from her system, the cravings set in. Suddenly, she

Sherlock can feel something in his chest constrict and tighten as the anguish once again washes over him. The weight of the past few days causes him to crumble to the cold alley floor. When the initial shock of the moment passed, a lingering, hollow feeling envelopes the detective. The ebony haired man gasps for air as he stumbles blindly to his feet and his legs carry him to the darkest part of the alleyway. He somehow manages to type in a number he had never truly forgotten, and with shaking, stumbling fingers, he manages to type out a brief message and hits send.
The grin from before returns to the bloggers face as he nods his acceptance. When they reach the dance floor, the ebony genius slots their legs together and grabs his soulmate’s hands and places them on his hips. Sherlock rhythmically rocks against his loving doctor along with the songs slow beat.

synthetic happiness. She would burst into tears at the thought of going without it, but eventually, Harriet got better. She was more of herself than she had been in years, albeit a bit more depressed than before, but that was nothing Clara couldn’t handle. Clara was ecstatic about gaining her wife back. The alcohol and synthetic drugs put such a heavy strain on their marriage, but now things were finally looking up. When John’s two weeks leave finally ended, both Clara and the younger Watson felt confident in Harriet’s recovery. They knew the road ahead would be a hard one, for everyone involved, but with love and support, they could succeed.
John turns away from the speechless oppressors and turns toward his beloved detective before going up on tiptoes to kiss his cheek, "Come on love, let's head home." John then tugs gently at Sherlock's arm until he gets the idea and they exit the crime scene together. They both enter the cab but Sherlock has still yet to have spoken a single word. When they arrive at 221B Sherlock exits first then he followed closely by John after he has paid the cabbie.

Yes, he still loves the detective. He loves the detective more than ever, it seems, but he has made a commitment. He has made the commitment to move on. Besides, if the feelings were mutual, Sherlock wouldn’t have left to begin with. With that thought in mind, he straightens his shoulders and soldiers on.
They finally meet!!!
The perfect opportunity arose when he met the Dominatrix and Femme Fatale Irene Adler. Irene was very similar to Sherlock. Aside from Moriarty, her mind had been the greatest match to his own. She was an enigma, a puzzle, that deserved, no

"When we were at the pool, I started seeing things again. It all originally started when I was ten. I started to notice something was wrong. In my head... I saw these ghastly things. My head would play different scenarios. Different deaths. It only used to be mine. That didn't bother me that much but then you came into my life... Alone protects me John, it doesn't hurt that way, but you came along and broke down my walls, you wormed your way into my heart and you made me feel! So now, I see you! You die. Every time. By me, my hands! I hurt YOU! Over, and over, and over again! I could live with the thought of something happening to myself but not to you. I was better off alone..."
As the door swings closed he lets himself break down and cry.
Minutes or hours pass them by without the pair noticing. When they finally break their tight embrace, both men seem to finally realize how close they are to each other. John’s eyes drop down to the detective’s lips and one hand comes up to gently cup Sherlock’s cheek. Slowly, so as to give Sherlock plenty of time to pull away if needed, John leans in and kisses the one and only Consulting Detective. It is soft and sweet and everything a first kiss
"Yeah?"
Anyway...Poor Sherlock! It's not going to get better for awhile, guys. It's going to hurt, but I promise things do eventually get better :). I hope you enjoyed it! I'm having a blast writing it :D
Sherlock giggles once more, but he never stops leading them into a gentle sway of hips. In a move that is uncharacteristically beneath a Holmes, Sherlock stumbles over his own feet and collides into John. If the doctor had been more drunk, he would not have remained standing, but, as it were, John only steadies the other man. A slimmer body presses into John’s and a sharp chin rest on John’s good shoulder as he continues to try and lead them into a sloppy waltz. This sets the detective off once more and long fingers tangle themselves into a wooly jumper as he moves back enough to glance down at his dear friend. Sharp, piercing eyes grow achingly softer and into something so tender and reverent as a slow smile spreads across the detective’s reddened face. This sobers John up quickly. He pulls the detective impossibly closer into a firm embrace, hoping he can get away with it considering Sherlock’s intoxicated state. A happy sigh escapes past cupid bow lips as he softly demands, “Stay with me tonight.”
He takes the carton over to the sink and pours out the rest of its contents. Once he is satisfied with his handy work, he throws it away and texts Mycroft the time of their meeting which would take place in an hour. When everything has been tidied and sorted, Sherlock waits in his mind palace until John decides to wake up.
When his eyes eventually landed on the victim, Sherlock’s mind began to formulate deductions based on what he could see and he already knew that the D.I. and his team had come to the wrong conclusion. ‘
Sherlock laughs but it sounds broken and dry. "I owe you no explanation." Sherlock is finally able to twist away and he is he turns away from John, hunches his shoulders, and ducks his head. "If you are too incompetent to conceive what these..

In the morning, Sherlock opens his eyes to a bright, sunny day with a smile on his face. '
Just as John was about to say something he would probably regret, Sherlock’s phone pinged with an incoming message. One long lanky arm unwound itself from the tangled sheet to bring the phone up to the detective’s face. The infuriating man lunged from the couch, dropping the sheet, and ran up the stairs starkers all the while yelling down to John about a new case. Normally, Sherlock’s antics would have stopped this infuriated mood, but with all the stress from work, the recent divorce from Mary, finding out that the baby wasn’t his, and now being thrown back into Sherlock’s insane lifestyle, John was at his breaking point. The blogger gripped the edge of the counter tightly as Sherlock breezed into the kitchen, now fully dressed, and looked into the fridge for the missing milk. He then unhelpfully informed John that they were out and that he would need to go and get some more. He then wanted to know why John wasn’t dressed yet.
To Sherlock's dismay, his recovery time had taken four weeks and five days. If you had asked John, he would muttered something about a "Bloody git, not taking his injuries seriously," and then you would have heard a louder comment, as if John were hinting to the infuriating detective, about "Needing a few more days of rest! (Said detective refused to sleep for more than four hours each night, thus the need for a longer recovery time)" Although, if you had asked Sherlock, he would have adamantly disagreed and then say that he was ready to go back four weeks ago.
The two nights before the besotted two were to wed, Lestrade arrives at Baker Street to

As if sensing his thoughts, Sherlock bows his head and whispers an, “I love you,” against his mate’s lips before gently capturing them with his own. This is what the night was missing. He didn’t need flashing lights, alcohol, or (to use Sherlock’s word) exotic dancers to have a good time. Being in their flat with the man he loved the most, was all the celebration John needed.
Off to other things. Happy belated, belated Valentine's Day! I hope you enjoy this chapter! As always happy reading!!
Anyway, onto the special thanks portion of these notes.
The terrible man snickers and says in a condescending way, “Threadmate?” The soldier stares at the man squarely and replies, “Colleague.” The fragile genius drops his gaze to the floor to hide the brief flash of pain that crosses his face. The moment passes quickly, but not before John sees the look.
He had
In John and Sherlock’s shared opinion, they had never seen anyone more beautiful. The detective was wearing a fitted, black, bespoke suit, which clung to his skin in just the right ways. Underneath the black material lies a striking white shirt and deep purple vest, which was finished off with a matching purple bow tie. John, on the other hand, wore the same stylish black suit, a crisp white shirt, but with a bright blue vest along with his own matching bow tie. The soon to be wedded pair meet each other in the middle and embrace. John says into his threadmate’s chest, “I missed you very much.” Sherlock rests his head on top of the blogger’s sandy blond hair: “I did not anticipate the effect one day would have, but I must confess that I missed you, too.”
This day was supposed to be joyous and exciting. This day was meant to be filled with happy tears and warm, broad smiles. This day contained none of those things. The day John Hamish Watson’s life began, his mother’s tragically ended.
, John.”
When he finally finishes at Baker Street, it only takes a few hours, and he knows he’s hot on her trail. He pulls out his phone and calls John.
Sherlock needs some advice
John walks over to the door and gently knocks but receives no answer. After several minutes of consistent knocking and still no reply, John trudges up to his room and slumps down onto the bed. Hours later, when the house is still and John is asleep in bed, Sherlock would venture out of his room to retrieve his violin. He would draw the bow across the strings, turn the peg slightly, and then proceeds to play.
"Do you honestly believe that?" Sherlock's head snaps up at John's broken tone. He searches John's face for a moment before he drops his head and lowly whispers, "No, but it's better than being tortured every day... I could make sure you were safe that way."
Forty-five minutes later, the half-awake army doctor stumbles into the living room and blearily plants a sloppy kiss against the executive's lips. A half mumbled "G'morning" is spoken until John makes his way slowly into kitchen. Once there, the blogger begins the process of making tea, thus discovering the missing milk. "Sherlock, did you use
Mycroft put Sherlock through the proper programs, they kept him on suicide watch for about three months (72 hours spent at the hospital, with

, he had the proof right in front of him. Sherlock readily and quickly agreed to help with everything. Obviously it was all one sided
Without turning around, Sherlock states, “As much as it pains me to say, I owe Mycroft a favor. I was stupid to assume that he would do what I asked solely because it mattered so much to me. I am in debt to him, and normally, I would be able to refuse his demands, but I must pay this debt.”
When Sherlock and John finally arrive at the Tower, they both sit in stony silence as Jim Moriarty dances across the screen only to shatter the bullet proof glass encasing the crown jewels, but not before writing the eerie message:
It seemed to reverberate in the near silent room.
When Sherlock had finished he
Here were some of my thoughts while writing this chapter : "John, hunny, why do I write you this way (this is rhetorical, mind you, but I still question my sanity)?" and "I hate myself." That last one was very prominent. I thought that a lot during the wedding. I don't like Mary. It was so freeing to write John in this way. Where he finally just stops. It was freeing. It was like a catharisis. I felt my soul rising above the depths of hell from which I came. Sherlock is so sad and smol. He is just not doing well.
John's anger flares once again and he bites out, “Stop playing these fucking games with me! Do you really want to know?” When he doesn’t receive a response, he barrels on, “I want you to leave me the hell alone! Stop interfering with my life! Stop telling me what I should and shouldn’t do!” Ebony curls somehow sink even lower and pale digits tighten in silky ringlets in an effort to appear smaller than he already does. The only sound that could be heard escapes passed John's lips in angry exhales. Due to this, John almost misses the whispered, “I’m trying.”
It’s been three days. Three days of endless searching in every bolthole, hideaway, and every known location that Moriarty had resided in London. John and Mycroft had plans to travel to Moscow tomorrow for starters in their out of country expedition. Nowhere is too far and distance will not stop them. Greg was working today, but he already planned to spend vacation days traveling to Moscow with the other two men. John went back to Baker Street today so that the blond can pack some clothes and necessities for the trip. Mycroft was taking care of last minute business while Anthea was packing his clothes. The three men have slept a few hours at most, each too worried about the missing detective to do trivial things like eat or sleep.
Never truly understanding how a man could leave two small children and a wife,
Before Sherlock can fully answer John's inquiries, another ping comes from the offending phone. Sherlock thanks any deity out there as he silently stands to retrieve his phone from the coffee table. He can hear John sigh but he isn't sure if it's from exasperation or acceptance.
" Each day he could feel the taunts seeping deeper and deeper into his skin. Sure, he could pretend that everything was alright at school, but when he got home...that was a different matter.
Several of the people who sold their emotions could no longer take the emptiness they felt without them and stopped selling their feelings, and over ¾ of the donating population stopped providing the rest of the community with their usual dosage of emotions. Despite propaganda encouraging people to sell their emotions, people began questioning whether or not giving away their feelings was actually a good idea. Soon, the rumors began. It began as quiet whispers and hushed tones but this quickly escalated to panic when the dreaded word ‘
He had resisted the urge to resort to past methods of destruction for three days. He removed and disabled the tracking device on his phone and he ignored any and all texts or calls from everyone, especially John. He stayed with members of his trusted homeless network and he had managed to stay true to his promise to stay clean despite all the things in his mind reminding him that the one person he loved more than anything now hated him. The only thing that kept Sherlock from the self-destruction he craved was the thought of John’s disappointed face if he found out if Sherlock had fallen back into old habits. That all changed on the third day.
That is until Mr. Watson receives a note home from Harry’s year six teacher when she was caught kissing another girl behind the bleachers at school. He flew into a fit of rage. He viciously grabs Harry’s hair, pulling out several strands in the process, and begins slurring homophobia mercilessly. John arrives home and finds them likes this only minutes after Harry’s own arrival moments before. Being terrified of his father, but wanting to protect his sister, John cautiously goes up to his father as requests politely for Harriet’s freedom. He lets her go, throwing her to the ground in the process, walks over to John and crowds him against the wall, as he replies, “Why, because you’re a fucking faggot, too? Are you going to grow up to be a cocksucker now? You’re just a gay faggot, aren’t you?” With tears in his eyes, John replies, “N-no, I’m not!” Mr. Watson sees red. As he raises his voice, with a, “Don’t you dare back talk me,” he raises his hand and aggressively cuffs John across the face. The sound echoes around the room and the door slams with Mr. Watson’s departure. John collapses against the floor in tears as Harry crawls over to him.
She has lied to me from the moment we met. More importantly, she shot you!” The blogger sees red as the Consulting Detective snorts and waves his hand in dismissal at John’s words, but the former blogger soldiers on, “Plus, did you forget ‘has trust issues?’ And how can you act nonchalantly about the fact that she shot and murdered you? How on Earth could you possibly forgive her?”
All other thoughts recede from his mind as he begins to imagine the world without this infuriating man. He doesn't notice the other man's presence, he doesn't hear the kettle whistle signaling it has finished boiling, and he doesn't hear the other man cutting off the stove and remove said offending kettle. What John does notice is the warm heat of a body sitting next to him on the kitchen floor. When John lifts his head he is met with cool, calculating, verdigris eyes that seem to know what he is always thinking.
Sherlock's room was at the end of the long corridor, room number 354. John was about to enter when Mycroft grabbed his arm. "John. There are some things I feel you need to be made aware of." When Mycroft had John's undivided attention, he continued, "When Sherlock was younger he had more than one addiction than you know of." John's brow furrowed in confusion and worry as he asks, "What do you mean?" Mycroft's grim expression told John enough and he entered the room.

The heavily medicated sleuth beams a broad, joyful smile up at his soul mate. "You came! I told Mycroft you would! He didn't believe me. Stupid git. I almost started to believe him but you're here now, so it's all okay!" John suddenly finds himself wrapped up in long, lanky limbs with dark curls brushing his chin. He bends his head slightly to press a loving kiss into the raven locks. "Yes, I'm here."
The ambulance seemed to take an eternity to arrive. When Sherlock had finally been loaded up into the emergency vehicle, John's expressive face closed down into a stern blank mask. He answered the questions fired off by the Paramedic almost robotically. To an onlooker, John would have appeared totally in control, but John had felt as if everything was moving in slow motion, or as if his entire world had been shaken to the point of ruin. '
John and Sherlock get married!
you’re my best friend.” Sherlock’s expression never truly loses the shocked disbelief after the other man’s confession, and after drinking eyeball infested tea, John has a clue in to Sherlock’s frame of mind.
Panic flows through John as he takes the needle out and throws it across the room as he tries desperately to reach into his pocket to call for help before it’s too late.
Do you see what I'm doing with the chapters? I think I'm being clever, but I'm probably not. ^_^;
The sad look from before passes across his bright eyes briefly until he nods his head, his soft smile never truly leaving his face while his eyes remain impossibly sad as he lisps out a , “S’okay, Jawn. I know.” The detective draws John into a warm embrace, the doctor’s face presses into Sherlock’s shirt. He could swear that the ghost of lips once again press against John’s hairline, before the detective saunters away to his room before John can really make sense of any of it.
John pockets his phone and goes to take his next patient.
“Mycroft, have you seen Sherlock?”
"Shh...I know. Slowly, alright?" Instead of answering, Sherlock's ivory complexion turns a lovely shade of red as the blush deepens and travels further down his neck. He nods his head obediently at John's request and awkwardly places his hands on John's shoulders. John laughs softly and lifts his head slightly, hands moving to grip the back of Sherlock's neck, before whispering against the bashful sleuth's timid lips, "Just...follow my lead."This kiss starts out slow. Sherlock has yet to figure out what to do with his hands, or lips for that matter, but John, ever reliant John, seems to know what is going through his head and gently moves his lips against Sherlock's shy ones.
Greg chuckles, “John, trust me, mate, you have nothing to worry about. Sherlock is different with you. We all can see it. He is so much happier with you around. Yes, he is still occasionally scathing, but it’s different when you’re there, you know? You make him a good man. He loves you with all he has.  Please tell me you’ve seen that.”
Greg finally steps forward with a sigh, “John, you apparently have to come with me. There’s this Holmes family tradition that states that a soulbonded couple getting married has to be separated the night before their wedding day. John looks shocked only before he grumbles out, “What the bloody hell for?”
' Sherlock then takes out his pocket magnifier glass to scrutinize her blouse in more detail, which he then finds a dark brown, curly strand of hair.

He takes several silent steps forward until he is directly in front of the detective before speaking in undisguised affection, “You know, to be a genius, you really are an idiot.”
"John stares fixedly at Sherlock's face. To Sherlock, it looks as if John is trying to gauge his wounds or memorize his face. Sherlock doesn't think he has ever felt more vulnerable. When their eyes meet John closes his eyes and visibly starts to shake. He sinks into the chair that is placed conveniently next to the bed and places his head in his hands.
Sherlock’s face contorts into brief embarrassment from revealing so much to the other man. As he stutters out a reply he blushes under Mycroft’s uncharacteristic caring expression: “Um…Thank you… That thing you did was… um… good.” The care finally leaves from Mycroft’s face as a natural air settles along his facial expression. However, the British government can’t help but fondly squeeze his brother’s arm as he says, “Anytime, brother.”
John's brow furrows in obvious concern as he places the mugs softly down on the counter to stand in front of his threadmate. “Love, look at me... Miss what exactly?”  When the consulting detective finally submitted to his threadmate’s request, his angular face held an expression of nonchalance but the blogger could see through the mask, and he could read the underlying nervousness hidden there. “Don’t you miss the freedom?” There’s a moment of stunned silence until the army doctor opens his mouth to speak but his threadmate cuts him off, “You’ve always dated people without any commitments and now you’re getting married to an unpleasant, rude, ignorant and all-round obnoxious arsehole. It’s no contest, really.”

"You left, John." Came the hollowed whisper through the darkened night.
by telling him that he is a freak? I’m sure that got the message across. Sherlock doesn’t have friends, Doctor Watson. He only has you. He cares about your opinion, but as I’ve always said: caring is not an advantage and you’ve just proven my point.”
When Mycroft had finally came to collect Sherlock, he had been beaten, bloody, and a little worse for wear, but as they boarded a plane back to their beloved city, Sherlock knew it was all worth it. He knew John was safe and protected from the wicked spiders he had been fighting this whole time.
John can hear his approaching fellow troops, but he couldn’t possibly care at this point. John no longer has his life preserver. His thread was like a promise, no matter what hell he had to go through, no matter what pain or suffering or injury he obtained while deployed, he had been promised happiness. Now, he no longer has anything. His hope has been crushed and he couldn’t care at this moment if he were to live or die.
At the age of twenty-three, he was still without a soul mate, he was introduced to cocaine. He, at first, told himself that he was using it to ‘quieten his racing mind’. If he would look within himself he would discover that he was only lying to himself. There were the nights when being so alone left him feeling so hollow inside. There were nights when he truly hated himself more than anything or anyone. Those nights he would tighten the tourniquet, inject the needle into his arm, and push the plunger until he could finally get rid of the emptiness he felt. This routine would continue for three months until Mycroft stepped in, after Sherlock overdosed, one September night.
' His smile then widens as he looks over to his left and sees the sleeping man. If Sherlock had to think of a word to describe this moment, even though he would scorn himself later for such

He thinks to himself. He looks down at himself, at the knife's shiny surface, with self loathing and begins to think back to all the times they had had together. He bitterly laughs when he realizes that he was the one to ruin it all. His grip tightens further on the knife and his eyes harden and his body runs cold.

"I took Gregory out to our favorite restaurant, treated him to anything he could want, and proposed. He said yes." All of this was said with an abnormally fond smile from Mycroft Holmes.

Greg soon finds the pair and drags them back to the booth in order to enjoy a round of pints. The soon to be wedded couple sit closely together, breathing the other’s air, and basking in the ability to be close. Whispered sentiments from the connected pair reach the D.I.’s ears and when Lestrade realizes that he won’t be heard in his attempts to initiate small talk, he smiles fondly and says something along the lines of retrieving more pints.
love any of them. Yes, you are all of those things, but I’m not going anywhere. I know how you are and I love you because of them, not despite of them.”
Each of these lovely individuals listened to me rant, rave, and talk about this story for DAYS on end. They each have read, reread, and read some more just because I asked and for that, I am so thankful. So, THANK YOU SO MUCH!! This story has been in the making for a long time, and without these people, it would not have been possible. I hope you enjoy it as much as I have. :)
"No. You don't get to speak yet. Give me a moment."
“I’m here now, Sherlock,” is whispered just as quietly back.

“Here, John. I-I want you to have this. I-I can’t…I just can’t keep this anymore. Harry would want you to have it anyway. She wanted to surprise you with a new phone for your birthday anyway. It seems only fitting that you just take this one,” she states, refusing to look at John in case the tears return at full force. John tries to refuse, but Clara quickly tramples that down with, “I…I just can’t look at it anymore, John. Please?” Begrudgingly, John nods his acceptance.
The smile, though, slowly falls from John's face as he remembers that he needs to speak to Sherlock. Sherlock, of course, instantly deduces the reason behind the doctors change in mood and proceeds, in hopes to avoid this conversation, to get out of bed. He makes his way to the kitchen, where he then makes his way to the couch for a good sulk.

When it was finally time to make the arrests Sherlock and Lestrade chased the villain throughout the streets of London. Sherlock, '
“God, Sherlock. Where in the world did you learn that?!” The detective suddenly becomes bashful as he replies, “I’ve been practicing, John. Was that alright?” John giggles and gently takes his threadmate’s face in his hands and says between kisses, “Like it? Sherlock, love, that was incredibly sexy. I loved it and I love you.” Sherlock lets out a relieved sigh, “Good. I love you too, John.
Sherlock waits for just a moment before saying, “No... because I took your pulse, and I waited. And your pupils dilated. I imagine John Watson thinks love's a mystery to me,” Sherlock remembers briefly a conversation about love that entails kisses and smiles bitterly while he retrieves her phone. “But the chemistry is incredibly simple and very destructive. When we first met you told that a disguise is always a self-portrait; how true of you. The combination to your safe - your measurements but this, this is far more, this is your heart,” Sherlock Inserts a letter, “And you should never let it rule your head. You could have chosen any random number and walked out of here today with everything you've worked for,” He inserts another letter. “But you just couldn't resist it, could you? I've always assumed that love is a dangerous disadvantage.” Another. “Thank you for the final proof.” He inserts the final letter of the code and the phone unlocks.
Chairman, President, and CEO
And just like that, John’s heart begins racing. He leans back enough to put space between them as he mutters out unintelligently, “I... uh… I think you should get some rest, Sherlock.”

John's not naïve enough to believe that if Sherlock hadn't been so heavily medicated, that he would have gotten this much out of the introverted man. Sherlock has obviously been more affected by John's absence than he lets on. He had never thought about it from Sherlock's perspective. He had only ever thought about his hurt or his pain, but now, he realizes it has not been all one-sided. When Sherlock next awoke, they would have to have a serious discussion about everything.
Sherlock then turns to Alicia, a brunette with curling ringlets, before continuing his discourse with slightly narrowed eyes, "Each victim had an extraordinary talent that used both eyes and hands. Our killer is an envious, destructive individual with little to no direction in her life. They always blamed others for their mistakes. Our suspect had a troubled childhood. No, they weren't abused but they were the troubled middle child. The black sheep of the family." He turns away from Alicia to walk over to the mantle where each photo had been meticulously cleaned and taken care except the last picture on the mantle of Brianna and Alicia. They are hugging each other stiffly, smiles forced, and eyes staring solely at the camera.
John, however, is slow on the uptake, “Mary...where’s the baby?” He asks in disbelief, but the rest of her sentence catches up to him, “Party…? What are you talking about? Where’s Moriarty?”
The doctor does not know how long he stands there, but the happy buzz from before has long since diminished into panic, disbelief, and a wild hope that threatens to send him to his knees.
The first obvious mistake of the night occurs when the dynamic duo split up as Sherlock barrels up the stairway and John sits with Janine until she regains consciousness or until the ambulance he called arrives. It wasn’t until Sherlock walks into the spacious office to find Magnussen lying dead from a bullet wound to the head, and a figure dressed in all black standing over the man’s lifeless corpse.
Although I do not feel the same way as you do, I believe I will be able to ignore them in the future. "
Sherlock’s head whips around at breakneck speed as he instantly drops his arms and straightens to his full height. A scarlet blush spreads across his cheeks and his eyes widen as Sherlock realizes he’s been caught doing something sentimental and incredibly ridiculous.
The sleuth straightens to his full height, turns his face slightly, and says in an air of feigned indifference, “I wanted to thank you for taking such good care of me.” John’s grin broadens and he stretches up on his tiptoes to place a lingering kiss against the detective’s smooth cheek. “Love, you didn’t have to do all this, but thank you anyway.” Sherlock only smiles and leads the besotted blogger to the table and sits him gently down. He goes over to his violin case to retrieve his beloved violin and draws the bow lightly across the strings. He tunes the pegs for a few seconds but then quickly sweeps John away in his beautiful melody.
"The Victim's name is Brianna Andrews, age 22. Her sister Alicia found her." Greg points her out then says, "The previous victims are members of her family. Mother Christina Andrews, age 43." Lestrade pauses briefly in his update to hand over pictures of each deceased member to Sherlock before continuing, "And sister Samantha Andrews, age 15. All Victims have had the same treatment. Neck sliced, right hand decapitated, then eyes gouged. We think these traits are part of the serial killer's M.O."

Sherlock's hands grab John's hips and begin to move downward until he reaches the waistband of John's pants. He teases his fingertips under the cloth and John gets the hint and raises up slightly to take them off. When he is completely bare, John reaches downward, and silently asks for permission. When he receives another small nod, he gently pulls the pants off and they land somewhere on the floor in the darkened corner.
Sherlock thinks,
When Sherlock catches sight of John though he says, far too loudly, "JOHN!" The previously drowsy detective begins to struggle against the constricting sheets wrapped around his legs until a chuckling army doctor walks forward and lays a steadying hand on Sherlock's smooth pale chest before saying, "Easy! Easy now. It's alright. I'm here now."

John looks at Mike in amazement and Mike only chuckles and says, "Yeah. He's always like that. The winking thing is new though. He doesn't usually do that." With one last smile, Mike leads a dazed John back outside to the front of the building. As they go their separate ways, John gets into a cab and stares blankly out the window. He feels his face twitch into a small smile as he nears his dismal flat. He is looking forward to the new possibilities that come with living with such a strange man.

As the sun sets that evening, John redialed the familiar number, letting it ring until he was met with Sherlock’s bored tone directing him to leave a message without being tiresome about it. When the beep sounded, John exhaled an obvious distressed sigh and began to speak, “Sherlock? Uh…listen… I-I didn’t mean what I said. Please…Please just come home. I don’t know how I can make this right, but I am willing to try. I’m so sorry, love. Please call me back. I love you.” If the guilt from before was bad, this was an entirely new beast. It gnawed at him until he had to grip the edge of the table to keep him from falling to the floor. Tears he had managed to keep at bay until this point slip past tightly closed lids and a shuddering sob escapes despite his best efforts to stifle it. ‘
March 31st, 1972 starts out like any other normal day. Marideth Watson knew that any day now she would be welcoming her second baby into the world, and she was so excited! As her contractions start, however, the excitement ebbs a bit. Today was the day. Geoffrey Watson had already prepared an overnight bag for Marideth, and their toddler named Harriet is staying with her grandmother. The two adults load into the car and Geoffrey makes the short trip to the hospital. Once there, doctors and nurses quickly grab a wheelchair and whisk Mrs. Watson away and into a room to check up on her periodically. Everything seemed to be going well. Everything seemed fine.
Just before the silence becomes awkward and unbearable, Sherlock blurts out, “If this is about last night, John, I promise you that I can move into 221C or I could move out.”
University wasn’t much better. When Sherlock sat down for his first lecture, an obnoxious man sat close by spouting off his latest sexual escapades. Sherlock took one look at the offending man and knew his life’s story. Sherlock quickly stands and spouts off, “Wrong! You are clearly lying! You have touched your noise nine times throughout your speech which indicates falsehood. There is also the fact that there is a white stain near the button of your trousers. I wonder what that could be!” He says sarcastically and filled with scorn. “You haven’t met your soulmate and I know that the only woman, or nurturing person, currently present in your life is your mother. I know that because your clothes have been ironed, tailored and washed, not by you, by a professional. It is possible that you go and get them professionally done, but there is a sentimental touch to each stitch. Ergo, mother. The girlfriend is an easy observation to make due to the fact that you have no one to seek from someone else. Obvious!”After Sherlock sits back down, the lecture hall explodes with laughter and jeers. Sebastian stands quickly and exits the room, but not before he can step up to Sherlock and menacingly whisper, “You will pay for this.”

"The day John Hamish Watson’s life began, his mother’s tragically ended."
Throughout Sherlock's little speech John's heart steadily sinks to the pit of his stomach. Along with the feeling of despair, comes the all consuming sense of rage. "Ignore them. Ignore them as if they don't matter?! That's
but, not unproductive. The first two weeks while John was away at the surgery, were spent furiously trying to find the perfect way to propose to his extraordinary blogger. He knew that he was an uneasy man to live with and wanted to make this the best he could so that his lovely doctor would say yes.
Special Thanks: QueenLadyAnne, my lovely Beta, who has stuck with me through thick and thin, and also to IBegToDreamAndDiffer for allowing me to use her marriage proposal setting . You are spectacular! (You can find it here: s/7798224/1/Sherlock-Platinum-On-Cobalt)
After the two men were officially married, the four men make their way to Angelo’s for the Reception Party. Once there, Sherlock and John link hands and walk through the door to greet their friends and family. To the newly wedded couple, the applause that greeted them was near deafening. Matching grins appear across two faces as they look at each other with unmasked adoration and love.
The shocked blogger sits staring blankly at his devoted detective, but after several long moments of silence pass, and Sherlock still hasn’t received an answer, he slowly gets to his feet and begins withdrawing in on himself. The discouraged detective slowly mumbles out, “It’s alright John. We don’t have to get married. We can forget all about it and---.” The loyal army doctor cuts his soulmate off by grabbing him by his hand and tugging him down onto his lap. Their foreheads touch and John, softly smiling, whispers against his threadmate’s lips, “Yes. You mad berk. Yes.” Sherlock doesn’t know who’s crying, but when the pair kiss, it’s watery and interrupted periodically with beaming smiles and small laughs of pure euphoria. After taking a cab back to Baker Street, the pair fall into bed together kissing languidly (which are broken just long enough to whisper terms of endearment between the infatuated pair before they come together again for another loving embrace).  Soon eyes grow heavy and the couple is snuggled closely together, sharing air and contented smiles.
The sleuth’s smile broadens as an idea pops into his head. He slowly extracts himself from the doctor’s loving embrace so that he can walk over to his IPod dock. He grabs the remote and presses play. When the music begins to softly play, the besotted ebony haired man walks over to his soulmate, smile spreading across his handsome face, and he gently grasps the doctor’s hands. “Our evening was cut short, but may I have this dance?”
The elevator makes its slow ascension up toward the desired room and when the small ding noise sounds, forty seconds later, John has already exited the small chamber, before the doors have even finished opening all the way.
When Sherlock sits back down, he quickly grabs a pillow and places it over his groin. When he has settled, John then proceeds to calm his flustered soul mate, "It's alright, love. It's a natural reaction. I'm glad I can make you feel good. Would you like some help with that? We would have to be careful. You haven't healed fully yet." The detective's face darkens into a deeper shade of red that seeps down his long neck and onto his chest. The army doctor gets a little distracted and is only draw out of blatant staring by Sherlock's stuttering reply of, "I-I don't know what to do John. I've never done this before and I'm not sure I'm ready to-to..."
War is absolutely hell. Hell doesn’t even begin to accurately describe all the pain, suffering, and grief he has felt at every death of each and every member of his team he has lost. At the age of 33, he has seen enough death and destruction to last a lifetime. Some nights he has trouble sleeping. He can still see each and every one of their faces. Each and every one begging God to end their suffering.
Verdigris eyes snap to sapphire blue as he incredulously replies, “Of course. Obviously.” The pair shares a small smile. John gently caresses one prominent cheekbone, gazes down at cupid bowed lips, looks back up at Sherlock, and quirks an eyebrow. Instead of answering, the detective slowly inches forward to place a chaste kiss against his blogger’s mouth. Mycroft, of course, decides at that moment to return.

When Sherlock grew to the age of thirteen there still was no red string present in his life. Of course everyone had noticed. His classmates would come up with ‘clever’ names to call him.
“No, John. That’s exactly what it is.” Sherlock gets up to storm into his room, but John grabs his hand to stop him. “No, Sherlock. Listen to me! I love you dearly. I didn’t say anything to that bloody twit because….well, I didn’t want to embarrass you, love. I heard what he was saying to you. In all honesty, I’m terrified that you’ll wake up one day and realize how boring I am. I’m an old man. I have scars and I’m just a beast. I’m not as young as I used to be. One day, I won’t be able to chase after criminals or jump across roof tops. You shine like the stars. You’re brilliant and bright and beautiful. In comparison to you, love, I’m so dull. I often times wonder what you see in me.”
Disclaimer: I don't own Sherlock.
“I know how lucky I am. You, who are good and kind and honorable, chose me! Now that I have the prospect of the rest of our lives with you, John, I hope I can show you how much I love you and how much I am grateful for you.” He raises his glass to propose one final toast but this is where John stands and grabs his arm. Sherlock, finally turning to see his mate, quickly becomes panicked when he sees the tears in John’s eye. Sherlock frantically inquires, “Not good? I tried really hard to say the right things. Did I do it wrong? I’m so so—.” John silences his flustered soulmate with a deep kiss, “You’re an idiot. You are brilliant and wonderful. I am so happy that you are mine. I love you very much.”
“I love you too.”

Speaking of his loyal blogger, where was he? He was sure he had specifically told him he was dying and needed nourishment! He looked around the room and saw his phone lying only inches away. Sherlock giggled again. Of course! The solution is so clear! If John wasn't here it was because he didn't receive any of the messages Sherlock sent. He picks up his phone, scrolls down to John's name, types out a text, and hits send.
"I know, love. I love you too."
When they finally reached the hospital, Sherlock was whisked away in a flurry of barked orders and surgical masks. John watched them disappear down the long white hallway until they turned a corner and lost sight of them. With nothing else he could do, John sat down on the cold plastic chairs to await the doctor's prognosis. Mycroft arrived, 15 minutes later, carrying his black umbrella in a clenched fist. Nothing was said for the next hour until the doctor arrived with his news.
He picks up the last photo before turning back to Lestrade and saying, "The killer is the type to parade in front of family members, pretend to be grieving over the loss of such a talented woman, but is secretly joyful and giddy. Her hatred and resentment for the three women, grew until she just couldn't stand it anymore. Our killer doesn't have a talent. No one believes she will ever really amount to anything. She finally broke one night when Brianna had called to tell her the exciting news. She was getting accepted into an animation studio which was her dream job. Alicia is your killer. She drove over and killed her after having an argument about said job in which Alicia wanted her to decline. She had already killed her younger sister and mother, one more wouldn't have made a difference." Brianna's father steps angrily forward at the accusation against his middle child but stops when he saw Alicia's face.
John quietly walks up to Sherlock's door and gently knocks. "Sherlock?" No answer. He tries again, and still, no answer. At this point he begins to worry so he says a quick, silent apology and opens the door. Inside, on the bed, lays a disheveled looking Sherlock that is facing away from John, toward the wall, curled in on himself. Again, he is slightly shaking but this time John can hear almost inaudible gasps of anguish. John is quickly at his side in an instant. He runs a shaking hand through inky black, tangled curls in an attempt at comforting his troubled love. Instead of questioning Sherlock again, he eases Sherlock up and into his lap where he gently rocks them back and forth, all the while making 'shushing' noises between frequent kisses to the top of Sherlock's head.

,’ a voice not unlike John’s taunts the distraught man.
But I believe in you.
Is the first thought that runs chillingly through his mind. He rushes forward and sees the slumped over detective curled in on himself with the bloody knife resting loosely in his hand. On his forearm the word
John was in a state of panic. Someone from St. Mary’s called a few minutes ago and just informed him that Sherlock was in the hospital. A few years ago, the pair decided that they would make the other their emergency contact. Sherlock saw no need to add Mycroft—he would always be the first to know anyway—and John knew Harry did not care. The inseparable two were like family anyway, so it was only the most logical step to take. Now, as John sat in a cab, racing toward St. Mary’s, he was so glad that Sherlock had not had the time to change the information. When Sherlock left with Mycroft, John knew it would be nearly impossible to find the ebony haired man unless the elder Holmes wanted him to be found. While he was relieved to know where Sherlock was, he was concerned about the detective’s safety.
Okay, so I have a confession.
With a little persuading, John manages to get two weeks leave from his commanding officer to take care of a personal issue at home. When his feet finally touched English soil, he immediately traveled to Harry and Clara’s home to see about his sister. Harriet…was not doing well. Clara’s face is twisted in agony as she takes in her wife’s disheveled and pale face. As soon as Harriet saw her little brother, she giggled madly, rushed forward to envelop her Johnnie in a tight embrace, but missed and stumbled over her own feet. She giggled once more as John caught her around the waist to steady her, and as she raised her head, John noticed her pupils were the size of pinpricks.
The morning dawns quickly and four men get ready for this important day. When each man has put on their special suits, Mycroft and Sherlock head down to Baker Street to pick up their separate threadmates. When the wedded pair sees the other, two sets of gasps can be heard.
Everything for John suddenly slams to an abrupt stop. His heart lurches in his chest as he takes in the other man’s quiet words. How anyone, especially John himself, could think Sherlock as being a cold machine is beyond John’s comprehension. He regrets ever insinuating that he ever believed it to be true. But no more. This would end today. John sits down in front of the detective on the coffee table and prepares himself for the discussion that needed to happen from the beginning.
Sherlock.
"Sorry?"
“You’re become repetitive...or don’t you remember? What was it that he said again? Right.” She clears her throat and suddenly her face morphs into something dark as she shouts, “THAT’S WHAT PEOPLE
John, oddly enough, gets his wish granted as the man suggests viewing a flat together. From there John's doubt quickly turns into amazement as the odd man before him dissects his past and reads him like an open book. "We don't know a thing about each other. I don't know where we're meeting. I don't even know your name." Before the man leaves he enters the room again and exclaims, "The name's Sherlock Holmes and the address is 221b Baker Street. Afternoon." He winks and then he is gone.
Everything was not fine.
The detective looks his soulmate with unmasked adoration and love as he replies, “Yes, I’ll see you tomorrow.” They share one last kiss and separate. Sherlock squares his shoulders and walks back with John to the living room. Mycroft looks up and says, “Are you ready to go?” Sherlock tersely nods, turns to John, places a sweet kiss against his cheek, and then he is gone. Lestrade smiles at John apologetically, “I’m sorry, John. You know how the Holmeses can be.” John laughs, “Eh, that I do, and no worries. We can make it one night.”

"I don't know how to propose to John."
I wanted them to talk about the scars. As far as I know season four didn't give us a lot of things INCLUDING the scars. We know he's disfigured. WE KNOW. But they didn't talk about it, so I did. I was tired of that. That's part of the reason why this is not season four compliant. The only thing good we received was The Hug. That's it. Everything else was just painful and I was so sorry for my child (Sherlock, if you didn't know). I'm still upset about it. So anyway, that's why it's not season four compliant. I had several ideas about what season four was going to be like AND IT WAS NONE OF THOSE THINGS. I'm moving on before this get's any longer. Goodness...
Both men beam with pride as John says, “Thank you, Mrs. Holmes. I can happily say, that I don’t expect any less. Sherlock and John eventually move away to meet a few more well-wishers and after a few more loving hugs and claps on the back, the newly sit together at their signature table and everyone else files in around them. A waiter appears from the back to adorn the Watson-Holmes table with a single candle. John smiles and reaches across the table and takes his husband’s hand, “I am so happy that you’re mine. Thank you for today.”
I know, I know...I'm awful. If you're interested, though, I am currently writing a short little happy fic that I will post directly after my beta and I look over chapter 6. You'll have to wait a bit for chapter 6, though... It's REALLY long and I had to break it up into two parts (while I'm thinking on it, posting is going to be tricky from now on because I am back in University and updating between my many classes will be difficult. ANYWAY, back to before, if you're interested, I'm going to be writing a short (maybe just over 1,000 words) story to counteract all the sadness you're about to receive. I've told you before...It gets REALLY bad before it gets better. However, I promise you, that it WILL get better. I'm never going to lead you on about it. It will be official here. They love each other and they will always love each other (if you can't tell, I'm a little bitter. My apologies). Anyway, my lovelies, I will see you next chapter :). I love you all very much and I hope you have a very wonderful day/night, whereever you are. Happy reading!
He flips past the first twenty pages, and nestled among the hollowed crevices, lies a little black box containing one final dosage of Apathy. He quickly rolls up his sleeves, takes his belt, tightens the makeshift tourniquet, and inject the needle into a vein without any hint of hesitation. He just needs the pain to stop for a little while. He won’t become addicted again. He can handle it this time. He just needs to forget for a little while.
John then lays back down and begins a slow rhythm of skin on skin drawing small moans out of both participants. Sherlock reaches over into the top drawer of the small nightstand and retrieves a satchel of lube.

Sherlock had been fighting so hard these last two years to come home. He hadn't meant to be gone for so long, but Moriarty's web had stretched all across the globe. He would have given up so long ago if he hadn't had someone to come home to. '
John suddenly realizes how perfect this scene is. The light of the setting sun highlights his sleeping husband’s face in a way that makes him look so peaceful. John’s right hand is currently clasped in the detective’s left, and ever so often; Sherlock’s grip would subconsciously tighten as if to make sure that John was still there. He is on his way to Turin, Italy to celebrate his marriage to this dazzling man. The blogger can’t help but smile at this ideal scene.
If John didn't know Sherlock, he would have smiled and basked in the sentimental words Sherlock had just spoken, but, John knows Sherlock. He knows the detective is only trying to divert the conversation.

Sherlock and John finally meet
John softly smiles at the aging detective before quietly whispering, "No. I needed him. He's the best thing I never knew I needed. When we first met, I had no idea when we first met how important he would become to me. He's my whole world. He brought me back to life and gave me a reason to live when I had given up. I owe him so much. I need him with me always." The only reply John receives from the DI is a firm embrace before the sentimental man leaves the flat with one last departing nod. John then travels back up the stairs to rejoin Sherlock on the sofa. "What did George want?"
So, this is sad, I know. It seems like things aren't going to turn out well. I know it feels likes some stories just won't end the way you want them to, but, I promise you, that things will be alright. Even now, I'm so distraught over season 4, episode 3 did not end with Johnlock, but I am so proud and happy to be a part of such a wonderfully incredible community that sticks toghether and creates our own endings. You'll get this happy ending. I always want to reassure you of that, and because I am gay myself that means that I plan to continue to strive for more LGBT content, even if I have to create that content myself. Sorry. I've been thinking A LOT lately about a lot of things and it spilled over here. I'll get on to the notes. ^_^;
This was basically me working out some of my personal demons. On a related note, if you ever feel like Sherlock, please talk to someone. Always keep fighting, everyone. You are important. I love you all.
The child-like detective’s eyes continue to shine as he quietly tries to say, “But you said—,” before John interrupts, “I know what I said, Sherlock, but I didn’t mean it. You are the most precious thing in this world to me, and for making you feel like otherwise will forever haunt me. You are brilliant, love.” The younger man blushes at the familiar praise, but looks away with an air of melancholy as he says, “It’s okay, John. You don’t have to try and make me feel better. I’ve always known that I am a freak. It was wrong of me to assume otherwise.”
I LIVE! I'm so, so, so, so, so, sososososososososo Sorry! I've been gone for nearly a year! Are any of you still out there? I am terribly sorry, guys. :( If I may offer an excuse, I do have one... So, this past year was my senior year in high school. It was extremely hectic and crazy. I had to prepare myself for college. That was also time consuming and extremely tedious. For those who don't know, I was extremely depressed and suicidal for a long time. A friend of mine (who I happened to be in love with at the time) told me to go commit suicide (he knows that I have trouble with that, by the way), and it really, really set me back a lot. Between getting ready for college and being in emotional turmoil, my life has (to repeat the word) really, really hectic. I hope you all can forgive me! I love you all! I wrote a whole bunch for you all! I double my word count! I hope this helps in the forgiveness process? Anyway, on to the actual notes...

John's face has taken on that blank, emotionless mask he has perfected these last two years. "Why didn't you come back when the snipers had been taken care of?"
Sherlock Holmes, though, does it,” John’s voice escalates until it seems various picture frames shake on the walls.

, unable to do anything as he watched the love of his life, crumble to the ground. He watched as Sherlock, with a sickening thud, lay bloody and broken at the steps of St. Barts. It took only a moment before John was running to Sherlock's side. When he was only a fourth of the way from his broken detective, a cyclist crashed into him sending him tumbling to the cold pavement.
Anyway, I'll stop now before I get weepy. I hope you enjoyed this story, and as always, Happy reading!
The man before him, who has always appeared so sure and confident now stands unsure, fiddling with his hands, waiting for the blogger to say something. When the silence weighs too heavily on the consulting detective's shoulders, he begins to ramble useless nonsense. When John steps forward, on slight uneven steps, Sherlock's maundering speech comes to an abrupt end.
Minutes later, the worried army doctor's phone pings several times, indicating to him that he has received messages.

When Sherlock falls silent, John takes a moment to compose himself. He slowly lifts his head from his shaking hands and stares pointedly at Sherlock. John lets out a shaky breath and whispers,"I would like to know what the hell you were thinking.""
At this point, he has earned the title of Captain of the Fifth Northumberland Fusiliers. It was on one mission that everything changed. John was kneeling down to patch up a fallen, wounded soldier, when suddenly a burning, white-hot, searing pain spreads throughout his entire body, radiating from his shoulder. As his vision slowly begins to fade, he hears shouting in the distance and running footfalls. His last, conscious thought is, ‘
What was the point anymore? Why continue to fight when there truly was no point now. The emptiness was all consuming. What does it matter?
"The self-loathing only mounted as he realized that John was right. He was a freak... A machine... A monster. "
The doctor released a breath he hadn’t realized he had been holding as he brings his hand up, the rest of the way, to rest on his detective’s cheek. Sherlock’s eyes flutter closed at the contact and he leans forward to place a soft kiss against his threadmate’s lips. When the brief contact is broken, Sherlock murmurs, “I love you too.” John’s entire body sags with relief. “Thank God! I thought I had lost you. I hope you can forgive me, love.”
Sherlock and Mycroft retire at the government’s posh flat. For the first few hours they remained relatively silent. Sherlock lay on his brother’s couch in his signature thinking pose. Mycroft had just sat in his favorite chair with a piece of cake when the silence is finally broken.
John was always a courageous little boy and at the age of eight he decided to “Go on an adventure!” He packed a small bag with some clothes, crisps, biscuits, and juice to follow his red thread. He told his mother and father of his plans and they bit back smiles and told him that they would come with him to ‘help him search’. They followed the thread for a few blocks until John got tired, and a bit discouraged, and reluctantly agreed to head home with a heavy heart.
Mycroft now understands. His heart, that he was often told was inexistent, twinges painfully for his little brother as he remembers a younger Sherlock, barely the age of 8, tearfully question what was wrong with him, and why he didn’t have a red thread of his own. Perhaps that is why Mycroft stands and gently grabs Sherlock’s arm to comfort his little brother. The British government speaks softly as he says, “Brother mine, John loves you. He has loved you for a long time. I have seen it before you fell and every day after. Tomorrow, you will get married and he
When the song ends, the flat is plunged into silence once more.

“This was such a fun game, wasn’t it, Sherlock? You played it so poorly, you know. You’ve become so spineless, so weak, so...
He finds himself enjoying life and preening under praise.
As soon as the bullet makes contact, Alarm bells sound inside his mind as Mary slips away unnoticed. He only has a few chances at survival, but even if he executes these strategies perfectly, he will still probably die. Murdered by the woman he promised to protect in order to keep John happy. None of that matters now, does it? As he falls on his back he quickly recognizes the first signs of shock and he begins to desperately search his Mind Palace for anything to calm himself down. ‘I’m being put down, too,’ Sherlock thinks as Redbeard ambles toward him gleefully. He continues onward, but Jim Moriarty is the next to visit him. Softly Moriarty begins to chant of Sherlock’s inevitable death. It wasn’t until his next words that Sherlock begins trying to desperately claw his way back to life, “John will cry buckets and buckets. It’s him that I worry about the most. That
He rushes out again, through his bedroom door,
On the first night, he was plagued with nightmares; each horrid dream was played on a constant, endless loop of Sherlock’s agonized face. When the second day came and went, John began calling, searching frequently visited places, and asking around if anyone had seen the detective, but came up empty handed. John called the ebony haired man’s phone for the one-hundredth time that evening without getting an answer. The nightmares never ceased and as John watched the sun rise on the third day, he finally swallowed his pride and called Mycroft Holmes.
I hate to do this and I apologize.... I'm going to have to update now on Wednesday and Saturday. I'm working on getting the updates done but I'm not sure I can do it for Monday. (again, sorry!)
' "I came back to
"Love, I'm not going anywhere." John says as he brushes away the tears that are falling from beautiful verdigris eyes. Sherlock, though, seems to only cry harder before replying brokenly with, "You are now, but you'll leave! You always leave. I thought that when I could finally come home, you'd be happy. You asked me to come back. I've been so alone." The melancholy detective has briefly stopped crying but this possibly is much worse. He seems to be lost in his own head, eyes staring blankly at the bland wall, reliving his own twisted past.
“You may not be asking for forgiveness, but I will freely give it to you.”
“Yes, John.”
“John,” Mary whispers urgently.
’ the army doctor thought. He turned to the young detective and gave him a soft smile before glaring at Sergeant Donovan and Anderson, “Excuse me, Sally, but judging by the state of your clothes and knees, it appears to me that you’ve been doing more than just scrubbing New Scotland Yard’s floors. What would Lestrade say if he knew that two of the

"Then you are a fool…"
More notes at the end of Chapter.
After Mary died, and John was left to raise a child all on his own, he returned to Baker Street expecting Sherlock to kick him right back out again, but his friend only blinked, called him an idiot, and uncharacteristically helped John move his and Rosie’s belongings back up to his old room. Things are halted and awkward, though. Things are quiet and
But on one sunny day in January, Mrs. Hudson calls him and asks him to remove some of Sherlock's old book. So, with a heavy footsteps and heart, John travels once again to 221B Baker Street. When the cab drops him off at the front of the building, he reaches one shaky hand forward, turns the doorknob, opens the door, and continues up the stairs to the familiar flat. Instead of a cheery Mrs. Hudson, he sees a man that invade his dreams nightly and was said to be dead. "Hello John."
The now agitated amateur detective sits beside his mate once more to envelope him in a possessive cuddle. Mycroft smirks at Sherlock’s futile efforts before declaring, “It’s tradition, Sherlock. The Holmes family has practiced this particular tradition for over 100 years. You can’t break it now.”
Sherlock begins to explain how exactly he knew how to turn off the bomb, and just as he finishes, the former blogger can hear police sirens overhead. John turns disbelieving eyes on the other man and threatens without heat, “Oh, I’m definitely going to kill you.” Sherlock’s mirth never falters as he states, “Oh please! Killing me? That was
The once self-assured, confident, ebony haired man has now been reduced to a sniveling, crying mess on the hardwood floors. He doesn’t know how long he sits there, but when he does stand again, his feet have gone numb and his face feels tight where the tears have dried on his cheeks. He buries his hands into thick curls and pulls to try and ground himself before he is walking swiftly into the bedroom and over to the bookshelf sitting in the corner. He pulls down a copy of
John’s smile turns soft as he gently replies, “Yeah. ‘

You dismantled my web of A.E.s and Synthetic emotions!” Her demeanor changes once more as she throws her arms out wide and proudly declares, “It’s me, Sherlock. I’m Moriarty. Hi!!” He stares at her is clear disbelief as he tries to stutter out a denial, but she quickly grows tired of his utterings, rolls her eyes, and states, “Oh, really, is that so hard to believe? We both know I’m extremely brilliant. Don’t you remember the last time you were here? I was standing right on that ledge over there,” she points to the wall Sherlock is facing to proudly point out where she stood. “I was the one pointing the gun at your dear John’s chest. Remember that? How does it feel to know, that you and John were the ones to ever occupy the same room as me and live to talk about it? Really, it’s such an honor. But enough of pleasantries,” she suddenly becomes serious, her eyes turn to ice, “Mommy’s had enough, Sherlock. I want your answer now. Who do you choose?  Brilliant me or boring John?”

The blogger’s shoulders sag as the anger that once burned so intently leaves as quickly as it appeared. Confusion quickly overtakes him; however, as he gazes down at the consulting detective’s once proud frame. The confident, hard lines of Sherlock’s body are gone and they leave behind this fragile creature in their place. A shocked, “What did you say?” now hangs between the pair.

With two perfectly made teas in each hand, he takes both mugs out of the kitchen and into the living room in which he sets Sherlock's on the coffee table in front of him and gently helps the consulting detective up. When that has been accomplished, John sits in his own chair and sips his tea. Two sets of eyes gaze into the other, in a silent inquiry of 'Now what?'
John knows everything, so, what will he do now?
Sherlock’s eyes blink rapidly for several long seconds before he sucks in a sharp breath, face guarded but his eyes are full of hope as he haltingly asks, “W-what do you mean by that? You know you are always welcome here.”
,’ he thought, ‘
Despite countless days of reassurance and months of whispered apologies after each and every nightmare, Sherlock could not stop his reactions, no matter how illogical he found them. John noticed. Of course he did, but he would not comment on them. He would get this sad, guilty look in his eyes that proclaimed a deep regret that had been uttered too many times to count. It was four months later that everything changed.
The short version of this is that I am Moriarty. I tortured him in Siberia and sent him back home to you to be tortured to find us happily in love and moved on,” she says this in a high pitched, mocking voice and she gestures with the needle before placing it back at the crook of the detective’s elbow.
"Who was the first?"
One grief-filled month later, John was finally discharged out of the hospital with orders to visit a psychiatrist, but, what is he to do now? He has no purpose, no family, no life here in London. He has nothing anymore.
before his thread decided
"Hello love, how was your day?"
John’s face tightens as she says this, but his attention is immediately drawn to Sherlock as he begins slowly waking up. A soft, pitiful, “John,” escapes as he begins to stir. Mary cackles viciously and claps her hands together gleefully, “Oh, splendid! The gang’s all here! Sherlock, wake up, dear. Wouldn’t want to miss the party now, would we?”
Increasingly alarmed now, John panics and inquires, “Harry? Clara, what’s wrong?! What happened?”
So, John returns back to the military and school to further pursue his career as an army surgeon. After he finishes all of his courses, he is finally a certified military physician. After the small ceremony concludes, his commander comes up to him to talk about shipping him off to Afghanistan for the next 8 years. John, excitingly agrees. He doesn’t know what will happen in that time period, but he is extremely happy with all of the doors that have opened up for him.

John warily climbs the stairs that lead up and into 221B. He is not looking forward to the unavoidable row that will only likely to ensue from their conversation at the hospital. As he approaches the door, he notices that it is slightly ajar and his past training kicks in. He climbs the rest of the way silently and enters through the door. The sight before him makes his blood run cold.
The thought comes to John after the fifth flash of dark curls that quickly turn around and go in the opposite direction than originally intended. At first John had thought Sherlock had been on a case. It was common for Sherlock to disappear throughout the course of the day and then return at ungodly hours only to torture his violin, but John began to notice the lack of a sprawled out detective on the sofa, or case notes cluttering the coffee table.
So, I know last chapter I said it would be wedding time... I lied a bit. I started thinking of how cool it would be to write in a Stag Night... The story began writing itself and I got swept away with a certain idea. Next chapter is definitely wedding (and possibly honeymoon). :)
Wilkes looks at the amateur detective and laughs, “See! I was right.” John purses his lips as Sebastian continues, “We were at Uni together. Had this trick he used to do. He could take one look at you and know whom you had slept with and what you had for breakfast.” Sherlock, eyes still downcast, quietly murmurs, “ It’s not a trick.” Sebastian carries on as if Sherlock never spoke: “We all thought he was threadless back then… Oh, you poor bloke. I fear what you must go through every day!”
Sherlock joyfully thinks to himself, '
John could feel the butterflies threatening to wage war on his insides at what Sherlock’s words could imply. However, the detective’s reaction is…off. ‘
Mycroft finally lets the all-knowing facade fall away and lets the confusion consume his facial expression. "And you think I do?!"
Said blogger heaves a put upon sigh and takes two mugs down for tea. "Sherlock, I've already told you that you do not have to go. I'm not going to make you go." The amateur detective goes into the kitchen, stands beside his threadmate, crosses his arms, and pouts. "I just don't see the point in getting utterly sloshed to have a good time. Nor do I understand the idea of hiring some exotic dancer to entertain us for the evening."
John doesn't come back home. Sherlock begins thinking the worst.
John visits Sherlock in the hospital.

Other than an absence of her pregnant belly, she looks perfectly fine. Her face and eyes, however, are dark and malicious as she looks wickedly at the doctor as she states, “This is quite a turn up, isn’t it?” She walks forward—her body nearly flush against the detective’s back—her footsteps echoing off the walls, “We’re here again, aren’t we? I just knew you would come if I called, John. You’re just so

controlling the rest), and transferred him into a new school. There he used his massive intellect to annoy the teachers proving himself right (on many multiple occasions) and uncovering the lies he saw around school. Things were going good until he met Victor Trevor. Victor Trevor was the most popular boy at the university. Victor could talk to anyone, and he was extremely handsome. When he looked Sherlock's way, Sherlock felt his insides flutter. Sherlock found himself aiming to please him. He would go out of his way to make Victor Smile. They eventually got together. Victor made Sherlock believe that he was loved. Unfortunately, Victor was using Sherlock.
As they travel home, Moriarty's morbid threat hangs heavily on their minds.
It took Sherlock another week to get John to allow Sherlock out of the flat in order to ‘see Molly’. When they are in the cab heading to St. Barts, Sherlock receives a text from his older brother.
Without warning, Sherlock goes to dive out of his chair, but Mary catches him around the middle and shifts with his body weight, remaining behind the detective the entire time as they both land on the concrete floor. John can’t get a clear shot and she knows it. She laughs maniacally and states, “Oh, boys. I know that trick. That won’t work with me, dear.”

Sherlock thinks with a smirk), and the overly dramatic actors, the show didn't have much going for it. The only thing Sherlock found the least bit entertaining would be the horrid acting. The way the leading actress threw herself at any man with male genitalia was quite hilarious. Sherlock gets the opportunity he was hoping for when the ditzy blonde woman, who was pregnant with the leading man's child and was cheating on her current boyfriend, gets proposed to her by said idiotic boyfriend.
The D.I. turns to the British government and sighs, “You see? I told you that they wouldn’t agree.” Mycroft smirks, “Oh, I knew that they wouldn’t agree, however, Sherlock should know that Mummy would be very disappointed if she knew that he broke tradition. We both know that we can’t let Mummy down. Plus, “ here Mycroft grins haughtily, “you owe me, Sherlock. We don’t want John to--.”
The tears that had been threatening to spill, spill past tightly clenched eyes,

His parents quickly explained that he was a

.’ The amateur detective then picks up the deceased man’s hand, checks under the man’s fingernails, and unbuttons the man’s shirt and notices what appears to be almost 200 scars littering the man’s ribs and stomach, some old and others fresh. Lastly, he opens the victim’s mouth and smells inside.
John's eye, of course, widen when he hears the small stuttered request (some other part of his anatomy, which had already been affected by the heated snogging, also shows an interest in the conversation), but Sherlock continues before John can say anything, "Nothing sexual. I don't think..I'm not sure I'm ready for any of that, but…I would enjoy your company tonight." Sherlock's hands twitch while he waits for a response. When John has failed to reply, after several moments of shocked staring, Sherlock had taken his silence as a denial.
Maybe that is why John soon finds himself inside Baker Street, months later, about to ask Sherlock the big question. Today is the big day! Today he is going to ask Sherlock to be his best man.
Each soul is connect by a single red thread that never breaks and would cause extreme heartache to the soul’s whose mates died. The thread wearers were connected to the one soul that they would always belong to, or fit perfectly with. Many swore to never love again after their mate had died and threads slowly disappeared  The threads weren’t physical, you couldn’t touch them but they were seen and felt by the heart. When a child is born, and the red thread is clearly visible, it is a time for celebration because the threads mostly develop at a later age. Everyone could see their threads.
But that wasn’t to be the case. Both of his children were too young to understand why their father only seemed to have two moods, anger and grief. It was two months later that Mr. Watson first lay hands on the two siblings. While Harriet got the brunt of harsh words, John seemed to take most of the physical violence. The children just do not understand why hands that are supposed to wipe away tears are causing them so much pain. Father's aren't supposed to do this, right? Was this normal?
“Is that all I am to you?” Something cold settles along John’s spine. Sherlock raises empty eyes toward the doctor, “A colleague?” To John’s horror, Sherlock’s eyes fill with tears. “They’ve told me all my life that I am nothing. I was told that I would never have anyone, that I would always be alone…but I had you. Now I see that they were right. How idiotic I’ve been.” Here, Sherlock blinks away his tears and he barks out a self-depreciative laugh. “How could I have been so blind?”
Sherlock turns to John and incredulously questions, “What the hell am I supposed to do with that?!” The blogger smiles and kisses the younger man on the cheek, “Nothing, love. Now, come on. Let’s get out of here.
John has never seen anything as sexy as the man currently grinding his hip into the blogger’s thigh. After a moment of brief hesitation, John undulates his hips in time with the music; it becomes evident that the mutual stimulation burns a slow build of arousal through the thredmates’ veins. When the song ends both men are panting and each need a moment to adjust themselves.
And he hears a familiar sound again that he always seems to be able to discern.
’ John can see that now. Sherlock is absolutely terrified of what John will say, but above that, he’s afraid of what he believes John will inevitably do. He doesn't want to watch John go because he knows he may never see John again if he walks through that door. Sherlock can't bear to watch as his heart is broken again.
"John Watson had always known he was intended to have a soul mate. He was one of the few very fortunate children that had their red threads at an early age. Everyone in his family knew that he was a special child. Unlike most children, John’s thread was a crimson, fiery red that burned intently and endlessly."
When he receives this message, John can feel his heart aching for the childlike detective.
The detective looks around the room and notices that they are almost out of John's favorite tea, so he walks over to the refrigerator and takes in account of how much milk they have. The carton is at least half full.
I'm so sorry that I'm so late in posting! I've been going through a lot recently and fortunately, I've just got out of school. Thank you for being patient with me. I'm already working on chapter 17.  I hope that I can get it up soon. I hope you like it!
John feels like he's going to be sick. He looks down at the pale, thin arm and takes them all in. '

The lanky detective wakes up with a soft groan as he stretches his long limbs and turns sleepy eyes on his beloved and he whispers out a warm, “Hello, John.” The blogger answers with his own whispered greeting against his husband’s lips as he places loving kisses on soft cupid bows. Sherlock withdraws and pulls out one of the pamphlets Mycroft had given them.

John finds his own voice at the age of fifteen. Maybe he heard a story in school about a dashing hero, a protector of those who could not protect themselves, or maybe he was just tired of all the abuse. Regardless of the why, when Mr. Watson raised his hand to hurt Harry in a fit of rage, John quickly dashed between the two, raises two striking, dark blue eyes up at their father in defiance, and brandishes an imaginary shield in an attempt to protect his older sister. In Mr. Watson's rage, he strikes John's outstretched arm too hard and an audible pop is barely heard over John's agonized cry. Tears immediately spring to the fifteen-year old's eyes as the skin begins to rapidly swell and bruise. Realizing his mistake, Mr. Watson become acutely aware of his sobbing sixteen and fifteen-year-old children huddled together, one in fear and the other in pain as they try their best to look as small as possible.

Before John gets a chance to answer Sherlock continues, "I could clearly deduce that you had no intention of returning to the flat. In a normal situation, you would have stayed by my side, no matter what I had said. Your rigid frame and cold tone told me as much. I can only conclude that you had returned for the rest of your things."
. He picked up a hairbrush and threw it at the mirror. The glass shattered and the broken pieces landed on the counter and the floor. With tears running down his face, he picked up a shard, looked at it briefly, before putting it against his skin and made a small cut along the inside of his wrist. He Didn't regret it. In fact, he thought that it had felt
The day started out relatively normal. John had awoken to ebony curls tickling his nose and a comfortable weight settled along his right side. The blogger smiled and pressed a gentle kiss against the detective’s lax forehead. He slowly extracted himself from Sherlock’s constricting grasp and made his way to the kitchen to make his usual morning cuppa. He opened the refrigerator, took out the milk, but quickly discovered something odd about the liquid inside the plastic jug—or the solid mass that should have been milk. Somehow, the milk had solidified into a plastic-like substance with the same milky exterior. John angrily threw the milk away and decided to calm down with a nice cup of coffee instead, which would have been fine if there weren’t eyeballs in the microwave. John blew out a slow breath to calm himself down. ‘
When Sherlock falls silent, John takes a moment to compose himself. He slowly lifts his head from his shaking hands and stares pointedly at Sherlock. John lets out a shaky breath and whispers,"I would like to know what the hell you were thinking." Sherlock sat in dumb silence as he stared at his beloved Blogger.
The blogger blinks up at the detective for a moment before standing, knocking Sherlock off balance, and saying, "I think I'll sleep in my own room tonight." Sherlock stands too, stretching before saying, "I'll come with you. I've not slept in… three days? That sounds right... After about 30 hours pass, the time spent awake becomes a bit hazy." John had taken a few steps before rounding on the detective that was following closely behind him before furiously proclaiming, "You sleep in your

There are only about two more chapters left and then Red will be over! If you all will stick with me, I have a series taking hold in my mind and it's begging to be written.
Special Warning: Mary fans beware.
"Hey, Sherlock, you okay?" John says before he heads to the entrance of St. Barts. "Turn around and walk back the way you came now." Sherlock's frantic plea makes him pause momentarily before he redoubles his efforts, "No, I'm coming in."
Honestly, I'm not entirely sure about this chapter. I always wanted Mary to be shot by John. That was so important to me. I wanted that to be the ultimate "I pick you," moments. I hope that was conveyed. I had a certain amount of enjoyment while writing this chapter. I hope you do too. As always, happy reading!
Somehow, that’s how they find themselves here, in the London Underground trying desperately to defuse a bomb which only has 2:30 to go. Sherlock has no idea what to do. He’s never defused a bomb before. He begins frantically searching his Mind Palace for any relevant information that could lead to saving their lives. He comes up empty handed. The Consulting Detective turns sad, defeated eyes on his dear friend and softly says, “I’m so sorry. I-I can’t do it, John. I don’t know how.” Sherlock’s eyes begin to fill with tears as he continues, “Forgive me? Please, John, forgive me for all the hurt that I caused you.”

"Sherlock, you do realize when I said what I had said, that I was rambling, and didn't really mean what I was saying, don't you?"

I had started spouting random things from the top of my head."
himself that he wouldn't resort to this again, yet here he is, putting pressure on the thin long lines across his wrist. He briefly wonders how he will hide this from Mycroft, because now that Mycroft knows of his past afflictions, he will be on high alert to changes in Sherlock's behavior. He bandages his wrist, packs away the rest of his clothes (along with his blades at the bottom of his bag), and lays down for a brief nap before he has to get up and greet the driver who will take him back to the Holmes' Manor.
? Did you drug them, torture them to make them stay? You've must've done something. No one would willingly stay with you for over ten seconds let alone a lifetime. The only reason John stays with you is because he pities you." Anderson laughs before taking over Donovan's cruel words, "Aw, look at the sad little pretend detective! He doesn't even have any friends!"
In Clara’s letter, John reads of Harry’s self-destruction and alcoholism. The distraught Clara details how she put Harriet through several courses of rehab with the promise of success only for Harriet to relapse a month later. An ultimatum was then given: Clara or the booze. Surprisingly, Harriet stopped drinking. She promised not to touch the stuff, and so far, she had been truthful. The problem now lies in the fact that Harriet is now taking artificial emotions.
Sherlock and John have a Stag Night.

In 1935, W. L. Hopper rethought the original idea and created a safer device that focused on one particular emotion at a time to efficiently extract the feeling. Instead of throwing away all of the discarded and unwanted emotions, people with mental illness demanded access to the positive feelings. In 1939, Pathogens Incorporated bought out the production of the bottled emotions and by 1945, injectable and artificial emotions were finally approved by the government and could be purchased by the general public. The people, who willingly gave away their emotions, quickly demanded payment for their service, and for a while, this was a wonderful system. Suicide rates plummeted for those with defective, mental illnesses, the economy was enriched with this new business, the monetary value of money rose dramatically, and those who did not want their emotions would not feel anything after each extraction. Bottling emotions were a great success.
However, just below the surface of all the activist groups trying to shut down Pathogen Inc., there began a whisper. Just the barest hint of a sound. Suddenly, there was a spike in Artificial Emotion usage, but how could this be? The machines were destroyed. Schematics burned in the fires. Police officers are completely baffled. An Underground Ring seemed to spring up overnight, but no one could get to the leader. This vast web of individualized networks seemed to spread across the globe in a matter of hours. Who was this mysterious person? What was their end game? Most importantly, what could be done to stop them?

Notes: I'm sick. I'm so sick that I've been in bed all day. I'm sorry this is so short but, I feel so bad and I just finished this today and my lovely beta had to actually get this story out of me. She beta'd fortunately just in time (Again, thank you Anne :D). I'll try and answer all the comments Saturday. I'll talk to you all Saturday. I'm going back to bed. :/

When the rings do arrive, Sherlock receives a text from Mycroft that says he will be visiting sometime later that day. John is currently wrapped tightly around the excited detective and has yet to be roused. Sherlock slowly extracts himself from John's warm embrace and makes his way to the kitchen.
"Hmm?"
why they’re here.  “No,” Sherlock plainly states as he goes back to sit beside his confused threadmate.
. If he were completely honest, he would admit that the last one hurt the most. It was just another reminder that he was different.
What’s worse is that John promised Sherlock that nothing would change, but obviously, everything has. There have been no cases, no late-night chases, no cancelled plans at the last minute because, “A suspect is getting away,
Both men would have to agree that the first two weeks of Sherlock's recovery had been truly wonderful.
of the milk?"
feel the same way, then they don’t need to waste any more time. He’s not getting any younger and Sherlock is just beginning to grey around his temples. They can’t keep living this way, balanced on the edge of something
Seems to be the recurring thought for John as he lay, just like the soldier previously, bleeding out. Just before he loses consciousness, his red thread flickers. Once...twice…..and then fades away as if it had never been present. For the first time in twelve years, John’s eyes well up and the tears slip past tightly shut lids as he silently mourns his loss. He’s crying silently…...when one cries silently it's because they just can't stop.
This fanfiction is nearly over! It's about two more chapters (I think?). I am so very proud of this story. It was so fun to write and I had a great time :).
John, having grown accustomed to a Holmes’ wrath, squares his shoulders, ever the captain, and replies, “You told me to make it right. That’s why I’m

Thank you to:
Another wave of guilt envelops John as he blinks back tears, “I understand, love. I want you to understand something too…you will never, and I mean NEVER, lose me. I will always love you. That will never change. You’re stuck with me, I’m afraid.” Sherlock nods, smiles, and places a loving kiss on his threadmate’s head.
Once that was completed, Sherlock carefully flops down onto the couch, places his hands under his chin in a prayer-like fashion and closes his eyes. When he is in position, the door then opens to reveal a tired looking John behind it.
He can go home to his soul mate.

Unbeknownst to John 3,509 miles away, a twenty-three year old recovering addict lay held up in a hospital bed clutching his left shoulder and crying out from an unknown searing pain. The red thread would briefly make an appearance but would be blamed upon a drug induced haze. Its light quickly extinguishes and when later questioned about his outburst, he would claim someone had shot him.
"...John?"
Sherlock then gets down on one knee and produces a small black box out of his suit pocket. “So, would you give me the honor of becoming my husband?
Warnings: Johnlock slash (Rating could go up), beta'd now, I'm not British,
Sherlock Holmes!?" Sherlock's breathing hitched at that last part and he quickly turns away from the confused army doctor. John rises to his feet as well and reaches forward, "No! That isn't it at all! Sherlock, I-." Before John can even touch him, Sherlock has moved and is quickly walking to his room. A hand comes up and wipes across an angular face and John realizes that Sherlock is crying. A door is slammed and John is left alone.
Sherlock can’t help the smile that spreads across his face as he rolls his eyes, and after a moment, nods his head. John retrieves his mobile out of his pocket, and with a brilliant smiled aimed at his detective, he dials Greg’s number. As the conversation ends, the blogger and detective go to get ready for the evening ahead.

The other man in his arms hugs him back just as tightly for a few minutes until suddenly, his arms go slack and he becomes a dead weight in John’s arms. He withdraws in alarm as the other man begins convulsing violently. He lays Sherlock on the floor in the recovery position as Sherlock begins screaming, tears streaming down his agonized face.
There's a sound just outside of his bedroom.
He blinks his eyes clear, and swallows past his misery,
As Sherlock lay, gasping for breath, recovering from his orgasm, John turns all his attention to his own erection. The sight of Sherlock's flushed face, gasping chest, and relaxed frame, bring John over the edge and he soon comes with a gasp of the detective's name.
Sherlock silently berates himself for not realizing John had not actually

John’s butterflies instantly turn to lead at the thought. Panic briefly overtakes him until logic informs him that Sherlock wouldn’t have said anything at all, if that were the case. So…that can’t be it. John tries to desperately read Sherlock like the detective so easily reads John without prevail. With a sigh of frustration, John’s voice is deceitfully calm as he inquires, “So, what’s the problem?” After what feels like an eternity, Sherlock quietly states, “I invited Mary along. We are all expected to be there at half three tonight.”
as their mate?"
There's been a few murders.
The hallways are empty save for a few dead bodies that are littered sporadically throughout the establishment. He hears more gunfire just ahead through two ominous doorways that lead to the main pool area. As he begins walking softly and quietly, suddenly, the shots die down and everything is eerily silent. He begins walking faster, checking each room briefly but efficiently as he finally makes it to the end of the hallway. He opens the doors and slips inside.
He’s finally had enough. With Rosie downstairs with Mrs. Hudson, and Sherlock’s supposedly in his mind palace while John pretends to read the paper, John risks a glance at the other man. He does not expect to see a pair of sad, verdigris eyes trained on his own before quickly slamming shut. Maybe Sherlock believes that if he is quick enough, John won’t notice the sadness still lurking around his features. But John sees and no one knows Sherlock Holmes better than John Watson.
. Whomever had said that was definitely correct. The hot Afghan sun blisters his skin. The cold reality that you could die any minute hangs like a dark, threatening shroud over the troop’s heads.  The bullets whirling past his head, the smoke from detonated explosives, and the adrenaline rush that comes from saving another person all add up together to make him feel alive. He has never felt so alive. He thrives under stressful situations, and he finally feels like he is making a difference. That is, at age 28, until he gets shot.

As Sherlock had expected, John explodes, “Sherlock, why the hell did you do that? What on Earth were you thinking? What possible inclination did I give that made you think that I would ever want to see her again?!” Sherlock curses his transport as he unsubtly flinches at John’s tone, but he completely ignores what John said as he replies, “While your anger is understandable, it is completely unnecessary.”
John doesn’t want to lie to the other man and because of that, for the first time, he is completely honest when he replies with, “I chose her once, yes. You were gone. You left me alone again—which we are still going to talk about at some point—but this time, I couldn’t hail a cab or scale a wall to reach you. I wanted to join you most days, though. I almost followed you several times, in fact. I sat in my room with my gun in my mouth thinking of how easy it would have been to pull the trigger.”
Thousands of thoughts raced through the blond man’s head as he drew closer to the hospital. ‘God, I hope he’s alright,’ seemed to be playing on a constant loop in the blogger’s mind. John sat rigidly on the edge of his seat watching as the hospital grew closer and closer as he anxiously waited to leave the confining vehicle. When the cab finally pulled up to St. Mary’s hospital, John threw the money at the cabdriver and raced inside the building. From there, he asked the nurses were Sherlock was located and he was then directed to a waiting room. It was there that he came face to face with Mycroft Holmes.
"How did you...never mind.. I don't want to know" Sherlock only laughs softly and replies, "Obvious. It's on the left side of the bed which would correspond with your dominate hand. You wouldn't want it out in the open where anyone could see it, but, would want it close by. Therefore, in the nightstand."
John's anger had steadily climbed as each word was articulated by the cruel pair against the consulting detective, but when he looks over to Sherlock his heart stops and then breaks for his beautiful genius.
Notes: It gets better I promise! They're... just going through a hard time. I have good plans for this story and it doesn't end here. :D I hope I have done The Fall some justice. I'm sorry this is so late! My life has been hectic lately! I'm in a play currently and have tons of lines to memorize, I have a HUGE test coming up (the kind that determines your future big), and I've been out of town *sweatdrop*. I'll try to have eight up by tomorrow! I'm pretty much finished, I just got to run it by my extraordinary Beta! Next chapter: The threads are finally explained! (sorta...kinda)
His eyes well with tears and the once strong, proud army doctor wavers slightly before dropping to his knees beside his best friend. Before he has a chance to react fully, a few people take him by the shoulders and pull him away. " No, he's my friend. He's my friend.
"I will always love you. I was just angry with you and you appeared not to care.
UGH. I need to stop now, or I'll just rant about this until the character limit. Anyway, I hope you enjoy this chapter. Happy reading!
He thinks to himself. He picks up the knife and looks at his reflection in its glistening surface. He looks down at himself with self loathing and begins to think back to all the times they had had together. He bitterly laughs when he realizes that he was the one to ruin it all. His grip tightens further on the knife and his eyes harden and his body runs cold.
Sherlock stares as John exudes obvious anger and frustration. The detective desperately wants to correct the other man, but he holds his tongue, curls up in the familiar leather of the couch, and he grips his curls tightly as he quickly lowers his head against his knees to prevent John from reading his expression. He swallows thickly before he inquires as impassively as possible, “What exactly do you want from me, John?”
Your eyes are so cold and your words bite,
He was prepared to delete the entire experience but when he ventured into his Mind Palace to the door that was marked, “
When John was conscious, he was extremely delirious or in excruciating pain. Unbeknownst to the now ex-army doctor, it would take nearly a year to gain stability enough to be flown back to London. As his 36th birthday neared, Clara visited him in the hospital in tears. “J-John, we didn’t hear w-word, and…and Harry she….” Clara sobs.
His voice wavers dangerously as he continues with, “When I returned back from Afghanistan, Clara, visited me and told me that Harry had killed herself.” He wipes at his face, trying to stive back tears, “Overdosed on Joy, which is why I reacted so negatively when I found out you did drugs..I just kept thinking of how I never got the opportunity to say goodbye to Harry. I couldn’t save either of you.”
Verdigris eyes snap upward as those words were spoken. “We didn’t exactly talk about how either of us felt after you fell. We both left too much unspoken. I left my feelings buried inside and you weren’t exactly forthcoming with your own.  Sherlock, I know my actions have been telling you that’s all over….but, I don’t want to love somebody else.” The detective has a small smile painted across his face as he says, “I don’t want to love anyone else either.” John’s answering grin lights up his entire face. “Good.. That’s good. So, where do you want this to go? What do you want out of this?”
As soon as the door opened, John heard a bellowing "BORED!" from the single occupant in the room. Usually that was met with an eyeroll or an amused chuckle. Instead, John broke out into a relieved smile and approached the bed in hurried strides. Once at the bedside, John giggled when he took in the disheveled appearance of the annoyed detective. Sherlock wore a blue hospital gown that looked like it had swallowed him whole. "I know love. There isn't much I can do though. You have to stay tonight under observation." At John's words, Sherlock let out a humorless snort.
It was at that point that John hears a scream, and, as much as he doesn’t want to leave Sherlock alone, Mary is still in danger, and he must help her too. He makes sure Sherlock won’t fall out of his chair, and then makes his way through the decaying building toward the sound.
Suddenly, John hears a snort of laughter as Sherlock howls his amusement at John’s apparent despair, twin tear tracks stream down the Consulting Detective’s cheeks in his mirth. John steps forward and it is only then that he notices that the clock has stopped counting down and is, in fact, stuck between 1:28 and 1:29. Sherlock continues to cackle in shamefully present glee as John rants and raves about the detective’s awful prank.
“Yes,” John cuts in before Mycroft can say anything. The auburn haired man glares at the army doctor as he passes him, but John ignores the other man in favor of following the nurse as she leads them to Sherlock.
When they reached home, John broke out into tears. His mother and father quickly enveloped him in a tight embrace and asked him what was wrong. “I’ll never find him!” John whimpered, “I’ll never get to meet him, or love him, or see him! I’ll be alone forever!” At that moment, John sobs even harder.
tackled the masked man to the ground. But unbeknownst to the armature detective, the man had knife and had managed to stab his lower abdomen. Greg, before the man could escape, had handcuffed him and zip tied his feet together. He then rushes to Sherlock's side, takes the Sherlock's blue scarf to stunt the bleeding, and then calls for an ambulance and other Yarders
"Don't be absurd, John." Came the monotonous response. " In my profession, I know when people are lying and you are a terrible liar. Either you are lying to me, or you are withholding some of the facts." Sherlock then turns to look at John. His carefully sculpted face, in John's opinion, had never been this withdrawn or dispassionate.
Sherlock wasn’t ignoring John. No, he absolutely was
Their attacker, once rendered immobile, lay bloodied and broken on the dirty, cold street. John approached Sherlock with a speed that only training would allow and quickly assessed his wounds. "Sherlock! Sherlock can you hear me!?" John frantically yelled, "You're going to be alright. Just sit tight love. I'll take care of you." Carefully, so he doesn't move Sherlock too much, John reaches into his pocket and retrieves his mobile and dials 999. He removes his woolen jumper and firmly places against the gash.
In this world, everyone has someone. Some are fortunate to find their other half in their lifetime. Others are not. There are some poor, unfortunate souls that never become complete. They will never know what it is like to be loved wholly or cherished for their odd quirks and unique personalities.
As John once again reaches out to comfort the detective, he briefly makes contact with Sherlock's signature Belstaff coat until the ebony haired man wrenches himself out of John's grasp, and the detective's long legs propel him out the bedroom door and down the stairs at a pace faster than John can keep up with. The guilt he is now feeling nearly sends him toppling to the floor, but he catches his footing at the last moment. John races to the opened window and watches as Sherlock disappears around the corner and out of sight.
The detective places a gentle kiss against the doctors lips before withdrawing long enough to nod his head in affirmation. The doctor brings his hands up slowly to the detective's waistband and inches them downwards so that his member stands proud. He then allows Sherlock to do the same to him.
This, of course, only enrages John further and his voice mounts in rising volume, “Unnecessary?! Sherlock—. How could you even—
So why does it tear you apart?
’ reverberates against John’s cranium as he finally notices the crystal-clear signs of distress. In fact, Sherlock hasn’t been able to hide what he’s feeling since he came back home. To think he once thought this was a game. John finally looks past what Sherlock is saying to what he actually
Mummy Homes rose with an air of elegance as she greeted the newly weds with a warm smile: “Sherlock and John Watson-Holmes. Congratulations!” The answering smile on both men’s faces were genuine. The classy woman kisses her son on the cheek and moves to envelope John in a warm hug to whisper in his ear, “I’m so happy for you both. He has loved you for a long time, John. I’m so pleased to see it reciprocated.” John’s choked out reply conveys sincerity as he says, “Thank you Mrs. Holmes. I do love him too.”
His mother's tears and burdensome and they cause their own torture.
"Bored." John's answering chuckle makes Sherlock smile. He can hear the army doctor bumping about in the kitchen. When he has collected his tea mug, John walks over to the couch, leans forward, and presses a lingering kiss against soft cupid bowed lips. A hum of approval escapes both individuals. When the two separate, Sherlock's eyes flutter open and he sits up to allow John to snuggle into his side. When both doctor and detective have settled, John turns on the telly.
