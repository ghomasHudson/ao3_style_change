“I’m not quite a dog therapist,” Stark laughs, “I tend to avoid human emotions too. But get her used to seeing strangers? Take her out with you on small dates – maybe walks in the park together with your date before you bring them home?”
Asia is somewhere he’s never visited, and it’s a clean slate without any memory of war. It’ll be good: he can excuse it to Fury by saying he’s building diplomatic ties, and JARVIS, helpful as ever, puts together for him an itinerary hopping from the coasts of Sulawesi to the stupas of Bagan.
He glances at the sketch he had made of the Avengers Tower, way back in that cafe when it was still being built as Stark Tower and he didn't know yet how it represented everything beautiful in New York.
that all these letters would simply never reach him when his address was the most recognisable in New York.
He doesn’t stay on the common floor longer after that, doing his best to avoid Tony and Natasha for the next few weeks because it isn’t fair to any of them that Steve can’t keep his foolish heart under control.
“Just worried for Libby,” Steve sits on the bed. Liberty curls around his feet, the stitches a long line across her chest. She’s a strong girl, stronger than Steve. “I need to know, though: did Sam introduce me to Tony to set us up?”
He thinks of baking with Jarvis, and gardening with Ana. Of taking apart the washing machine and putting it back together again before anyone comes home. He guesses Steve doesn’t do any that. “What’s it – what’s it like? At your house?”
Smirking, Natasha replies easily, “it’s the aesthetics of the pictures. Can’t wear heels if my fiancé is tiny.”
“You’re, uh, JARVIS said you’re leaving,” Tony starts hesitantly, leaning on the doorframe. “You alright, Cap?”
Things aren't really helped by Stark, either: despite the dark bags under his eyes, Stark's ruffled hair and crumpled coat strips away the brisk air of self-assurance that usually surrounds the Doctor, leaving behind a softness that Steve doesn't dare look closely into. He's wearing his red scrubs too, which now Steve realises actually highlights Stark's eyes well, especially in the bar's dim lights.
Tony would very much like to come up with a witty quip, about proper kissing techniques and how to charm a guy, but Steve’s hand continues to run through Tony’s hair, gentle motions that pull him down, down beneath the tide of sleep that’s full of fog and dark and clouds.
“Artificial intelligence,” Howard answers. “They’ll change the weapons industry forever. Keep our country safer than you did.”
Tony watches as Sarah all but pushes Steve into the room, closing the door again with a click that sounds too much like a death sentence. He hears her greet Rhodey loudly - what had Steve said to convince Rhodey to let him talk with Tony alone?
It's then, with Tony half-blinded by the lights, when a shout comes, shrill and panicked. "Ticking! The thing's ticking!"
But he's a doctor. He knows that wouldn't make things better. Instead, he lets his hand move slightly to the right, curling over the bumps of Steve's scarred knuckles.
Slowly, almost reverently, Tony takes one, and then both hands, fingers splaying out over Steve's palm as his eyes dart all over Steve's face searching for a lie.
The drumming of Tony’s fingers on the table stops, leaving a strangely empty silence. His smile turns less wide. “Dinner, huh?”
The tug of amused warmth is like coming home, like they're fifteen again with no worries and a world of possibility. "Just a hunch."
. He shouldn’t have let himself blurt it out like that, his self-control lost in the pleasant buzz after Steve’s far too-chaste kiss. “One day,” Tony repeats. “Hopefully. If you want.”
Humming quietly, he carries him to their bedroom, sidestepping the socks on the floor. Lowering Tony on bed is always a careful act. He hadn’t bothered to tidy their bed when he had woken up from his restless sleep earlier, so he slowly lowers Tony on top of the rumpled sheets.
“Sir, I believe you’ve surpassed Captain Rogers’ limit of twelve consecutive hours in the workshop. U will be ready to serve you again after you have taken at least an hour of rest.”
It's either very brave or very foolish to go against Captain Carol Danvers, and Tony settles on the latter when Rogers shakes his head. “Not everyone has an 8-hour shift job, Danvers. Some of us have to do actual heavy lifting.”
Steve thinks of Doctor Stark’s sharp smile and barbed teasing. He’s met a fair share of doctors on the job, but having grown familiar with Doctor Foster’s easy professionalism, Stark’s swift quips were... different.
’ and calls Natasha as soon as he gets home. Liberty – more energised now that she’s home – follows Steve upstairs to the bedroom. Throwing open his closet, he paces in front of it until Nat answers, smiling a little when Sam replies with confirmation that the asshole Hodge won’t be frequenting any dog parks soon.
Patting Steve's shoulder, she places a hand on the door handle to keep it closed. "In any case, I've assigned Agent Wilson to the new Falcon project. He'll be our eyes in the skies for weapons movements in the desert."
. He closes his eyes, cheeks grower even warmer with embarrassment. Has he always been this rusty at talking with new people?
Liberty barks, moving to yap at Miss Potts. Steve quickly clicks his tongue, motioning for Liberty to sit. Sullenly, with a heavy thump of her tail on the floor, she quiets down. Steve scratches the back of her ear consolingly.
Tony feels his chest tighten. “Hey, Sourpatch. I’m gonna need you to do a hell lot of things for me, but it’ll be the last time so consider it – ”
The mansion’s halls are unfriendly to new visitors, and Steve only manages not to get lost thanks to his improved senses. Following the scent of freshly-baked pie, he escapes Howard Stark to find the kitchen, where he hopes Jarvis might give a clue on how to find Tony, and how to make amends.
Tony isn't going to do any of the last words kind of shit, no matter how much he wants to kiss that frown away. That wouldn't be kind or fair to Steve, not when Steve has a whole life left to fall in love with someone else.
Pepper had dropped by earlier, and Natasha’s been making periodic visits every few hours to swat the back of Tony’s head, muttering what Tony hopes are fond, affectionate phrases in Russian –
He might never get to hear Steve say his name again, that gentle dip between the syllables, as if Steve cared enough to say them right. It’s stupid, utterly
But he has entry into the Stark Household, and proof that whatever other crime it was that Tony had accused him of, Steve hadn't gone back on
, give me more credit than that. You visit orphanages just to stop the babies from crying.  Nobody who knows you would say you're capable of doing that much harm willingly. The only person you're likely to hurt is yourself."
"You want me to keep to making weapons," his hand curls into a fist. "You want me to stay out of it, but you want me to keep making weapons for SHIELD."
“Mrs. Carter is hardly a damsel,” Steve warily takes the seat across him, where Kamala's glass of lime soda still waits. In front of it is a new basket of potato wedges.
Suspicion drips from Steve's voice, and it's funny how one word from Steve is enough to reach into the heart of the matter, into the heart beating hard in Tony's chest.
Because he can already picture the weapons that will be used against Steve - and he feels sick to the core at the thought of Steve's thin arms holding up something larger than him, designed to injure, to kill.
"Enemy of my enemy is a friend?" Tony suggests. "Or at least, Howard'll listen to the golden soldier. I'm twenty five, and all I've ever done is blow things up."
Clearly, Obie doesn't enjoy his answer, and he lights up a cigar right there, the smoke puffing in Tony's face. “Let me make this very clear: you make weapons, or you give up Steve Rogers. There was a reason why Howard chose Maria. And it wasn’t because Maria was pretty.”
“For what it’s worth,” her fondness is clear in her words, “Tony’s an old friend. He’s almost as hopeless as you but he deserves someone good. We didn’t plan on you bumping into you this often – we wanted to invite him over for Christmas dinner.”
He scurries out of the kitchen before Tony can call him back, and he doesn’t bother using the elevators. Taking the steps two at a time, Steve resolutely tells his heart to quit doing summersaults around Tony.
Natasha's right. He needs to find a life outside the job. His apartment is depressingly bare, though, and Steve can do more good here.
"And he drinks less than people believe," Pepper pulls out the chair next to Steve, sitting down. When put together, she had spent more time with Tony than Steve ever did. She knows well enough that Tony never drinks anything but coffee in the workshop. "Tony talked about you, Captain. He wouldn't want you to run yourself ragged like this."
"Stark Industries has a new factory there," Tony flicks the bolt into the growing pile inside the next box. "It was the last one Howard made."
And when Tony's foot keeps creeping up Steve's legs, dangerously close to his thighs, Steve stands up, clearing his throat.
Yes, Tony did know about Joseph Rogers, and it was why despite public appearances of seeming drunk, he had stopped himself from actually drinking in private. His heart felt hollow, but there was enough space to hear Steve's fears.
Fury is sending another firetruck their way. Handing the hose over to Thor, Steve hops off the ladder, jogging to Carol.
His friends mean well by setting him up with a rotation of people. Hell, Steve had even asked for it when he realised how much he missed meeting new people. With their own busy lives – Bucky’s bookshop, Natasha’s gym and Sam’s work at the VA – he can’t expect his friends to keep him company every day. But meeting new people doesn’t seem to be working because none of the dates so far seemed interested in coming back a second time.
Steve knows. It's etched in him, all the small things about Tony: his favorite flower, the piano lullabies Tony loved most, the constellations he wanted to visit, and the way Tony snored in his sleep. If Tony is gone - if they really never find Tony - Steve doesn't know what to do with himself, with the universe of tiny memories stitched together to make the bright ball of want, of regret, of
“My knight in shining shield,” Tony prods at the scrape marks on the shield, grinning up at Steve. “Marry me?”
. They had probably doubted whether Steve could survive a mission without collapsing or losing a limb, but he’s proven that he can pull his own weight, and the editors have been more than happy with the visuals he’s provided for new issues over the past few months.
“The longest. Honestly, this whole week’s been a nightmare - the specs I sent over to R&D need to be completely redone, Fury keeps chasing me on new updates for the helicarrier… we’ve been out on three calls this week and it’s only Thursday. I feel like this is the longest we’ve had some time to ourselves for days.”
Tony’s first crush had been on Captain America, not Steve Rogers. He had liked the hero he saw in the posters and comic book and secondhand stories, not Steve. Even if any of that admiration had been for Steve, it was only a boyhood fancy, one that must have faded years ago. It certainly doesn’t say anything about Tony’s feelings for Steve now.
“I love you and you won’t lose me.” Steve knows it’s not something Tony can guarantee, not with the lives they lead, but he kisses Tony back and believes him anyway.
Steve gives a start as a sudden and loud CRACK fills the silence in the lab. He looks down to find that the edge of Tony’s table that he'd been holding on to has broken off in his hands. Steve blushes, a wave of intense mortification spreading through him. What the hell is wrong with him today?
When he enters the living room, he’s greeted with an exuberant embrace from Thor, who nearly lifts him off his feet. “Captain, I am heartily glad for your return. Hulk and I are about to begin a glorious sparring match in the gym. Would you like to join us? We would appreciate your company.”
that first comes to mind, eyes fixed on Steve’s. He knows when Steve is teasing, and this doesn’t seem like a joke to him.
Letting out a quiet sigh, Steve takes a long sip from his drink. The game has now moved on to Carol, who is being challenged by Rhodey to a dare of some sort. He also can’t help noticing Tony purposely avoiding his gaze, which stings more than Steve would like to admit.
Foggy laughs and moves to sit, placing his large shoulder bag on the back of his chair. Steve returns to his seat. “Mostly,” Foggy acknowledges, and Steve ducks his head to hide a grin.
Jan smiles and slips her hand in his. “Got it. I’ll talk to Foggy and see when he’s free for a chat, then.”
He had brushed it off as a joke at first, simply his subconscious’ way of dealing with the not-sizeable-at-all crush he’d started nursing on Steve for a while now. Maybe for longer than a while, maybe ever since he’d woken up from the darkness of space to the sight of Steve’s bright blue eyes and the quiet happiness on his face when he saw that Tony was alright. But that was all it was, just a crush. Nothing more, and certainly nothing Tony couldn’t deal with discretely before it grew into something with strings, with feelings.
A loud crash behind them makes Clint wince, and he shoves the half-empty mug back into Tony’s hands. “I think that’s my cue.” As Clint races from the room, Tony stares after him before shrugging and returning his attention to his coffee.
Steve scuffs his shoe against the sidewalk, kicking up the little pebbles in frustration. “Yeah, except now I have no idea where he is!” He freezes, replaying what she just said. “Wait, you really think so?”
has never been a problem for Steve. But there’s something about Tony in his quieter moments, when he’s standing still just long enough for Steve to try and read him, something that Steve can’t quite decipher.
“What kind of nickname is Foggy, anyway?” Bucky says, leaning precariously back in his chair to catch his pencil.
Something between a chuckle and a sigh makes its way out of Steve’s throat as he forces himself to relax, letting his forehead fall forward to rest on Tony’s chest. Tony lifts one hand to stroke Steve’s hair, and it feels wonderful. Tony’s arms are looped around his neck, holding him in place. It feels like a weight has been lifted off his chest, like Steve can breathe again.
“You’ve done nothing wrong, Tony,” Steve says heavily, shaking his head. “I’m so sorry, I never meant to—” He lets out a broken half-laugh before continuing. “It’s not what you think, Tony. You never made me uncomfortable, it was never that.” Gathering up all the remnants of his courage, Steve looks up to meet Tony’s questioning gaze.
“Sure,” Steve says with a smile. “I’m happy to meet up with him.” He’s happy to do Jan a favor. The worst thing that could happen is him not getting along with Foggy and having to endure an awkward chat, which doesn’t seem so bad on the scale of things.
“And yet,” Death muses, “you did lose him.” Wisps of air trail off her fingers before disappearing into nothing. Steve blinks hard to keep her in his sights as her shape starts to blur.
Later, Rhodey corners Tony as they’re dishing out the popcorn for movie night. “Man, I don’t know what the hell is going on with you and Rogers, but he’s got you hook, line, and sinker. You’re a goner, Tones.”
Steve winces as Nat grabs the remote next to him to turn the volume up. It seems like he can’t spend five minutes outside of his room these days without hearing about another member of the press speculating over Clint and Tony’s relationship.
“Well, you remember all those fantasies you had when I suggested that I could model for you?” Tony asks, leaning back with a long, exaggerated stretch.
“It’s almost five. We could go get some pizza in an hour?” Jan suggests. She’s sitting cross legged on Steve’s bed, squinting with concentration at the sketchbook in front of her, surrounded by a wide array of fancy highlighters.
“But it’s good,” Foggy says, and the joy in his voice is so clear that Steve’s heart clenches in his chest for a moment. “It’s better than I ever imagined, and I’d spent so long thinking about it. Because it’s not perfect, but it’s real.”
“It would have to be a very good distraction,” Steve responds, working to keep a straight face even as Tony leans in, clearly trying to wrangle a kiss from Steve.
Steve runs a hand down Tony’s arm and leans back to enjoy the view of Tony wearing his jacket with his name on it. He’ll admit, it never fails to bring a smile to his face.
“And here I thought I was being more than obvious,” Tony says, his voice turning shy. “Does this mean… Steve, do you…”
“It’s not for me either. They’ve worked for a few friends of mine but I never really understood it. The idea of going on a date with a stranger just somehow doesn’t make sense to me. I mean, how could you have feelings for someone you don’t even know?” Steve pauses, flushing when he realizes that in his agitation, he’s raised his voice without noticing.
“No, you’re not. And don’t think I don’t know what you’re doing with the pet names, Rogers. It’s not going to work.”
“You’re mine too,” Steve replies. His eyes are locked on Tony’s. Somehow, Tony thinks Steve is talking about more than Tony being his favorite Avenger. There’s a swooping feeling in his stomach at the thought, like Tony’s standing on the edge of a cliff, unsure of whether to jump or stand back, but it also leaves him feeling warm.
Tony stifles a groan as he lies back on the couch and flings his arms over his face. He knows Steve means it, that this has been much more than a game for far longer than he wants to admit, for both Steve and himself.
Steve dips his head down before meeting Tony’s eyes again. He looks more than a little unsure, and Tony feels a sharp pang of
He knows they’re innocent, that Clint and Tony are just friends, but the idea of all these people believing that Clint and Tony are together makes his hackles rise.
Steve knows he’s crossing a line even as the words pass his lips, but he’s feeling so much at the moment, it’s impossible to stop. Even before Steve realized the extent of his feelings for Tony, the idea of losing him had been unthinkable. The thought that he could have so easily lost Tony to the multiverse today had it not been for Thor, has left Steve reeling.
“That was me making a strategic decision to save your life, Cap,” Tony responds, placing his wrench down before turning to Steve. Despite the even tone of voice, Tony’s eyes are flashing with emotion. Steve reads the hidden anger in Tony’s mask of calm, and it only serves to infuriate him further.
But all he cares about now is the delight blooming across Steve’s face at Tony’s answer, and the answering giddiness he feels sweeping through him.
All the time in the world and a dictionary with every word in every language wouldn’t make this an easier question to answer.
“Steve. Sweetheart.” Steve’s heart skips a beat at the sound of the endearment coming from Tony’s lips. An endearment meant for
Steve sighs in relief when Tony manages to catch Clint in time, only to freeze again when the reporters gathered beside the debris start yelling with excitement and pointing their cameras up at Tony and Clint.
,” Tony allows, letting his eyes linger on Steve’s face. He tries his best to avoid looking at the beanie, but it’s a lost cause. “Whatever floats your boat, Cap.”
Steve blinks, feeling a little like he’s been hit over the head with something heavy. Around him, Steve hears a chorus of “awww”s and “how cute”s from everyone else, and what he thinks is a sound of agreement from Scott. He blinks again, Tony’s quiet, mumbled confession echoing in his head.
Steve huffs, lifting Tony’s free hand to his lips for a kiss. “You had good reason to be, but you know that’s not what I meant.”
“I know it’s not easy to talk about this, and it means a lot that you’re comfortable opening up to me about it.”
He could have sworn his football jacket had been right there this morning, freshly pressed and wrinkle-free…
Steve’s halfway out the door when he notices the empty coat hanger on the side of his bed. He picks it up, frowning slightly.
“That’s fine, he’s just looking for a little reassurance. Foggy’s great, he’s so creative with his designs and he’s really open and easy to talk to. I’ve always thought you guys would hit it off, actually! You could take this as a chance to get to know him.”
Steve shoves the baseball cap over his face. He usually doesn’t get coffee outside the Tower on weekends, but the thought of running into Tony or Clint in the kitchen had sent him down the street to this new coffee place.
“Never mind,” Tony finishes, looking down at his feet. He shoves his hands in his pockets, and Steve bites back the completely inappropriate urge to smooth out Tony’s frown with his fingers, or his lips.
Steve looks up at the sound of a knock on his door, a sinking feeling in his gut. He can make a fair guess who his visitor might be, and he’s not ready to put on a brave face in front of Tony yet.
Steve turns and cuts him off with a short, bruising kiss that leaves them both panting for air when they break apart.
“Wait, hold on, let me finish. I’ve been practicing this way too many times with DUM-E and JARVIS. They’ll be disappointed if I don’t get it perfect.”
“Tony,” Steve says gently, “I’m not with Foggy. Jan set us up as friends, it was never anything else.”
Steve knows immediately from the note of false cheer in Tony’s voice that something’s wrong. “I was just telling the lovely Miss Carlota here that although I am heartbroken to leave her presence, we unfortunately have urgent business that requires our attention and must bid her farewell.”
It’s only later that Steve realizes Tony wore his jacket for the entire party, and the thought has him smiling all the way back to his dorm room.
“Hmm, you wound me.” Tony takes off his shoes quickly and shifts up to the head of the bed, grabbing a pillow. “Gimme some room, Jan.”
“I’ll give you twenty bucks if you turn that down, JARVIS,” Rhodey remarks, darting a quick glance at the ceiling from the other end of the room. He’s busy with his own upgrades to the War Machine armor and a possible new jet design. There’s something comforting in working side by side with his best friend again that Tony cherishes.
Steve winces a little, remembering how awkward he’d been. The bright satisfaction on Tony’s face at getting him to dance had been worth it though, and Jan wasn’t wrong - it had been fun.
Usually Tony can also tie a perfect Windsor knot without batting an eye, courtesy of Jarvis' strict guidance, but Steve refrains from mentioning this out of tact.
Tony may have been reading more than a few romance novels in the past two weeks in an effort to redirect his romantic and sexual frustrations towards something other than an increasingly irresistible Steve Rogers, but the gist of it is pretty much there.
It had started last New Year’s Eve when Tony had gotten drunk on Thor’s mead and woken up in the workshop to a list of resolutions he hadn’t remembered making. They had ranged from ‘convince Clint to dye his hair purple for a week’ to ‘set honeybear up on a blind date with Carol’, and most of them had been completely ridiculous. One caught his attention though:
He had been so distracted by his own feelings for Tony, he’d failed to realize how much he’d hurt Tony by pulling away from him. Now Steve’s ruined everything, and Tony doesn’t even know the truth yet.
Two weeks later, Tony walks into the living room to find Steve playing Mario Kart with Clint while wearing a rainbow-colored beanie. He very nearly spills his coffee over his newly-pressed suit and flees the room before Steve or anyone else can comment on the flush spreading over his face. Tony Stark does not blush, thank you very much.
It’s just anxiety, that’s all; he wants the mission to go smoothly, and undercover operations have always left him antsy, even when he isn’t the one going undercover.
“Do you like them?” Tony asks, breaking the silence as Steve looks down at his present. He clears his throat. “I thought about getting you a new pair. Something fancier, maybe, if you’d like that—”
Steve takes the box and carefully lifts its lid, releasing a breath as he sees what’s inside. “Are those my…”
Before Steve can investigate the matter further, Tony continues. “I get that you were scared, Steve. The truth is, I was too.” Tony brushes a hand over his mouth before letting out a half-laugh.
Tony only releases Steve’s arm once they’re around the corner. His hand brushes against Steve’s bare wrist for one brief moment. It’s nothing, a mere accident, but Steve feels the touch like a brand on his skin all the way back to the office.
Tony’s breath catches audibly in his throat. He wants to take those glasses that look absurdly perfect on Steve’s face and toss them aside. He wants to lean down and kiss the tiny marks left on Steve’s nose by those too-wide frames, even though he knows the serum will remove them in a matter of seconds.
Tony’s self-aware enough to realize that if it weren’t for Rhodey as their audience, he would have climbed Steve like a tree by now, challenge be damned.
“I’m majoring in pre-law, but I helped with costuming at a theatre summer camp for a few years in high school and I really liked it, so I wanted to give this a go.” He grimaces. “The acting, however, was not for me.”
“That’s it, Rogers. I let you sulk yesterday but I know you were lying when you said you weren’t feeling well. You’ve been acting weird for days and no one knows why. Not even Nat—”
“I don’t know, Sharon,” Tony says, raising one hand to tug at his shirt collar. The room is packed, and it’s starting to feel a little warm. Her face is gentle with understanding when he looks up to meet her eyes, her hand on his arm, and the nervousness in Tony’s chest settles a little.
Tony’s eyes land on the bedside table and Steve follows his gaze to the picture Tony had given him, the picture of Tony as a kid playing with the shield he'd made. “You always have,” he finishes, leaning down to press his forehead against Steve.
Steve rubs a hand over his eyes. Right now, he would like nothing more than to crawl into bed, pull the covers over his head, and forget about everything he just read. “Not today, Thor. But thanks for the offer.”
Steve glances up at Tony from beneath his long, golden eyelashes, his pretty blue eyes framed by those
He steps back and brushes a hand over his mouth as he gives Steve a once-over. A muffled sound of laughter escapes his lips before he clamps them shut. Rhodey grins. “Is that an Iron Man hoodie, Rogers?”
“Unfortunately, Colonel, I am unable to take such a bribe. However, I do appreciate the offer,” Jarvis intones drily.
“You weren’t so bad yourself, Rogers,” Tony counters. His hand is back in Steve’s hair now, his fingers applying welcome and gratifying pressure to Steve’s scalp as he keeps his eyes on Steve’s face, a bright smile in his gaze. “You came back and we dealt with the ugly red bastard together, like always.”
Jan’s hug throws him off balance and Steve rocks to the side a little with a laugh before hugging her back fiercely. “You’re amazing, and don’t let anybody tell you otherwise, you hear me?” she says. Steve smiles into her shoulder.
Death bends down and retrieves his shield, her fingernails pressing moon crescents into the metal. “First, take this.”
Tony has no doubt that Steve’s been waiting all morning for him to emerge from his workshop, just to see how Tony would react to this new (and terrible) development in Steve’s sense of style.
“Yeah, if you want. I really like you. I’ve had a crush on you for months, and I think you like me too, so—”
Then, before Steve can say another word, Tony is gone, only leaving behind the heavy clang of the door slamming shut behind him.
“If you think, Steve Rogers, that I do not know the value of Tony Stark’s life, then you are a fool.” Steve’s breath leaves him in a loud, wet gasp at the sound of that name. It’s been so long since he’s heard it from anyone else.
“I missed you,” Steve tells him, and it’s not what he meant to say, but it comes out anyway. Because he had. It had been fascinating at first, getting to meet and interact with a younger version of Tony, but the fascination had quickly turned into horror when they had realized what each blast of the Time Stone meant.
“Only because your Prince Charming sprinted over and pulled you away from the glass at the last second.” Nat lets out an honest-to-god
Still, he wants to do it right. Tony pushes his fingers into Steve’s hair, reveling in the way Steve arches into his touch automatically. He loosens his hand from Steve’s shirt and holds on to Steve’s glasses carefully.
Death’s words stretch out in front of Steve, a barren, lonely wasteland. They bury themselves under his skin, threatening to bring him to his knees once again.
“I’m sorry if I made you uncomfortable and god, Steve, just tell me how I can fix this. I don’t want to lose you.” Tony’s voice has now taken on a pleading note, and Steve aches at the sound.
Steve watches with a wistful smile as Foggy and Matt walk off in the opposite direction. They’re leaning into each other’s space like they’ve always belonged there, and Steve wants Tony there with him so much it leaves him breathless.
The smile that breaks out on Tony’s face is so beautiful that, for a moment, Steve finds it hard to breathe.
“Good.” Tony’s smile turns soft, and Steve feels the weight of the love in his eyes like a protective shield, keeping them both safe.
“It’s possible I was lashing out because of other reasons too,” Tony admits, ducking his head a little nervously. If Steve didn’t know any better, he’d say Tony was blushing.
Steve’s heart feels lighter than air. He thinks if someone challenged him to fly right now, he just might be able to do it. He’s not sure he’s ever been this happy, except for maybe when Tony had smiled shyly across the table from him on their first date, and he wondered if this was the start of the rest of his life.
“No, it’s fine, Steve, don’t worry. I know exactly what you mean. I didn’t really get how romance and dating worked for the longest time, and I still don’t, really.”
He appreciates the invitation, but parties have always been either a source of boredom or embarrassment for him, and he doesn’t think the party being thrown for
Something in Steve’s chest breaks wide open at the quiet despair in Tony’s voice, and he presses a hand to his heart. He looks up at Tony. Suddenly it hits him, as clear as daylight, exactly what he’s been missing all along.
“Not at the cost of your own life, Tony!” Steve shouts, now holding on to the countertop in an effort to hold himself back. “And what the hell do you mean, ‘why would I care?’ You’re one of my best friends, Tony! Do you think I would just sit back and watch you sacrifice yourself without a second thought?”
He reaches for his shield as a Doombot tries to tackle him from his left, destroying it easily with one throw. Tony stands beside him, gauntlets directed towards other approaching Doombots. “Hey, Tony. After we’re done with clean-up here, would you like to—”
Their banter had been so easy and familiar, but Steve had also kept noticing how handsome Tony looked in his dark navy shirt and blue jeans, the way Tony kept blushing whenever Steve’s hand ended up near his whenever they both reached for the popcorn bowl at the same time. It made him hope, desperately.
Steve tightens his grip on the edge of his sketchpad as he turns back to the paper in front of him, stretching out his legs so as to better balance the weight of it on his knees. His pencil hovers over the page, ready to make its mark, but Steve pauses just before it hits the paper, heaving a quiet sigh.
Jan looks up. “What’s up, sleepyhead?” she asks, while Bucky crows about his victory over Sam in their third match.
“Actually, I haven’t seen him for a few days. Not since he dropped by my room on Tuesday. He seemed kind of jittery and out of it, so I thought maybe he just pulled another all-nighter and needed some sleep.”
Tony huffs, freeing himself from Pepper's final touches. "I've been kidnapped before. I'll survive it."
He had tried to move on. Had spent four months dating Sharon Carter, had gone out twice with the lady from Accounting and spent a week working out his frustrations in bed with a man in Johannesburg.
All that's important about Tony is in his head already - the rest of the scandals, rumors and indiscretions are not for Steve to think about.
If they don't find Tony - Steve remembers that final conversation with the man that he loved, that he loves now, in spite of everything.
“Only for you,” Tony promises, feeling his worry suddenly well up with a fierceness that terrifies him. JARVIS knows most of what needs to be done, but there’s so much more they don’t know, and his time is slipping away. “Tell Steve I’m sorry we missed our date.”
zone existed. A hysterical part of him thinks that as an innovator, he might as well be forging new discoveries in romance too.
Shoving their joined hands back into his warm pocket, Tony slowly starts their walk again, the Tower a bright beacon in the distance.
“Are you admitting I’m right?” Steve teases gently. He doesn’t expect an answer, so Tony doesn’t give one.
"Then let me ask you this, Tony: why haven’t you shown your Steve to the world? Are you afraid of something? Are you afraid he won’t stay when he knows the truth about your life? About
“With all due respect, sir,” Steve bites out, “I think the best way to keep our country safe isn’t through war.”
From the tray, Steve picks up a plastic spoon, but when Tony reaches out to take it, he gets his hand swatted away.
Rogers sets down a mug of black coffee on their table, holding a bottle of beer. “Nat told me you might like a coffee better than lime soda, Doctor Stark.” He sits across the table, next to Carol. Visibly, she adjusts her jacket, resting her chin on her hand.
The words hang between them, a chasm of differences Tony’s only beginning to realise. It should have been the first hint that they wouldn’t work, but they’re both young, and Tony leaps easily across the first cracks, eager, curious, innocent.
Good enough. Still, everything’s a learning experience, and as they start pushing the gurney away from the ambulance’s flaring lights, Tony adds, “fractured ribs from the fire extinguisher falling on him.”
Because Steve is sitting at the edge of their bed, the paper in his hands reading out in bold letters:
"Agent Fury is replacing her, yes." That's a thought. Fury has a direct line to SHIELD's most classified, last resort asset named Captain Danvers. "But Peggy will still have her contacts, people she can call in favors."
He had kept writing letter after letter for three more years until the stack of returned letters had grown too large to maintain.
Suddenly, the coffee cup isn't in his hand anymore, and Steve has a cloth pressed against the lingering drops of spilled coffee on his fingers, the softness of it soothing to Tony's tender skin.
Tony considers that, buttoning down his dress shirt. Red, because he wants to be ostentatious, with gold buttons because that is what they'd expect out of a spoiled heir with his father finally gone.
Together with him, Steve rolls the gurney into the ER, parking it next to a free hospital bed. Then, with Mrs. Carter gripping Steve’s arm tight, they lift her onto the bed, taking special care with her cut up legs.
Steve had worked with the equally brilliant Pepper Potts to seal the vacuum of leadership, issuing a government order to freeze any legal proceedings that gave company control to Stane.
He’s rewarded with a bark of laughter, accompanied by a grin. “You’re not unsuspecting, and you’re not a patient either, Captain.” The grin fades into something smaller. “But Kamala's family is fine?” Stark asks.
He misses the human Jarvis, but the Jarvises are safe in their retirement hideout and this JARVIS is just as real.
Frowning, he glances at the clock. Oh. It's two in the morning, and with Peggy retiring, the more prickly Agent Fury is on the phone. Steve forges onwards.
“Here,” Steve stands, taking the medical coat from over the chair and holding it up for Stark to turn and slip it on easily. It’s an act that Steve has done for Bruce many times before, one that he’s sure interns have done for Stark too, so he shouldn’t be overstepping anything.
So he tucks the two of them away where nobody can see them, this secret he wraps carefully in his heart. No one will ever be able to use it against them, Tony promises.
“You’re not getting into that surgery tomorrow if you don’t do that lady’s post-op paperwork,” Tony points out.
He uses the force of the spin to push them both down to the ground - the duck and cover move geared into his bones from fighting battles in the forties - and it helps make the impact -
Steve barks a laugh. Heading to the kitchen, he rummages through the fridge to get her favorite lime juice, pouring two glasses of it. "I don't know if I can be her Captain either."
"I'm sending the Jarvises away. They shouldn't be caught in the crossfire." He doesn't know why he's admitting this to Steve, except for the fact that Tony has more scotch in his blood than is healthy right now. He can't take Steve's careful touches, or the hushed footsteps of the Board of Directors, the worried whispers between Pepper and Rhodey.
“Will you stop bringing it up if I get our wedding caterers to keep the fruits and the pizzas separate?”
He walks over to the window and perches at its sill, taking the time to notice the smaller details that had escaped him. There was a sketch of a woman pinned to the wall next to Steve’s bed, and beside it, a crude drawing of a grinning, long-haired boy.
"Actually, this isn't so bad. The view's nice, don't you think?" Tony decides. Yeah. He could get used to a view like this.
The flash of cameras change directions and seats clatter to the floor, the room clearing in a rustle of yells and curses - because right there, three meters away from Tony is a reporter.
She isn't alone, however. Beside her, eyebags dark and hair sticking out wildly, is Stark. He's half leaning on Carol, the white medical coat that's usually on him is slung on his shoulders.
"That doesn't mean you can't die!" Tony yells again, and it feels good in a twisted way, letting his pent up frustrations be heard, because
"I was never his legacy," Tony hisses, old bitterness seeping back up through the cracks of wounds he isn't sure will ever heal. "He wanted better than me."
The slightest upward tip of her lips tells Steve she's gotten what she wanted from this roundabout session: confirmation that Stane was spooked by the investigation for deeply
“Ruining other people’s lives just because you can shouldn’t be your business either,” Steve doesn’t budge an inch, standing between the flowerbeds and the trio.
Preferring to hold onto the clipboard, Tony gives the Captain his friendliest customer service smile. “Right, Mr. Rogers, unless you have a problem other than oversized muscles crowding up my ER, you’re free to go back to sliding down poles.”
"Agent Wilson is flying over the desert. With Rhodes and Barnes on the field, I need you at headquarters," Peggy insists. "You're going to finish what we started before Howard Stark's crash."
grown," Sarah's smile grows smaller but fonder, so similar to her son's that Tony has a hard time looking at the brightness of it. "You've grown smarter, taller, and handsomer, dear."
He knew that announcing Stark Industries' slow expansion into defensive gear instead of offensive measures would rattle some feathers, but it was a compromise he had been able to shove under the door to keep the road open for future change: with the investigation still in full swing, Obie had finally relented, agreeing to give the go ahead for products less prone to being sold in the black market.
"I, uh, wanted to see you?" Tony blinks at him, twisting his hands together before pocketing his lock picks and rocking slightly back on his heels. There's something muted about him now that he isn't yelling at Bucky, a hesitance that might even be
Compensating for the lack of grounds in the city, the mansion’s garden was small, the short pathway leading right up to the terraced entrance, its marble pillars imposing, the brown bricks distant instead of homely.
“Make my father like me," Tony quips quickly. "But, really it's no big deal to make an arm. The best way to keep our country safe isn’t war, and I need to make him like me - ” Tony's phone rings, and he rolls his eyes at it. Another, louder ring. "Ah, shit. Sorry, gotta go. Nosy shareholders wanna know what I'm up to."
The thought burns the back of his throat, swelling there until he can't hold it in, and he lets slip a guttural sound of frustration.
The answer comes in rote. "Village rescue mission." That was what it was supposed to be. "Somehow the other side got American weapons and they didn't want us to know how much or where from," Steve stops, shutting his eyes, the screams still too loud. "They blew the place to kingdom come."
He's aware that he has a type. Ty: tall and blonde. Whitney: equally blonde and whipsmart. Apparently, that list now includes Steve: tall, blonde,
Steve is quick to nod. “You saved them. They wouldn't have survived the evacuation. Thor stopped the fire before the heat seeped into the NICU's fire compartment.”
Stranded between the floors of the Mansion, Steve stares through the pitch black at the end of the corridor.
The tabletop was the finest marble, the ceramic was the rarest china, and the silverware set for three people.
"Pep," he sighs, "you know you experience some things and then they're over and you still can't explain them?"
Tony thinks of the loudness of his weapons firing. There was a time once when he sought to make them as loud as possible, so that their firing would shake people to their bones. It was stupid and daft, and here, where all he can hear is Steve's breathing and the steady, crashing waves, he thinks he can be reminded of the wondrous world he'd tried to destroy.
And despite everything that's happened between the two of them, that had to count for something, didn't it?
“I heard you’re staying over for Christmas,” Tony says accusingly as he flings open Steve’s door. “Didn’t you want to get
Tony wants to ask, the doubts still choking despite his want to forgive. What was that quote about forgiveness and forgetting? It was the forgetting which he couldn't do, and that meant no matter how much he forgave, he couldn't ever let himself get close to Steve again, his heart still stinging from years of being left behind.
It’s a dream that feels real. Tony is buzzing with it. A new world without bloodshed, without hunger, without death. Nobody needed to suffer like Steve did everyday, he could finally make something
"I'm sorry they didn't reach you when they were meant to," the words tumble out of Steve, collapsing years of practicing what he'd say if he ever got to talk with his friend again. "I'm not - what did you call it? - in a league with Howard. I came for that brunch at the mansion because I - I wanted to see you, and I'm sorry I didn't listen to you when you said going to war wasn't the way out, and - "
Tony gives him a sharply bewildered look. "My mother must be keeping Howard company. She needs no assistance from me."
But not as formidable as them. Bucky's metal arm serves as another tool to use against the pirates, clunky and painful to wear but effective as a hunk of metal to smack people down.
Yeah, no. If he's forced to attend these travesties, he'll do what he can to make them less mind-numbing.
Softly, Steve clears his throat, nudging Tony’s ribs until Tony ignores the adults talking and turns around. That isn’t proper decorum, but he doubts that Sarah cares.
They're barely ten feet away, now, and Tony's squint becomes more pronounced. Steve watches numbly, uncomprehendingly, as Tony adjusts his grip on Rhodey's shoulder. In sync, Rhodey's hand moves around Tony's waist to prop him up.
He should have known that Steve would rise up to that challenge. It wouldn’t end well in any universe. He can imagine Steve standing firm against Howard, achieving nothing except making him angrier at Tony, and likely ruining Steve’s life for the audacity.
It's been a week since the HYDRA attack. Steve should've known a nightmare was bound to happen soon.
And oh, that's a mistake. Tony pauses, turning on his heel to face Steve, eyes wide. Steve can practically hear the lightning-fast gears in Tony's head turn, clicking into place.
Finding none, Tony slumps into Steve's hold, hiding his face in the crook of Steve's arm, back trembling the slightest bit as Steve returns the hug, slotting perfectly home.
Spending time with Steve was much less boring. Already, he was thinking of ways to get around them all.
“You have every right to be happy, Tony,” it should be a gentle thing to say, but the way Carol says it is more of a tired argument.
It's a good Christmas. Better than the last. And if Tony feels upset at not being given the slightest acknowledgement from Howard, then he locks his bedroom and opens up the pages Steve sent.
Until he manages to convince Tony of the truth: that given the choice, Steve wouldn't willingly leave Tony again - he has his sketchbook and this growing collection of moments kept in charcoal gray.
call us a bunch of dunderheads," Tony chuckles, "or at least, I think that's what she said in Russian. But I guess... go out with me?”
"Can you escort the Captain out, too?" Tony pleads to the Agent, who freezes and shakes his head, forcing Tony to deal with a bomb about to blow
Saving both Steve and Tony at the same time isn’t possible. They have to prioritise, and with the odds stacked already so much against Tony, the choice is purely logical.
“Steve has a greater chance of survival,” Tony takes refuge in the facts, hard and clean and easy. “Get the obstruction out and the pressure off his spine, and the serum will save him. I’m just a baseline person and the arc reactor damage – I know my numbers. I know you’ll do your best to save me.”
The sting of guilt is sharper, because Steve has heard hushed whispers of what Joseph Rogers had been like before he left a pregnant Sarah behind to fight another war.
“No,” Tony tries his best to sound indignant while already half asleep. Then, he rethinks. “Yes. Actually, no.” He pauses. “I was hopin’ for a kiss too,” he struggles to shape the words. “Guess I’ll settle for do’uts instead.”
"He grew up with you, has known you for more than a decade. I doubt anyone would call that rushing."
, a small childish voice in him wants to cry. But he's cried enough tears over her, and he has no grief over Howard. Only a strange emptiness that left him adrift.
Yet, it’s hard not to draw his own conclusions that it’s very likely Tony has affections for the scientist he spends much of his day with, and Bruce is certainly smarter than Steve could ever hope to be.
“If you’re happy, I don’t want to hear about it," Steve lets out a ragged breath, fists clenched at his sides, back straight. A soldier facing adversity. "And if you’re getting married, I don’t want to see it. I can't, I can't say goodbye to you again – but. But if you need somebody and there’s no one else to turn to," Steve turns to their bedside drawer, where a sketch of them by Steve was framed, "if you need a friend, if you come through a rainy patch and you need a shield, you can always find me.”
He can hear Tony's eye roll. "Hit the posterior hatch of the goddamned bots," Tony says dryly, swooping low to fly in front of Steve and shoot the robot advancing on him.
“Does this mean we’re not arguing anymore?” Tony asks, and he realises he must be far drowsier than he thought if he’s asking pointless questions.
He flips over to the next letter from the pile surrounding him. His looping cursive mingles with the blocky letters that even boarding school hadn't been able to train out of Tony.
Part of Tony doesn’t want to know the answer, doesn’t want to know how much time Steve had decided to spare for Tony. A larger part
"Is that why you're investigating Howard - or the company, at least - for fraud?" Tony asks, sharp and all too-knowing.
Eventually, Jarvis opens a glass door that leads out to a private garden enclosed in the heart of the mansion.
Swallowing down the guilt, Steve flips through another batch of files, hesitating only the slightest bit when he realises that they're hacked from SHIELD - details about a strange blue alien cube to do with clean energy, all of Steve's personnel files, analysis about the weak points of Steve's body armor and notes on upgrade requirements.
The last time Tony had been this close to him, they'd been teenagers, children who didn't know how much they had to lose.
The cut on his forehead, which should be ugly and marring, just serves to make Steve even more defiantly, annoyingly adorable – a giant of a man with an even larger heart.
Beside him, Tony has already taken advantage of Liberty’s newfound trust, handfeeding her some more dog treats.
Steve's blonde hair has taken a grayish color from that same dust, but Tony can swear the tired smile on his face is among the most blessed sights he's seen, more blessed than the Vatican.
Steve adds the number to his contacts before he replies, fingers hovering over the small keyboard of his phone as he struggles to come up with an appropriately neutral but not too severely neutral reply.
, Clint would say. Except, that isn't the reason: Steve knows what it's like to lose someone, knows the dread of waiting for someone to come home, the late nights and dinners growing cold when they don't make it. He admires Jane's fortitude for loving a man who she might lose any day, for loving Thor who has given his heart to the duty of saving others first.
But generally, being impaled with a rebar and trapped under the massive pile of rubble that used to be New York City Hall is among the unfortunate parts of the Avenging job. And having a two hundred pound suit caving into your stomach was the Iron–Man–specific misfortune.
“And exercise is healthy, unlike all the space you’re taking up for that ambulance coming up down the road.”
Now, more than ever, he feels his pacemaker whirr in his chest. “No biggie, then,” he flashes a smile at her.
Steve’s thumb brushes over the arc of Tony’s cheek. “You saved me. And we’re going to have a very long talk about acceptable risks, but for now Doctor Cho wants you to sleep, so I’ll take a raincheck on being angry at you.”
"I don't need to be protected. I need to fix this, I need to know if somehow my parents had to be buried because you thought it necessary to dig through the company's dirt."
He needs this to work. He’s one month late from the deadline, and while usually he has no trouble skipping happily over time limits, the Stark Intellicrops are about
Torn between laughing and frowning, Steve decides on the former. It's easier to smile when Tony is around. "I'm gonna need you to make some armor," he takes the napkins gratefully.
"An architectural impossibility," Tony shrugs. "A piece of cake. This is much warmer than New York, anyways, and much nearer to the hot parties."
"Tell you what, you let me keep my Steve, and I'll let you keep my Captain A-bear-ica," Tony fishes out a merchandise teddy bear sporting the A helmet and an American flag.
Giving a wink up to Doctor Strange on the OR’s observatory deck, Tony takes the scalpel offered to him by a nurse, and turns it out so its handle points at Sam. “You’re making the first cut today.”
Tony can't quite tell if Rogers' slanted lips are a sign of disapproval or amusement. “Everything is good in moderation,” he shrugs at the Captain.
Steve wishes they didn’t have to do it right in the middle of December, with the sloshy thin sheet of snow making the weather miserable despite the bright lights and cheerful carols. But Sam had been so excited about the idea, Steve didn’t have the heart to turn him down so near to Christmas.
Pouting, Tony pokes back at Steve's stomach. "My leg doesn't even hurt anymore." The doctors will fix it in five hours tops, and he can get back to his priorities: trying to kiss that smirk off Steve's face without turning everything into an enormous disaster. With the investigation going on, Steve tasked to protect him, and their friendship hanging in the balance, things were bound to get messy.
people find fun to be good in moderation,” Carol winks at Tony. “Thought I managed to scare you off this bar's turf, Rogers.”
Steve has no choice except to leave Maria with Howard and remember to later file a request for extra protection assigned to her. Howard Stark might hold legal ownership over the company, but it was Maria who held the fragile empire together.
Rhodey shouts something - and suddenly Sam is back, tugging Steve out of the second chopper towards the one Tony is in, half dragging Steve's feet through the sand.
Never look a gift horse in the mouth, yeah – Tony doubts the ancient Greek had to resist that All-American smile.
That Steve looks good is a simple fact Tony's grown used to over the years. That Steve looks good enough to eat?
Steve leans back, head thunking against the front door, feeling the tension and the fear of the day leave him in a rush. He’s lightheaded, dizzy from the sudden burst of adrenaline.
"I was afraid that he would push me away again if I came back. I don't want to hurt him more," Steve admits. Then, "I'm done being afraid."
Tony wants to push, disappointment mingled with desperation and stubbornness. But he doesn’t want to anger Howard or Obie. Things were hard enough without them being unhappy about Tony, too.
“Coffee,” Tony slides his empty cup back to her. “I need more coffee if I have to survive a twelve-hour shift
“I'll wait for Thor to finish with the wires,” an equally ruffled voice replies, and Tony barely resists groaning when he hears its familiar stubbornness.
Placatingly, Tony pats DUM-E's claw, tossing a stray gear to the other end of the workshop for his troublesome child to fetch.
’ from Tony after the god creates a thunderstorm strong enough to rescue Tony from having to attend a backyard party in the Hamptons.
Steve's other hand curls around Tony's waist, large and warm. The last time they'd stood this close, Tony had been the taller one, fearful that he'd crush Steve's bony knuckles.  Now, with nerves panicking, he searches for things to ground himself in: the feel of Steve's rough calluses against his palm - a soldier's hands - the bright chandelier above them, the whispers of people around them, the easy security that Steve was
When Steve makes a move to poke at his stitches, Tony bats his fingers away, grabbing at them when they resist.
Rolling up the sleeves of her leather jacket, Carol gives Tony a smirk that he's come to associate with unfavorable things for himself. “More a matter of principle,” she says, “but my morals say I can’t let you mope around town alone for much longer.”
Tony kicks him under the table, grinning back. “How about tonight? Here?” Tony counters. “I’m guessing you haven’t eaten since Libby was attacked. We can order a pizza?”
"This isn't working," Tony quietly says. Maybe if he does it quietly, it doesn't have to hurt too much. "You and me, it can't work."
Instead, he makes his way down to the workshop, presses in the security code, and makes his way to the sketchbook he left on the couch there.
With that, Tony pulls away, striding off to pick up his medical kit and his coat, Steve dazedly following him out to the front door, into the dark winter night. Liberty sticks close, whining when Tony pats her goodbye.
"Keep him safe from himself," Howard goes on despite Maria's subtle attempts at getting him to stop.
He thinks of his weapons firing away, gunshots ringing loud with death, and he pushes against the bile that rises up.
Tony barks out a laugh, lips tipping up into a careful smile. "But it is. Nice. Very you." He waves the paintbrush at the framed picture of Steve, Bucky, and Sam in the deserts. "Didn't expect I'd meet your legendary Bucky Barnes like that."
He is nowhere near the dignity, honor, kindness that Steve represents, and by accepting Steve's protection, Tony submits to the very real possibility that Steve might take the fall for Tony's sins.
Peggy seems appeased at that, critically assessing the truth on Steve's face and the pain of his heart that must be echoed there. Finally standing up, her heels click at the small distance between them.
, Steve thinks for the second time in five minutes. “I, uh,” he stares at the yellow post-it in Tony's hand. “I was doing some thinking.”
They’ve only lived together for seven months, but Steve had found himself drawn to how Tony represented everything
When Stark doesn’t immediately throw Steve out of the crowded emergency room, the small thrill of victory makes Steve stand up straighter.
Occasionally, the few magazines from home would feature Tony with Ty and Sunset and a whole host of other celebrities Steve didn't care for.
Tony kisses him, hot and desperate and giving Steve everything he needs, everything he wants. There's the aftertaste of salt from Tony's fears. Steve pushes past that, cradling the back of Tony's head, tangling himself in the roots of Tony's hair, pulling and pushing until they topple, Tony landing on top of him with a
Tony laughs almost ruefully, ducking his head. “I’m not your therapist, but there’s not much going against your Tinder profile.” A shrug. “Sam told me about you: Medal of Honor recipient moonlighting as a freelance artist, respectable brownstone in Brooklyn, and I’m guessing a fit body beneath all those sweaters.”
"No," Tony admits, putting down the brush. "A few years ago Pep - my PA slash godsent savior - noticed this error in our books, and I used to think it was an honest mistake. I had her look back at it last night," he rummages inside his pocket and takes out a small device. "here. You should have a look."
, DUM-E, put that down, that’s Steve’s anniversary gift, it’s off limits,” Tony sighs, rubbing the bridge of his nose tiredly.
It’s a cloudy night when Tony finally admits it to Steve, the churning pit in his stomach. The pool of horror slowly growing larger in him.
“I’m not a Spice Girl,” Tony resists the urge to thunk his forehead on the bar table. “I don’t need Rogers adding more chaos to my ER.”
Steve finally reaches across the tiny space and takes Tony’s hand in his, squeezing. “I’m sorry, too.”
Rhodey rolls his eyes. “I had to drag your ass out of dumpsters in college because you were too busy mooning over him – ”
This time around, there wasn’t a fire when they had been called out. A local school had a major lab accident, and while Thor and Bruce had stopped it from becoming worse, the lab teacher had gotten some deep glass cuts in her shin.
In the late summer, the winds are starting to pick up, which sends the tails of Doctor Stark’s medical coat whipping around his bright red scrubs.
A practiced line, said so many times to so many thankful soldiers who'd never know that the hands that dreamt up those blood-stained guns and missiles were the same hands that once planted flowers of
“You’re not going to die on us, Tony. We’ll find a way,” Natasha’s voice returns again, and he hears Bruce, Clint, Thor, his entire family repeat the same sentiment, and Tony isn’t going to cry.
The moment slips away from him, one aberration of many, and Tony’s hand remains very much free of a ring that Steve wonders about but doesn’t dare to ask.
The longer he waits to talk with Steve, the worst their argument will go, and he supposes that he might as well accomplish something today. Repair his relationship with Steve.
"Fine. But I'm going out with Sam," he huffs at Steve. "The place better not be burned down when we get back."
For a moment, Steve thinks it's enough, but the moment ends and Tony's lips twist again. "I don't care. I don't give a
"Next time, you ride with me," he hears Rhodey say even from this distance, and that's - that's Tony in his arms. Unmistakably Tony.
Tony flinches at the name, harder than usual. Had his captors called him that? Steve gives the doctor a warning look before promising, "we'll get you pudding then. And some warm, sweet coffee."
"If Obie or Howard asks about it," Tony cuts in, because he wasn't ready yet to wrap his head around the idea of Pepper and Steve colluding, "tell them I've gotten a burst of maturity and I think the LA Headquarters could benefit from senior leadership."
They jump off into the cloud of dust that's starting to settle down, and Steve hears some soldiers coughing. He follows Rhodey's lead, the faint sound of lone shouts guiding them both.
"Because Howard wanted him to. Howard was slipping away, driven to paranoia by enemies he couldn't see," her hand rises to Tony's shoulder, its weight settling there, "and he wanted to protect his legacy."
“Let us do the hard work,” Rhodey says, and Tony can imagine the fond smile that must be on Rhodey’s lips, tired, ever–faithful. “You just keep holding on.”
“There’s no need to be polite, Captain. I know my son. He wouldn’t have made it out of the supersoldier program like you did,” Howard waves away his words, “you’re the only one of America’s best men strong enough for it.”
“Bruce didn't have time to stitch it up,” Steve eventually explains, “and Officer Gamora needs more help than me.”
And yet. And yet, there was something reassuring to the fact that someone as upstanding and true as Steve might see Tony - blood and all, sins and all - as a person worth saving.
work. "If we don’t take risks, we don’t grow. Besides," Tony digs up his memory of last Monday's meeting, "making something new might quiet the activist protests.”
"Howard and Maria. The news hasn't broken yet, but - Steve. A car crash on the way to the airport." Even over the unstable line, Steve can hear Peggy's breath hitch. "No survivors."
But if he calculates the trajectory well enough, he's nearly sure that Steve's serum will heal him quick enough from any burns or bruises.
"If it takes interns to make millions of dollars worth of weapons to disappear," Peggy raises her brow, remaining seated, back ramrod straight, "I daresay your company has serious need for reform."
Steve nods, quickly dodging out of the doorway. Remembering the new size of his body comes easier when he isn't this tense. Before Ana leaves, she places a quick peck on Tony's cheek, whispering, "you never told me he was
"Would you like to, I dunno, have another coffee some time?" he offers when Tony dawdles some more. He knows more than most that Tony is a busy man, but if Tony's still lingering here, then, "Ma would love to see you again, and I'll keep Buck from biting you."
She slips in the space between Steve and Tony on the couch, leaning her head on Tony’s shoulder and taking a blueberry for herself. “I’ll marry you when you’re an inch taller.”
Steve leans back against the stairs and lets out a long, slow sigh. He’s not sure he has the right words to describe exactly how he feels right now, or even if he knows all of what he’s feeling. But Jan’s here, and she’s his friend, and maybe if he gets this off his chest and tells someone, he’ll have better luck making sense of it.
On any other night, he would have been thrilled at Tony’s question, relishing the chance to hold Tony close in his arms. But tonight, his nerves have been scraped raw by the many curious gossipers at the gala who have either been cooing after Clint and Tony or hounding Steve with questions, clearly angling for fresh details on the so-called hottest couple of the year.
“Sounds good.” Foggy smiles before darting another glance at Matt. He rocks back on his heels. “I hate to cut this short, but I should probably be getting back.”
These days, all he draws when he picks up his pencil is Tony. Tony,  half-asleep in the morning, looking bleary-eyed and unfairly adorable, Tony working on new versions of the Iron Man suit, Tony gesturing at JARVIS with a wrench in his hand, looking outraged, Tony at a party…
Foggy leans in to press a kiss to Matt’s cheek, and the happiness Steve feels for his new friend is so strong it blossoms into something like an ache in the middle of his chest.
“Perfect,” Steve says, ducking his head. He doesn’t understand why, but as he looks at Tony, it feels like his heart has suddenly flown into his throat.
“It's nothing, Hawkeye. I'm alright. Just feeling nervous, that's all. SHIELD is counting on us and this needs to go well. You know I’m not a big fan of undercover missions. I don’t like putting any of the team in unnecessary danger.”
“If you stay, I’m sure I can provide you with a proper distraction,” Tony says, now sounding more awake by the second.
If he ever gets the courage to ask Tony out on a date like he’s been wanting to for months, he might even get a chance to kiss Tony on those sleepy mornings. Steve feels a sliver of want curl through him at the thought.
“I just took a shower,” Steve explains, tossing his used towel into the laundry basket. When he turns to face Tony again, Tony’s expression looks almost glassy. It’s gone with a shake of his head and Steve wonders if he had imagined it.
Jan bites her lip, shaking her head. “I’ll admit I thought about setting you guys up for a second, but I haven’t mentioned it to him yet and I won’t if you’re not comfortable with it.” She glances at Nat before looking back at Steve. “It can just be a friendly coffee chat, entirely platonic if you want.”
Not that Steve minds, really. He knows he’s been the cause of Tony arriving late to the lab more than once over the last three months since they’ve gotten together, and he has no regrets about it.
“You know, Steve? Jan was right, you really are good at this.” Foggy glances up from scribbling a few notes on the margins of his sketches and shoots Steve a smile. “I honestly can’t thank you enough. And you have excellent opinions on hobbits and Star Wars.”
“Yep. I know you usually take your coffee black, but when you’re in a bad mood you actually take it with milk and three sugars. I know you like to read Jules Verne every Christmas. I know you once painted DUM-E purple when you were half-asleep and you were the one who lost Bruce’s pants that time. I know every single one of your smiles - yes, including that one. I know you steal my shirts to sleep in, no matter how many times you try to deny it. I know that Rhodey was the first friend you really trusted, and Pepper was the second. I know you think it’s cute when I sing show-tunes in the shower even when I’m horribly off-key. I know you are brave, loyal, and kind, and you have the heart of a hero. I know I’m lucky because I get to be the one next to you, to be the one to hold your hand.
He doesn’t know why he’s telling Tony – maybe this most recent failure hit harder than he thought. Steve only knows that he expects Tony to react somehow. A soldier swinging both ways isn’t the most common thing. Stack it up with PTSD and a very protective service dog – the odds aren’t really in Steve’s favor.
“Our ambulance got the driver out already. That was the worst of it,” she reports, “Banner went with the ambulance. We called for back up ‘cause some of these Nozzle Heads got hurt doing a bit of lifting.”
Is it Steve’s fault that he has a distaste for electronics when they tend to make him have to suit up?
“Perfectly steady, Doc, great for delicate surgery,” Sam pipes up, untying his surgical gown, spirits far too happy for having just cut open a woman. “Much better than Doctor Hammer.”
Maria's fever spikes. Tony takes a dose of the medicine the nurses were supposed to administer and pumps it into her IV.
Getting Steve far away was also necessary, but that was another mountain Tony doesn't have the energy to climb. Maybe he's too selfish to try.
“Captain Danvers has gossip,” Kamala walks over, sitting on Tony’s left, and now Tony is surrounded on three sides by three ladies far too invested in his happiness. “Your life is work and more work, Doctor Stark.”
He walks over to the punching bag by the dining table, Liberty following along. There’s no drawing tonight, and if there’s no drawing, then he's sure he won't be able to get any sleep either.
turned out to be bad eggs. Rumlow had been a cheating ass, and Liberty had scratched Rumlow so badly that stitches were needed. The same thing had happened to Rollins who Steve had nearly punched in the face for what the man was doing behind Steve’s back.
Tony turns fourteen and he doesn’t tell anyone. Ty and Sunset forget. Steve doesn’t know. Jarvis sends him a letter and a bag of cookies.
“Still winning as a kebab,” Tony tells her, because he doesn’t know how much longer he can keep it together, and humor is always a good distraction.
Steve speeds up his steps, taking the stairs three at a time. Being able to run was always something he was grateful to the serum for, and he's doubly grateful for it now.
He’s also been happily introduced to the notion that ‘a lady waiting at home’ was far too restrictive. Only, he hadn’t expected to get an example of the new modern ideals so quickly.
"I'm always careful," Tony wipes his hand on his tank top, adding even more grease on it. Some of their school's etiquette lessons, however, seem to have stayed with Tony because he offers Steve one of the paper napkins. "I've slept with hundreds of women and never gotten any of the horrors from sex ed, and I've slept with
Even without the worst of the names on the list, however, there were still nuisances such as the young Justin Hammer who seemed keen on breaking up Tony's lively conversation with Miss van Dyne.
Some misguided feeling that maybe this could heal their wounds instead of pressing against them, making them bleed more?
He's clinging to the last dregs of their blissful year sneaking around for clandestine dates and finding rest in each other's breaths, before his world had come crashing down and he was made CEO by force.
She shifts moves the toolbox to the floor and sits on the workbench across him. Her handbag is dumped on top of it. DUM-E, the traitor, rolls across the small lab to beep happily at her.
The shrill sound of the kettle boiling interrupts them, and Peggy takes it to pour the water into a teapot. She shuffles her way to the old radio in the corner, flicking it on.
Getting in wasn’t the hard part. Younger than everyone, Tony is small and growing thinner now that Jarvis can’t sneak pies onto his plate.
He hasn't known what to do with himself since Rhodey had dropped off the thick pile of envelopes a month ago, and he knew it was only a matter of time before Pepper's patience ran out.
“Ah,” Steve turns to Liberty lying on top of a nest of old blankets. He feels awkward, now that the main business is over. “Do you want to wash up?” Dog slobber isn’t the most pleasant thing to have on your face after a while, and it’ll give Steve some time to think of what to say.
He’s trying to play the piano, but the notes slip and slide away from him until Steve puts down his paintbrush to sit next to him on the piano bench.
“I don’t know you well,” Tony shrugs, pretending. Steve doesn’t like him, but Tony’s attended enough parties and been taught how to get others to talk.  Gaze darting to the blank canvases, he asks an easier question. “You draw much?”
They go in the same strand of futile negotiations for several more minutes before Howard decides to leave. Peggy rises with him, and Steve stops Stane from following.
Except Steve has known him since before he knew how to lie properly, since all his tells were for the world to see. Through the small patches of sun falling over his face, he watches with dread as Steve's frown softens back to his earlier smile.
Everything would be empty, Howard would keep tipping back the next bottle of overpriced whiskey, and Obie would always have his eyes on the
, Steve thinks as Liberty rests her head on Tony’s thigh. The question is, of course, whether the reverse was true.
Tony learns that he’d been out for a month because they had needed to use the Cradle to regenerate almost all of his midsection, while Steve had needed a spinal surgery before the supersoldier serum could take over to properly heal him.
Steve pastes a friendly smile on his face despite his confusion. In the few months since they moved into the Tower, Steve hasn’t seen Tony this relaxed or playfully happy. That’s the reason – the
But if Tony knew Steve, it was also true that Steve knew Tony, and he glared at him. “You hacked the mainframe, didn’t you?”
Slowly, Steve watches Sam nod. Rhodey's back stiffens immediately, orders to land shouted out by reflex. The words ring in Steve's ears.
Most likely sensing Steve’s uncomfortable confusion, Tony’s gaze finds Steve’s. “You want to try some?” he extends the prized plate outwards.
The wound on the girl's arm is nothing too serious, but, “Doctor Wilson,” Stark immediately calls out to another doctor, “get us some antibiotic cream and a saline bag.”
Disappointing Steve was the worst, wasn't it? "You should go, Cap. I'm sure the sun won't be the thing that kills me today."
Steve knew better than most how difficult it had been for Tony to grow up and be told that the greatest good he could possibly do was to make better weapons.
"He cares about you. When this is all over and we aren't in danger anymore," his mother's smile turns wistful, "you should take him to Italy. He will like the art, you will like the wine and his touch."
Before the ambulance arrives, though, he has one last thing to do in their small bubble of privacy: he presses a kiss on Tony's knuckles.
“Hey, hey” Steve’s warm hand cups Tony’s cheek, “slow down. What matters is that you’re alright now.”
Searching about Tony on the internet feels unfair, especially when Steve's own profile is guaranteed to be far less prolific.
Steve thinks of his Ma, who must be sleeping as peacefully as Tony right now, and he thinks of Maria Stark -
Tony scrunches his nose, eyes closed. “Ugh,” he mutters, hands moving to pat Liberty’s head, knocking onto Steve’s hand on her collar. Steve freezes. He watches tensely as Tony peeks open an eye, waiting for the curses and the anger to come spitting out of Tony, and he’s –
"Hold up," Steve reaches across the table, taking out the clean end of the napkin. "You've got - " he swipes the sauce off the corner of Tony's lips. "Alright. Go on."
Swallowing, Tony moves his gaze away from those bulging biceps to the wound: it must've been something pretty sharp to cut through the thick layer of cloth from the discarded uniform.
Tony huffs, pointing at the blueprints for the next Stark fighter jets. "Obie wants those done by next week, and I'm thinking - I can install trackers on each item manufactured. I've thought of how to change the materials for the chips to make them even smaller. Howard and Obie won't even realise they're there."
know all that," Tony chuckles, sniffing back the pang of longing which came with the surprise that Steve carried all those little things with him through everything.
“No,” he unbuttons his uniform. His shift isn’t quite over yet, but with the soot from two emergency calls, it’s best to change into something cleaner. “His name’s Doctor Stark.”
“Well,” Steve gently puts the compass beside his StarkPad on their bedside table, and kisses Tony’s nose, “you have my full attention, Mr. Stark-Rogers.”
He mulls over that until Maria gets forced away by an acquaintance that he dodges, leaving him alone with Steve.
Howard's glaring absence adds another chasm between them. Their latest intelligence spotted Howard at a club on one of his private islands off in the Pacific.
"What? No." Tipping the rest of the blueberries into his mouth, he tosses the packet aside. "I'm done eating. We can do it now."
But with every barb that Tony throws at Steve, he's met with another barb that cuts beneath his attacks, burrowing under his armor to find the truth that Tony tries desperately to cover up again.
"Noted, Doc." The nurse smiles apologetically at them both before leaving, weaving her way through the bustling ER.
Sneaking a glance outside the window, Tony finds himself peering out onto the moonlit woods secluding the school from the rest of the world. If Steve wanted to play this game of stubbornness, Tony was more than ready to out-stubborn him.
"Who did you think gave Steve the scholarship to receive the best education?" Peggy confirms. "He went to school with you because he was to be the
"It might not be their fault at all. We were lucky to be able to get food out there, sending letters was a luxury," Steve shrugs. He would have liked receiving any word from Tony, and the bitter taste of late nights wondering what he'd done to ruin their friendship wouldn't go away anytime soon. But he likes far more that he's here again, back home against all odds, with a chance at fixing everything they'd twisted wrong.
“He’s done more for this country than you have with your trinkets, you’d do well to be more like him.”
"Hey buddy," Steve gives both bots a pat on their claws. "I miss Tony too." There are some truths easier to say to metal and steel and machine, who won't judge him for having a heart.
He says his goodbyes to Natasha and Carol, leaving a fat tip for Clint and Kamala to collect later. Steve offers Tony a ride home on his motorcycle, which Tony very quickly turns down because he doesn't know what he'll do if he has to be pressed against Steve and those insanely large shoulders.
A few minutes later, Tony walks out, wearing the same red shirt he had come with, hair floppy and wet. The dampness of it must’ve dripped down on Tony’s shirt, though, because wet spots on the shirt cling revealingly tight across Tony’s chest – hints of his collarbone peeking through.
He's in Stark Industries' Los Angeles office. Obadiah Stane wants control over the company to handle the fallout from the company losing not just leadership, but also the brilliance of Tony's genius.
that his legs buckle for the briefest moments. "Tony always said tea is leaf juice," he finds it in himself to smile.
. “But I need to know that whatever happens,” he winces through the pain, “whatever happens, you’ll all be fine.”
“She helps me with my – ” Steve makes a half-hearted shrug, still getting used to talking about it, “my PTSD.”
The timestamp is a second after the failed call to Pepper, and it's - there's fire in the background, on the right edge is the back wheels of what must be the humvees, and there's a man in uniform that is decidedly
Gracefully, Steve leads Maria to the center of the ballroom, swinging her in time with the light jazz. Tony switches the empty glass to nurse a tumbler of whiskey, trying to spot whoever Agent Morse was. He doesn't get much of a chance, though, with the Fitzgeralds coming over to try win a contract from him and the Secretary of Defense pestering him about the latest manufacturing timetable.
With that, and with a wide smile, the man walks away, right in time for the next ambulance to roll up the curb.
This is a test. A test of how far Steve is willing to go, how far Steve's faith in the agency, in himself, in his friends goes.
None of them have reached beyond four months, which – Tony thinks with no small amount of bittersweet pride – is two months less than how long Steve had been willing to bear with Tony. (And even if anyone managed to outlast Steve’s time with Tony, Tony has no right to deny Steve his happiness just because Tony never deserved that happily ever after).
. "I had JARVIS triangulate locations using MARIA," he tells Tony. "You should be meeting with a Commander Fury soon."
Instead, they head for the bar counter, Carol helping Stark up onto one of the tall bar chairs, and Natasha serves Stark one steaming mug of what must be coffee.
So all things considered, Tony has to concede that a few more days in the med wing might be warranted.
For the first time, Steve notices Stark. A handsome smile, a well-trimmed beard, and toned muscles that peek out from under his scrubs. Steve straightens his back, keeping a hand on Liberty’s neck to keep her from getting too agitated. He’s quite aware of what his own body looks like – after all, he
Dammit. He should be able to say this to Steve without resorting to petty sarcasm. He’s dated Steve for three whole years, it shouldn’t be hard –
Despite all the Christmases driving from the school to the city with Tony and Jarvis, Steve had never been here, and he’s here only because Colonel Phillips had been willing to send a letter of introduction to the Starks.
The blurry yellow blob in front of his face starts to come into focus, and he realises that it’s Steve’s blond hair, and Steve is
That's –  that's Tony's voice, coming from Steve's pocket. He glances at Carol's wide eyes, fishing out his phone and slowly asking, “Tony?”
Right. It’s a miracle enough that they’ve gone two weeks without any of this being brought up, and now that Tony can sit up and eat his own pudding, he supposes it’s natural that Steve’s pent up worries would bubble up.
Few people were fortunate enough to count someone as brilliant and kind as Tony a friend, and compared to Tony’s wealth, Steve has nothing except his nightmares and a dog too protective for her own good. He doesn’t want to miss his chance by waiting too long. He also doesn’t want to lose his chance by being too presumptuous.
He does know. He really does - has watched Tony protect himself since they were both too young and too foolish, using persistent guile and charm where Steve often preferred the brute force of stubborness.
Carol waits another second before she's satisfied. “Go on, Scrubs,” she lets go of his arm. “Give the hopeless Nozzle Heads a hand.”
They walk past a couple of carollers as they cross the street to Prospect Park’s Dog Beach. Sam leads them, talking about how maybe what Steve needed wasn’t a set up date. This final straw was supposed to be a spontaneous thing at a dog park – Sam hoping that Steve would spark a miraculous flame with fellow dog lovers.
Still, when Steve pays the bill and takes Liberty back from the clerk, Kate jumps back as Liberty rebelliously barks loudly, pulling at the leash.
“It can be a tiring job.” Stark clears his throat awkwardly, smile lopsided. “And I'm sure pole dancing is equally tiring.” He takes a step back to let a nurse pass between them, then gestures at Steve's uniform, “so, you, uh – thank you for your service, Captain.”
” Tony laughs, half hysterical. He marches to Steve, hands thrown in the air. “You’re jealous. You’re – the universe is laughing at me.”
"And I did my duty," Peggy turns away from the kettle to meet him with her steely gaze. "I kept my promise to your father, and I made sure their final will was held."
He feels like an intruder, awkward, as Tony grins up at Rhodey, bruised cheeks and all. "I missed you, honeybear," Tony says.
A thought comes to mind, guilt and fear mixing. They hadn't been enough. They failed a hundred times over, from the Ritz to this.
He had always doubted at some level that Rhodey meant what he said. He doubts even more the truth of Steve's words, especially when he's met Bucky and Sam and Sarah and the rest of Steve very un-fucked up family.
Coffee, bitter and warm. Tony’s lips press hard against him, pushing, and pushing Steve until Steve’s back hits the edge of the table and Liberty barks. Tony makes no pause, tongue swiping between Steve’s lips, hot and desperate and –
“Isn’t it against the law for the precinct to defend the fire department?” Tony tries another angle. "The blood fued rivalry thing?"
"Yeah, well," Tony flippantly replies from behind Steve, expertly massaging the salve across his shoulderblades. "I don't like it when you're hurt."
Ever since the car crash that had killed Howard, Maria, and nearly taken Tony too, he had felt indebted to the paramedics, doctors, nurses who had saved him. He had invented the world’s most invasive pacemaker to be able to escape being tied to a machine by a bed, and with his ticker problem out of the way, a year of physical therapy was more than enough for Tony to poke and prod the doctors for their knowledge – for someone with three PhDs, a proper MD was a walk in the park.
He hooks a hand around Steve's neck pulling him down - an impossible angle that somehow works as Steve turns pliant under his touch.
Sam had called the incident the Not-So-Secret-Admirer Aberration, gossiping with Lang about the fire captain, until Tony assigned them both to a day of boring stitching in the ER. Carol, however, was an entirely different problem, sending Tony unsubtle texts asking about his progress with Steve, telling Tony in no uncertain terms that he needed to get laid.
“I owe you everything,” Steve insists, because if he had forced Tony into this hellish cycle of war, Tony should at least understand that he
It is, of course, just his luck that Tony wanders to his room right then, his footsteps so familiar that Steve knows its him before he turns around. Tony freezes just outside the door, eyes flicking to the clothes scattered around the usually tidy room then to the suitcase.
October flips onto November. While Steve’s gotten a new commission to keep himself going, the new month also means a new date set up for him by his ever-wonderful friends. He had given them a deadline of December. No more setting him up with a gal from accounting or a guy from admin after that. For all that he wants to settle down, for all that he might be lonely, Liberty gives him enough company and enough reason to get up each morning.
Years of misplaced heartache and unread letters, and here his friend was, as brilliant and kind and maddening as Tony had always been.
Steve feels his hackles rising, confusion crashing against indignant anger. What was Tony accusing him of?
Rhodey bows his head. "I'll be back in New York in two days. I expect you to be there for the reading of - of Tony's will."
The holidays pass faster after he throws himself into work. Obie asks whether Tony made any improvements to the rockets, Tony comes up with rockets stronger than Howard could ever make them.
" - how can I not assume?" he hears Tony ask. "All these years, I've wondered, and now they're dining together?"
Peggy smiles right back. "I'm not looking for good. I'm interested in the truth, Mr. Stane, and until you're willing to help me find it, we have enough shovels to keep piling the dirt on your front lawn."
This time, Steve doesn't bother holding back his laugh. "I had to get your schedule from somewhere, Tony."
"And just for that," Tony huffs, "we're going to have our first date at your bar. I expect it to be on the house."
to clutch at the last bits of their friendship, but even in anger and hurt, he knew he’d regret it if he walked away.
compromise his already shaky resolve, buzzing alcohol tempting him to do stupid things like kissing Steve's ridiculously high cheekbones.
He wants that so much, but he's trying to turn over a new leaf. No parties, more boring responsibilities.
“We're in Mount Sinai,” Natasha says, “you've been here three days, and Sam will be checking up on you in twenty minutes.”
Calculating trajectory and speed and force comes easily now to Steve. He wonders dimly as he picks the shield up whether it was this thrilling in Tony's mind too, being able to count the world so precisely and bend it to his needs.
"You don't have to answer," Tony quickly says, shifting the smallest bit closer. "I shouldn't have asked."
MARIA is his Mostly Accurate Remote Intelligence Assistant, a name which the Marketing guys hated but sent the Board of Directors into tittering laughter as Tony winks at Obie and tips back another glass of champagne.
The eagle doll, once shrunk, ends up in the workshop's couch for Steve to hug when Tony is busy working. Much to Tony's chagrin, he names her Martha after George Washington's wife, instead of Tony's suggested '
"Satellite targetting really is the future, isn't it, William?" she hooks her arm with Tony's, "my son's made so many great leaps and he's only twenty five. Makes me exceedingly proud of him."
When Tony kisses Steve, his smile is wide and unrestrained. Free and whole and threatening to swallow Steve in its sweetness.
Steve finally meets his eyes with something other than anger etched on his face. "I would trust Tony with my life, ma'am."
. Were they really going out to the airport for a Christmas getaway? Was the road really empty? Did Howard really drink that much before - before the accident?"
hands. There are splotches of red where the skin seems burnt from more than just a sun - had Tony been too near a fire?
Tony’s startled expression shows that he’s probably thinking the same thing. His mouth falls open then closing again. “You’re upset… because I went cake-tasting with Clint?” Tony asks slowly, his tone clearly screaming
Tony says these last words in the same tone that someone else might say, “possessed by a Skrull,” complete with a look of utter horror. Pepper hides her laugh behind one hand and shares an amused look with Natasha, who is currently sitting on Tony’s other side and digging her toes into his thigh.
“Sam called Carol on me. She is to enforce that I get enough sleep,” Stark pops a potato wedge into his mouth. “But Clint told me a certain Captain was darkening his door, and I told her I'd sleep after a quick stop.”
Better that they never realise the full extent of JARVIS, so he makes a limited AI to install in all the company's tech, monitoring all data inputs and the flow of the production line.
He wishes he could see them one last time, and yet, hearing their voices was already a gift. Only, he wishes the last words he gets from Steve weren’t orders telling him to take cover, wishes it had been anything other than fear in Steve’s voice. Wishes he got to see Steve smile one last time.
Steve helps crank the bed up, letting Tony sit properly. "And that's scientifically proven, Doctor?"
There was something about that which settled uncomfortably close to his heart. Gulping down the tea to wash off the ashy taste on his tongue, he shifts in his couch.
It’s another week before Tony feels spry enough to talk in proper sentences, and another week before Tony starts to crawl out of his skin, needing to get out of the Tower’s med wing.
"New companies are emerging to compete with in tech," the man stands. "Does this mean you'll be joining them in the race for computing power?"
Steve huffs, torn between being touched and being confused at the sudden surge of concern from Tony.
He storms out of the kitchen, the words ringing in his head, and he has to sit, heaving in heavy breaths inside his car before he feels steady enough to drive. JARVIS' speaker on the phone blasts out rock songs to drown out the loop of Christmas songs jingling in his head.
scarf around Steve's neck to pull him close, and in the vibrant marketplace, Tony winks at him, heedless of the stares pointed at them.
“More like my breakfasts,” Stark mutters to himself. "Why haven't I seen you around the bar before?"
to know. The deadline to everything – his mind already ticking, searching for ways to fix, to solve.
drink. You say you're trying to move to clean energy but you keep building weapons. You tell me to come home safe, but when I get home I can't seem to find you."
"More than fifty," he twists around to avoid being spotted by a director's wife. "Also, alcohol is wasted on you so lemme have the fun."
It's been enough with everyone else: with Carol, with Thor, with Natasha and Clint. Help them get better, spend a few nights out at the bar with them before slinking back to his penthouse or his labs where he builds new hearts for people who need them more than him.
He knows that as a founder of SHIELD, Howard Stark is technically his boss. But he's also fairly certain that should Agent Carter get wind of what was happening to her godson, she would be on Steve's side.
Doctor Erskine had only been the first in a long list of innocents tied up in a violent war nobody was going to win.
Tony pushes himself out of her hold to press next on the radio, changing the song into a less happy tune and ramping up the volume even more. The cheerfulness of Christmas songs in the middle of summer was far too much on his sanity.
And if Steve thinks Tony is brave, doesn't Tony owe it to him to take the last step after all the steps Steve has leaped through for him? He has fuzzy memories of Steve carrying him out of the burning hospital, and he remembers the gentleness of Steve's hold.
“Yes, if you’ll come along, I’ll show you to his office,” Miss Potts smiles back, clipboard in hand and leading them down the hallway to where the vets do their consultations. The VA and Sam had assured Steve that no matter what the reputation around the Stark family name was, Stark Paws Clinic is
Day forty is when things start to crumble. Stane is tired of waiting, and the government is tired of expending resources in a strict war zone.
Before the award show at Caesars Palace, then. "JARVIS," Steve taps on one of the holograms, watching it expand to become a prosthetic arm, the exact kind Bucky has. "I need logs of all of Stane's contacts in the past year, and I need all of Tony's records on me."
"I hated you, you know? Tony would have given you the world if you asked for it, the stars if you wanted it," Rhodey quietly confesses, the fierce anger receeding into cold fact. "And you walked away from him."
When Steve enters the kitchen, he finds Tony and a red-haired lady sitting across him from the table. At the center of it, a deformed apple pie, clearly having been stabbed by a fork one too many times.
"College was hard, Ty and Sunset are bitter that we're doing better than their family companies, Howard thinks you're God's most righteous man," Tony lets out a small sigh, "and it turns out I need to fix the postal service."
Steve is in the arts program, Tony in the science program. That means, most days, they don’t cross paths unless they intend to. The one possible room for them to meet unintentionally is the art studio, where the school’s grand piano is located alongside various easels for painting, where all students can spend their spare time practicing the boring arts of high society.
"Ah," Stane says, "I'm sure the good Captain has a vested interest in keeping Tony safe, but we're handling this strictly in-house."
"I've found no incriminating evidence about Tony," Steve reports almost defensively. Then, with the full weight of reality, he adds, "but if you've found anything hinting at his... his guilt, I would - I would be able to act."
Surprisingly enough, Stark shakes his head. "Not for a few more minutes. Hammer's lab is a big fat fire hazard. I'm not going to go
"Carrie, hi." He smiles, dismissing Steve's angry glare. "You're doing a great job and I need you to keep your hand right where it is."
"But this - this HYDRA is growing impatient," Tony fills in the blanks, rolling his eyes when the song loops back once again.
“Not at all, Doctor!” Kamala pokes her head out of the storage room in the far corner. “Just helping Clint replace the dart board, then back to earning cash for my med school.”
A gentle thud behind Steve signals the door shutting close, the chopper ready for takeoff. "I'm also pissed at you for making me worry," Steve smiles back at him, "we'll talk when we get you checked up."
The thing is that Steve might have been able to dismiss it as another modern joke, to bear his confusion and growing
Collecting the medkit he dropped, Tony checks on some bottles before fishing out a piece of cloth to wipe the slobber off his face. “Didn’t expect such a friendly reception.”
“I don't have to,” Steve agrees, but he offers up both his hands for Tony to take. “I'm sorry. Missed you last night.”
"I should make a flying car, shouldn't I?" Tony leans across the workshop table to steal some of Steve's soda.
Later, Rhodey would call Tony a traitor for dragging him into a minefield of awkward conversations, but Tony maintains that as the official military liaison to Stark Industries, Rhodey had orders to protect him.
"Three minutes out from the explosion site!" Sam shouts over whirring of the chopper's blades, just loud enough for Steve's enhanced hearing to pick up. Steve gives him a nod, strapping on the last of his gear. Their radars had spotted a large explosion this morning in the vicinity of the location Steve found, and they won't risk anything.
“I'm sure,” Steve promises. Then, to placate her, he adds, “come by the station more often, Miss Khan. You can watch the EMTs train.”
"Risk can be minimalised," Tony drums his fingers on the side of the mug, jittery and half-afraid. He knows about choice and the futility of it. "Danger can be controlled for. Nobody chooses to
The only one worth meeting from school was a certain Steve Rogers, and as much of a masochist as Tony can sometimes be, he already sees Steve often enough each week to fulfil his pain quota.
He stands aside as Sunset’s lips twist into a sneer. When she speaks, her tone is all prim and proper despite her words – their upbringing demands decorum, especially in hostility, and Sunset is nothing if not her parents’ perfect daughter.
Tony pokes at Steve's arms, pulling at them until his fingers close around Steve's wrist, smile smug. “You want to join my harem.”
Steve thinks of the doctors who had saved him when he had been a skinny, sickly young boy. Miracle workers.
“Nothing ever is. But it’s the truth. We were children and you were there when I had no one else,” Steve puts down the picture frame, opening the drawer to toss his items on the bed - a notebook, dog tags, an old burner phone. "You want me to leave? I'll leave. You want me to come back? It better be because you need me. Not because you want to lie to me again."
Steve rolls his eyes, but his smile stays on, long after they take the car back to the mansion, and even after he finds his rest in Tony's perfectly large bed.
If word got out that he had created an intelligence as advanced as JARVIS, he doesn't know what something like J could do in the hands of the wrong person.
, which Jarvis says is honestly true. Except, Jarvis calls Tony that fondly, and Steve would most likely mean it in the rudest sense of the word.
Rhodey takes a loud sip of his milkshake that somehow manages to sound sarcastic. "I'm just saying, you don't have the best history with 'friends'," he makes air quotes in Tony's face, "from your beloved boarding school."
“Men like us don’t get privacy, Tony," Obie walks closer. "Men like us don't get to have foolish dreams like Ty Stone. And it would be so easy for me to find secrets against your boyfriend. Did you know his father was an alcoholic?”
Steve's only consolation is that Stane didn't win. Not a single dollar of Tony's belongings fell to Stane's hands, and Pepper's new control of the company's ownership let her freeze the new weapons production.
“Of course.” Foggy turns around and presses a lightning quick kiss to Matt’s palm. “Give us a minute, Matty?” Steve swears he sees the tips of Matt’s ears turn pink as he nods quickly.
“I thought I was going to lose you,” he continues, and the admission is hot and bitter against the roof of his mouth.
“And you… you love me.” Tony tests the words out carefully, still looking more than a little hesitant. Steve can’t help but beam up at Tony, and he pulls Tony forward with both hands.
When he looks back down, Jan is peering at him with a soft expression. Steve feels a rush of warmth at the thought of being lucky enough to have friends who know him well and care about him to the point of following him out onto a fire escape in the middle of a party, just to make sure he’s alright.
“Something wrong, Cap?” Nat asks, shifting in her seat as she makes a grab for the popcorn bowl in Thor’s hands.
Maybe seeing Tony and Natasha being intimate and affectionate while playing a couple has rattled him more than expected, but that’s only because it’s so unlike them. Steve hasn’t seen Tony smile at anyone like that since he and Pepper broke up, and that was a long time ago, back during the Avengers’ first trial run and before they had reformed as a better and stronger team. He wonders if that means there hasn’t been anybody special in Tony’s life since then, as he hasn’t introduced anyone new to the team.
“Steve Rogers?” Steve looks up at the sound of his name to see someone he guesses is Foggy grinning down at him, one hand outstretched. The expression in his blue eyes is warm and open; the small bubble of anxiety in Steve’s stomach settles and dissipates at his friendly, quiet smile.
“I didn’t.” Steve moans softly as Tony’s lips start drifting down his chest, leaving a trail of firm kisses. “But I still think we should let Clint walk in on us,” he adds.
Tony’s pretty sure his heart is never going to stop going a mile a minute at this rate, and it’s entirely Steve’s fault.
The New Year’s bash they decided to have only a few days ago is now in full swing, team members and friends and acquaintances alike all chatting amongst themselves in different groups to the beat of the music, which Tony suspects Nat put Clint in charge of. He’s always had a very eclectic taste. Tony spots many familiar faces in the crowd, and the sight of Carol and Rhodey standing close together, soft smiles on their faces, leaves him feeling happy and warm. Even if he fails in his wish for tonight, things are clearly looking good for the pair of them. It’ll be something to celebrate, along with the new year.
Then there’s the time Tony’s armor is drenched with frog slime in the middle of a battle (villains are really straining for creativity, lately) and Tony has to take off the armor immediately at the end of the battle to avoid contamination.
“First of all, thank you for trusting me with this, Steve,” Foggy says, and Steve manages a weak smile.
“So, you want to go grab a bite? There’s this new exhibit on dinosaurs at the Museum of Natural History I’ve been meaning to check out, and I thought you might like to come along as well. I think you’d have fun.”
“I mean,” Tony says, grinding the words out between his teeth, “that this isn’t on you, okay? It’s all me.” He runs a hand through his hair until it’s sticking up at the sides.
“We’re not,” Tony breathes, staring up at Steve, and it’s only then that Steve realizes his finger is still on Tony’s lips. He blushes and opens his mouth to apologize, only to find Tony’s own fingers circling his own wrist, moving Steve’s finger just a little until it lingers on the edge of Tony’s bottom lip.
“Oh.” The disappointment on Tony’s face at Steve’s response stings, and a small part of him wonders if there’s something more than disappointment there, but Steve pushes it away. There’s no need for him to dwell on more false hopes.
“A little. Just one of those days, I guess,” Steve replies, trying to subtly edge his sketchpad out of Tony’s line of sight with one hand. It would be a disaster if his drawings gave away his feelings, and Steve figures that would be a sure bet. “You just get back from SI?” he continues, hoping to distract Tony with a change of subject.
“Only because Loki spiked the punch,” Tony retorts, turning and swinging an arm around her shoulders.
One more step and their faces are suddenly so close, Tony can count each of Steve’s brown, gold-flecked eyelashes if he wanted to. He takes a deep breath and stands on his tiptoes,  moving past the luscious temptation of Steve’s very pink lips to whisper into his ear. His own mouth grazes Steve’s earlobe as he begins to speak, and Tony swears he hears Steve’s breath hitch a little in his throat.
Tony lifts his gaze to Steve’s face, feeling more than a little dazed. Steve is blushing deeply, dark red blotching his cheeks, and Tony aches with how much he wants him. He’s sure he must look a sight as well. All they’ve done so far is kiss, and yet Tony feels like he’s more than halfway to being ravished right now.
“Oh.” Steve leans back on his heels, trying to ignore his immediate disappointment. It’s no big deal. He’ll just look for Tony after getting some rest. He definitely needs a nap, anyway.
He spends the day curled up under a pile of blankets and watching romcoms, failing to distract himself from thinking about Tony.
He rubs a hand over the back of his neck, ducking his head a little to hide a grin. Jane Foster, SI’s new intern, reaches over from her spot next to Thor to give Tony a high five, clearly in agreement with him.
“I know how I feel and I know that there’s nothing wrong with me just because romance might work differently for me than it does for most other people.” Steve releases a slightly watery sigh. “I know it now, and I’m happy.”
“You do?” Tony’s question is soft and careful, and Steve understands the cautious note in his voice even as it sends a rush of protectiveness surging through his veins.
Then, Tony sees the gold letters spelling “Stark” on the edge of Steve’s hood and his mind grinds to a halt.
“Are you saying that was the first time you’ve ever checked me out? I’m a little disappointed, Tony.”
Once again, Tony voices their goodbyes and then they make their way quickly towards the open door. Once they’re half a block from the bar, Tony breaks his silence to thank Steve for the rescue from an overly ardent admirer, a mixture of relief and discomfort in his voice.
“What’s with the frown, Cap? Still grumpy because I suggested some modern improvements for your shield?”
He clears his throat hurriedly and sucks in a deep breath before ducking his head down to look at the floor. The short reprieve gives Tony a few precious seconds to jumpstart his lust-addled brain into thinking semi-coherently, and when he looks back up at Steve, he’s relatively certain that he has just enough willpower not to jump Steve right there and then on one of the rec room’s extremely comfortable couches.
glasses. Steve’s eyes are so very blue, and so very beautiful. Tony would like nothing more than to drown in them.
Steve’s face brightens at this, a soft, happy grin stretching across his face that Tony sees far too little of, one that always makes him feel like Steve is giving him something precious, something just for the two of them. “You think so?” he asks.
"What secrets did you get him to spill?" Tony feels antsy again. He barely had time to process the fact that Steve is insanely attractive -
“The little boy who was quiet and scared but who offered to be brave for another scared boy? That’s who I fell in love with,” Steve tells him. “The kind, brilliant young man who believed he could change the world, who believed everyone else could too?” he lets out a bitter laugh. “That’s who I stayed in love with.”
“I've had breakfast,” Steve turns the food down. With his stomach twisted into knots, he doesn't know if he can even swallow anything.
He wonders how differently he would have turned out if he had grown up with a father like Howard, and it strikes him again how cruel it had been for him to leave Tony alone.
“Hey, Miss Khan,” Stark gently puts his hand on her shoulder, steering her into the hospital. “I thought we agreed: if you want to visit me at work, you don't enter through the ER doors.”
Maybe Steve should’ve called Bucky instead. Or not. Bucky would only tease without giving any insight. Steve sighs. He doesn’t know whether he should feel guilty that he’s concerned over what to wear when Liberty’s just been attacked. But Liberty is doing much better than she had been five hours ago, and he’s not sure how quickly he can get the apartment cleaned before Tony comes over.
With anyone else, the bitter anger might have worked. But Steve remains infuriatingly stubborn. His nostrils flare, and he asks Tony, "did Obadiah put you up to this?"
Munching on the fries, Tony shrugs. “If I smiled the whole day long, some would accuse me of psychopathy.”
heroes.” He gives another wry smile to Kamala, and Steve stares at the dimples forming in his cheeks, at the way the bright white lights turn Stark’s eyes into a gentle brown, calming and steady. “Ah, took you long enough, Sam.”
Signalling to Sam, Steve calls him over to help carry Tony the last few feet into the waiting medevac chopper.
Tony fiddles with the red shirt left on the bed. "I don't have the best record for self-preservation."
Steve honestly doesn’t know if Stark is greeting him or Liberty. “Hi,” Steve clears his throat. “I’m Steve.”
The press of Tony’s lips against his hairline is a sweet and welcome familiarity, one that Steve will never get enough of. Tony hums against Steve’s skin, his lips brushing Steve’s forehead with every tiny movement. Steve feels the vibration of it echoing through his body, down to the soles of his feet, steadying him.
When they break apart for air, Tony’s smile is a small, impossibly beautiful thing. The smile of a man in love.
“Can I crash here for a bit?” Tony asks, raising one hand up to hide an enormous yawn. “Bruce is still not done with lab work and I locked myself out of our room again.”
He wishes he could be with Tony at the gala right now, so that he could chase away the sadness in Tony’s face with an inside joke and a teasing smile, and he could take Tony in his arms and hold him close, could lean in and—
“Growing up, I knew a lot of people who really wanted to have their first kiss just to say they had done it, or for the experience of it. But I never wanted it that way. I didn’t mind waiting, and there wasn’t really anyone who I wanted to kiss anyway.”
There’s a short pause before he continues again, still unable to meet Tony’s eyes. “So that’s why it’s been difficult for me, being around you. And you didn’t make me uncomfortable during truth and dare. It was just hard, hearing that you used to have a crush on Captain America when I feel the way I do about you. I’m working on it though, and I hate that it’s affected our friendship like this, but I don’t want to lose you either. I can’t promise that I’ll get over it soon, but—”
Steve nods. “Definitely, we’re doing this again. Why don’t you come over next week once you’ve decided on the colors and I’ll give you my thoughts? We’ll rewatch Dead Poets Society so you’ll understand exactly why you’re wrong about it being a bad movie.”
this undercover operation was a bad idea. He just didn’t think it’d be because he’d be sucker-punched with the fact that he’s head over heels in love with Tony. Who is his best friend, and who definitely doesn’t return his feelings.
“I’m fine, Hawkeye. Let’s just focus on the mission,” Steve says, clearing his throat. He doesn’t bother sparing a glance in Clint’s direction, keeping his eyes focused on the video feed playing out in front of them. The video feed of the gala that Tony and Nat are attending tonight as a couple, playing the role to retrieve important intel.
Steve’s hands are still braced on Tony’s hips, and a small part of him thrills at the intimacy of it. It was only after they had taken this new step in their relationship that Steve had realized just exactly why he’d felt Tony’s absence so keenly when the team had disbanded. Even after months of having Tony in his arms, in his bed, getting to have him like this feels new.
Steve smiles as he feels Tony stir beside him. He leans over to brush Tony’s hair out of his eyes before kissing him gently on the forehead.
He swallows the word before it can materialize in the crisp, cold air between them. The serum keeps him warm, but all he feels is ice in his bones. The truth stains the inside of his mouth like a bite of rotten fruit, sour and sharp.
Tony growls and buries his face in his hands. He’s at the very end of his rope. There’s only the tiniest sliver of pride holding his self-control back from marching into Steve’s room, swooning into his arms, and telling Steve to have his way with Tony.
Steve pulls Tony further into his arms, leaning down to whisper in his ear. “I mean, you're my jacket thief. And I caught you.”
Foggy releases the pose when Steve grins, breaking into a laugh of his own. “Seriously though, it’s been a blast.”
“Yeah, Nat got it for me. She said it’s the trendy thing to wear these days.” Steve meets Tony’s gaze head-on, eyes wide with what some might read as innocence but Tony knows to be anything but. One thing they had left out of the history books was Steve’s talent for sass.
“Morning, sleepyhead.” Steve’s grin turns into a laugh when Tony makes a sound like a disgruntled cat in response.
In the end, he had said nothing. Steve’s not sure if he feels more relieved or disappointed about that.
Steve pauses, releasing a long sigh that turns wobbly at the end. He registers the shaky timbre of his voice, the weight of something tight in his throat making it hard for him to swallow and start again.
Tony watches Steve’s pupils dilate as he steps closer to Tony almost instinctively. One hand reaches out and hovers carefully over the lapel of Tony’s suit jacket, as if Steve wants to grab on and pull Tony close.
"Foggy helped me realize that I’m demiromantic. It means that for me, friendship and romantic attraction go hand in hand. After that I could finally see how I feel about you clearly.”
Steve watches Tony covertly in the glow of the firelight, eyes tracing over Tony’s animated movements as he trades jokes with Jim on the opposite side of the camp. His eager gestures are easy to memorize. If only they were just as easily captured on the page.
