Making sure Sherlock wouldn't fall off the sofa and hurt himself further. John hurried into the kitchen to see what their options were. The first thing he spotted was the half-finished bottle of scotch sitting on the table. He reached for it but stopped with his fingers around the neck of the bottle.
Greg turns on the spot and zips out of there quickly, leaving John to witness what Sherlock looks like when completely cornered.
They showered together, and by some miracle, John managed to keep his hands to himself. However, he did
“Exactly. Wait — you are?” John’s head snapped around to face him, a mixture of panic and curiosity in his eyes.
Sherlock’s out then. John checks his phone, but the only message is from Greg, asking if they were okay after their outburst the previous afternoon. He sends a quick reply, purposefully not telling him how that particular argument ended. John isn’t sure where they stand now. Was that it? One more night of...whatever
There’s a pause, a moment of silence as the pair acknowledge each other, before John’s mouth runs away with itself.
The taxi ride back to St Barts is quiet, and John finds his thoughts floating back to Sherlock. It’s been over 24 hours since Sherlock’s last text, and John wonders if that should bother him or not. Perhaps Sherlock is biding his time, or more likely, he’s already begun the process of deleting John’s existence from his mind palace, one section at a time. John’s stomach twists at the idea of being wiped like a virus in an otherwise functional hard drive.
He winked once at Sherlock and gave his knee a squeeze before getting up to fetch his medical kit. By the time he'd returned to Sherlock, the other two men had left. John could hear the outside door slam shut. He gave the flat one look, drank in the shattered glass and shards of wood, and honestly couldn't blame them.
“How have things been?” she asked as John settled down in the seat right across from her. His smile faltered a bit by the question. As if he was rearranging the answer to something softer to spare her from the sharpness of the truth, and Molly hated that so many people did that. Assumed that she needed to be handled with care.
The Uber driver gives a cheery wave goodbye that John is too annoyed to reciprocate. Instead, his eyes stare at the sharp decline in his bank balance on his mobile as he stands on the pavement outside Harry’s flat.
It wasn’t until they fell into a cab that Sherlock let himself breathe. They’d done it. The yard had been called, Michael Pierce was in custody, and Sherlock had solved one of the longest running serial murders he’d ever seen. Or at least, the longest one he’d been directly involved with.
Apparently, it took Sherlock his entire sexually active adulthood to find someone who knew the only way to turn on his being told what to do kink to eleven. The commanding voice was enough to roll his eyes back, but the growl in the tone was the tipping point to get Sherlock to grab John's hips hard and pull him closer to the edge of the bed. A few slides of lubricant around his shaft, and Sherlock pressed inside of John's tight rings of muscle with a firm thrust.
John gets the omega - Sherlock - back to his flat and begins emergency care. Can he beat his biological clock and tend to his patient before the Alpha inside of him takes full control?
“Sorry to spring this on you and Sherlock so last minute,” Greg mutters. His salt and pepper hair flutters in the chilly morning wind.
“Last night shouldn’t have happened,” John says, trying his best to keep as calm as possible. “I was drunk and...I’m sorry if you assumed that there would be more.”
“Oh, you’ll figure it out eventually. It just takes a while.” Irene replies, as if she can read his every thought. Sherlock’s body gives another mighty shiver. “Here, take my coat. Or rather, I do believe this is yours.” The Woman begins to undress, pulling off the large coat she’s been bundled up in. Sherlock now realises it is indeed his Belstaff, and he immediately pulls it on. It sticks slightly against his skin, as if he’s damp after a shower, but the warmth it provides is heavenly.
John balled up his fingers into fists and for a fleeting second Sally thought that he was about to explode. She took one step back just in case.
“I thought it was simple. All my life I have not experienced attraction of any sort, and yet John Watson is driving me to distraction. I was clearly wrong in my initial assessment, but I do not understand how. I still do not want anything of a sexual nature, and yet…”
Sherlock rolled over to face John. It was evident that both of them would need to be in the shower for a while to get cleaned up, but it was very well worth it.
The first few days had brought a flurry of Sherlock’s mystifying words, followed by eery quiet. Lestrade had occasionally rung John and assured him that Sherlock was still functioning as well as could be expected, although it was clear that he was smoking again. He wasn’t even trying to hide it anymore.
More scribbling. Much more scribbling than necessary for the small amount of information that John had given out so far.
“So it seems. I had begun to realise that, by the end. Although, my reasoning was a little off. It’s irrelevant now.” She shrugged, as if to cement the point. “I still do not see the problem.”
“Perhaps. But what are you going to do about it? You’re in no position to threaten me. One slip—” He pushed the knife a little harder, “—and you can’t walk out of here.”
. Sherlock knew at this point tears were on his cheeks and ending up in his mouth. The salty flavour was everywhere, but all he could do was groan in the afterglow, and when he thought it was over, he came again.
“This is just gravel from the driveway. There’s nothing here, Lestrade. Nothing we haven’t already found.”
Sherlock hesitated, and Irene jumped on the concession like a dog with a bone. He’d forgotten how stubborn she could be -- identifying a sore spot and clamping onto it with all her might. There would be no arguing with her. John had tried that and failed. Besides, she wasn’t far from the truth. Even if John wasn’t his, wasn’t he effectively asking her for a way to fix that? To find a way to keep his scent, keep everything about him, available whenever he wanted? To understand what the hell his body was doing to him?
“Good,” John murmurs and leans in to kiss me, taxi-driver be damned. “Now, let’s go home so we can get all of these clothes off for the rest of the night.”
Shakily, Sherlock checked his missed calls: six from John’s phone, two from Lestrade, and one from Mrs Hudson’s landline. There was a single text from John, a three-digit number that Sherlock presumed was his room number. Nothing else.
“Put the bill on Mycroft Holmes’ account,” Sherlock said to the server, his meal fully finished as he scrolled through an article about the death of Hank Pillet. His death had been a much nastier affair, and evidently, the crime scene had been heavily contaminated and had gone very cold. Even with the small amount of data that the news article goes over, it’s clear to Sherlock that Pillet’s death was much more involved than it appeared.
Sherlock rolled both choices in his head and didn’t like how either sounded. Even more reason to get his data properly strategised so that John wanted to spend more time with him again.
Sherlock moaned at the next slide up and down of John and his erections and wrapped his legs around John’s waist. The chill of the metal table was wonderful, along with the heat they were creating in between them. The slight creak of the table legs as their movements started a healthy rhythm added to the sounds coming out of both of their mouths.
Sherlock tilts his head, and John’s heart does a similar movement in the centre of his chest. It’s unsettling and painful, but he stays as upright as he can. Ever the soldier, even now.
"Christ on a cracker," John muttered as he handed the drink over, "Are both of you just dying for a good shag? Is all this hatred foreplay for your brother? Now expensive gifts? What's next? Is he going to buy me a house… or worse, a yacht?"
No. Not ok. This has all the hallmarks of not being ok at all. Falling backwards instead of forwards is all I can hope for at this point.
It was unnerving, the unspoken longing. He’d never felt it before, and it bothered him that he couldn’t quite identify it. His brain ran in circles, analysing it to death, trying to understand what was different this time. What was different about John?
“Good morning…” she paused before checking the clipboard in her hand. “Dr. Watson,” she continued. “Seems that we have a few questions about the items in your duffel bag.”
“Jesus Christ, mate....you took at least ten years off our lives with that stunt,” Lestrade’s voice floats in the background, keeping his distance.
The rainbow flag that Sherlock bought billows behind them and reminds John of the way Sherlock’s Belstaff coat does the same thing. Sherlock has no real right to look so stunning in whatever he wears, but John can’t help but grin.
Greg narrows his eyes, and John watches him check to assure that Sherlock is still out of easy hearing range.
him his thanks. But a small portion of his brain reminded him they were sort of in the middle of a serious conversation.
“Need the lube,” John groans, fangs distended and eyes savagely dark. “If you don’t fuck me right now...I’ll bite your fucking head off your neck…”
Its scent was strange in that tingley type of way that reminded Sherlock of honey bee’s dancing across his skin during the summer of his childhood. Back then, his parents cared for hives in their place in Kent, and Sherlock would help his Father gather up the honey after relaxing the bees with smoke and calming words. Every once in a while, a few of the insects would settle onto the small patches of Sherlock’s skin that the protective suit didn’t quite cover, and Sherlock enjoyed the tiny tickles of their feet as they rested.
"What I like changes from day to day, but as far as what I don't like, that's very simple. Men who don't appreciate who they have in their bed until it's too late. I highly doubt you'll disappoint me."
Irene continued to watch his every move and listened for any inflexion that indicated weakness and vulnerability. Sherlock forced himself to appear as neutral as possible, but there were cracks in the veneer. Tiny pinpoints that Irene would be able to tap on with her delicately polished fingernails until Sherlock was truly broken open.
She stepped into the room and felt a sudden chill. As if the iridescent eyes of Sherlock were watching every single one of her footfalls. A condemnatory specter casting deductions about her reasons for being in John’s world. Just a placeholder in a flimsy cotton nightgown and a barrage of dyed blonde waves that didn’t deserve John and never would.
“Yeah, sorry. I, uh, just realised that I lost my job too. When I left Sherlock — sorry, I shouldn’t be saying all of this on a date with someone else.”
as her mother would say, and then laugh at the double meaning. And then say it again. The second time was always a little quieter.
“You don’t have to say anything back,” John continues. “Just thought that you deserved to know where I stood in all of this, yeah?”
“Jesus,” John pinches the bridge of his nose in exasperation.. “Relationships aren’t just sex, you know.”
There were good days and bad days, and Martha Hudson knew how to care for both types. It came from being there when her boys would row and laugh in succession. Sherlock’s quicker movements along the floor upstairs a pulse point, and John’s slower footsteps there to make the taller man pause. She imagined their quieter nights filled with evenings of television and bowls of over buttered popcorn. Their hands pointedly never touching, but close enough to feel the warm and solid presence of the other.
“You’re running out of time to figure this out,” Irene whispers. Her eyes are a softened version of what they were only moments ago, and
She wastes no time pouring them a glass of wine and settling onto the sofa. Each sentence becomes more flirtatious than the last, and John realises she wants him to make the first move. Never one to disappoint, he reaches forward, delicately placing a hand on her cheek, allowing his eyes to flicker down to her lips before closing the gap. She is soft beneath him, her mouth much smaller than he’s used to. It takes him a moment to adjust, but before long, she’s moaning against his mouth, her tongue pressing against his. A hand works its way up his neck, and for a split second, he is reminded of his last night with Sherlock; one calloused hand running through his hair, another traveling south…
“I don’t want to lose him, Greg. I know it’s stupid. He’s insufferable, and selfish, and so many other enraging adjectives, but God, I adore all of it. We just — we don’t work as romantic partners anymore. But I’m not ready to lose him yet. Not completely.”
If anything John’s expression became even tenser. His eyes darted from Sherlock to what was, more than likely, the quickest exit out of the restaurant.
An embarrassingly loud moan slipped from Sherlock’s mouth, and he tried and failed to suppress the shiver of need that ran through him. John smirked into his ear, running his hand further up his thigh, pausing just shy of his crotch. Sherlock whimpered, begging John to close the distance, but his hand stayed there, teasing.
John takes a deep breath as Sherlock waits for an answer. The conversation he’d had with Mycroft has been on a loop in his head for the majority of his day, and yet now, all he wants to do is pretend none of it happened. Like it was an odd fever dream brought on by too many long hours between the surgery and this exhausting reopened case.
Sherlock is somewhat aware of this as John is squeaking quite a lot as he wiggles in Sherlock’s long fingers. Tiny wings flapping madly as he tries to break free of a Sherlock Holmes who has decided that hugging John in bat form is his new favorite activity.
He slowly peels off his clothes and crawls into bed, the blanket of alcohol heavy on his brain. He tries to close his eyes and sleep, but each time he does, they spring open again, and he is left feeling more awake than before. In the end, he settles for memorising the cracks in the ceiling, willing exhaustion to rear its head. He’s usually a master at getting to sleep, no matter the time or place. It was a residual habit from the army, one that came in useful when Sherlock insisted on staying awake for days,  himself up in the lab at Barts. John would often fall asleep on the chairs, and Molly had joked that they should build a bed in there. Even on stakeouts, John would nap on Sherlock’s shoulder, taking the opportunity to rest where he could, knowing that the next chance could be hours away.
The chastising is fair, and that’s part of why John hates it so much. He should be doing what Ella had advised all those sessions ago; turn to his friends when bad things happen, and not keep his pain bottled up until it cracks under the pressure.
Sherlock trails off, his voice nothing but a croak of its former self. John is gaping at him as he witnesses Sherlock reaching into his back pocket and pulling out what is plainly his own ring box.
They pause as a couple of cars go by, then cross at the pedestrian crossing. Their steady pace will have them at the next club within about five minutes if they keep up their stride.
Unsure where to look first, John's eyes slid like water over his groin and legs, then back up to Sherlock's cock. A smile toyed at his lips, seeing the beads of precome glistening on the rosy tip. Sherlock was enjoying this just as much as he was.
” Here, in my bedroom, I can hear John’s voice more clearly. His sentences are whispers in my ear, instructing me how to touch myself; where to squeeze, where to pull, and all the while he’d be pushing inside of me, filling every crevice. He’d lick the sweat from my neck, right from my collar all the way to my ear, and my mind would dissociate as we came together; thick sticky white exploding on our bellies. However, when I open my eyes, I am alone, covered in the remnants of my fantasy.
Now Martha lived in a waiting room. Her ears and heart both opened the occasional days when John would make up an excuse to sit across from her kitchen table. Patiently waiting for the niceties to subside so that Sherlock’s name finally broke the surface of silence, and they both could breathe once more.
“You arsehole.” He chokes out, but there’s no malice behind it. It’s not Sherlock he’s mad at, and Sherlock's deep rumbling chuckle vibrates at the base of John's throat as he is kissed there over and over again. Familiar hands undo his belt and zipper with a grace that John will never possess, but adores more than he can explain. "Enough talk. Take me to bed."
John circles the outside of Sherlock’s hole with his index finger, tenderly massaging the muscle, heat surging to his groin as Sherlock tries to lean into the pressure. John squeezes a generous amount of lube onto his fingers, gently sliding a finger inside. The muscles tense sharply and Sherlock moans, but he quickly relaxes, and John pushes forward, pressing firmly against the inner wall.
“Hey,” Molly said as he pushed open the laboratory door. She was wearing lipstick again, and cradling the same coffee mug from the previous time he had been here.
Mycroft’s words, hammered into him for as long as he can remember, echo around his head on an almost daily basis. He had tried to stay true to them, convincing himself that he was fine alone, that he didn’t need anyone. Perhaps that was all a lie.
” A playful smile hung on Lestrade’s lips, and John looked as if he wanted the earth to open up and swallow him whole. Sherlock ignored him — John was embarrassed by the most trivial things, who cared if they were having sex? It was just another biological function, there was nothing embarrassing about it.
“I know Sherlock, I didn’t think you’d be able to stay forever” he smiled, a soft devastating smile “Just promise me one more thing, just one more thing--“
“Sherlock, today with Ella, she wanted me to say some things, some things that I’ve wanted to say to you for a while and I never have, I never got round to it, I didn’t know how. I didn’t know how you’d react. God, I didn’t want to ruin our friendship, so I never said anything. And now it’s too late, I left it too late but I have to say it now. Sherlock I--” he faltered, breathing deeply, his eyes wet with emotion. My heart was in my throat. No! Not now, not like this!
And with that the memories came flooding back; standing on the roof, the wind tugging at my coat, on the phone to John, needing him to listen to me, the sound of the phone hitting the asphalt and then I’d jumped, hearing my name wrenched from John’s throat as the ground rushed up to meet me. Oh my God, Oh my God! John, where was John? I tore my eyes away from the bloodied body for a moment, my eyes flicking across seeking out John’s familiar face. And there he was, rushing forward, frantic. He pushed himself through the crowd, trying to get closer to me, desperate.
“Grow up, Sherlock. You know, we’re doing you a favour letting you come down and give a hand but you have to do the paperwork--
The atmosphere inside the café was quiet but fraught with nervous energy that seemed to roil off of every surface and there was broken glass that crunched underfoot as Sherlock stepped carefully inside. His focus was entirely drawn by the man who was cowering against the barister counter, his knees drawn up tight to his chest, his face pressed against them. His hands were clasped behind his head, gripping the gun tightly. His short dusky blond hair stuck up around his fingers. Sherlock could see that he was shaking. He was breathing heavily, his breaths harsh in the forced silence around them. He could see the tan lines about the man’s wrists, visible just above the cuff of his shirt. So, not home long then, hasn’t yet had a chance to adapt. He looked incredibly fragile, as if at any moment he could shatter, his pieces joining the shards of glass littering the floor. Sherlock himself was uncomfortably intimate with the feelings of desperation, of guilt, despair that were shrouding the man in front of him. It stirred feelings of tenderness, a wave of empathy closing over him taking him by surprise. A noise towards the back of the room broke his focus and his head snapped up, taking in the number of people hiding behind tables at the back of the room. He brought a finger to his lips, motioning them to stay silent before returning his gaze to the man in front of him.
“Oh god,” said John suddenly “Oh, god, what have I done?” He looked down at the gun in his hand and paled. “I thought-- I was--” he fumbled for the right words “Did I hurt anybody? I didn’t know--” he sounded distraught. Sherlock smiled at him warmly, hoping that it was reassuring.
“Of course… and thank you.” John grinned up at him. “You know, we should hang out some time.” He said spontaneously. “Let me buy you a drink or something, after exams have finished.”
Any constructive feedback is welcome. This is my first time writing anything remotely smutty and I think it hasn't gone too badly. However if there are things that you think really didn't work then feel free to let me know (nicely of course :)). And of course, if there are things you particularly liked then, feel free to mention those too ;)
“Sister! There’s always something.” Sherlock muttered, before smiling back at John. “I’m glad, I didn’t scare you off. There’s something interesting about you.” He looked down at the text book. “Which bits are you finding difficult? I might be able to help?"
No, don’t panic. I have to observe, make my deductions, before reaching a conclusion. So, observe… what can I feel? I felt cold all over, a pressure on one side of my head. Oh, I was lying down on something, on something hard. Okay, that’s… good. More sensations, more input, what else can I feel? I felt numb, the space around me deafeningly silent. What happened? Don’t panic,
John rubbed his eyes blearily, pressing the heels of his hands against them, before slowly blinking his vision back into focus. He glanced around. The library had gradually quietened and emptied as the evening had drawn on. Shelves and shelves stacked high with knowledge loomed over the tables and chairs that stood neatly in the centre. The blueish light of a handful of computer screens glowed almost eerily, in parts of the room that had fallen into shadow, the motion sensor lights switching off one by one. Only a scattered handful of individuals remained, pouring greedily over coveted books. The occasional rustle of paper and the scratching of pens, interspersed with muffled music coming from someone’s head phones were the only noises to breach the near silence.
“I observed it.” he leant forward and grasped John’s wrist, “the watch, the strap has been engraved; ‘Harry, all my love, Clara’. It’s an expensive watch, so it must have been serious between them. It’s fairly new; he wouldn’t just give it away unless something had happened. If she had broken up with him he would have kept the watch, people do, sentiment, so he broke up with her. As for you two not getting on, the strap is scuffed, and the edges of the watch are scratched. I would say you are just a careless sort of person, but the rest of your things are immaculate. Your neglect of the watch is a subtle indication of the relationship you have with the person who gifted it to you.” He paused for breath. “As for knowing that you doubt your decision to go into medicine, you have been sat there for the last hour, staring into space and you frown when you look down at your book. For the record, I think you’d probably make an excellent doctor.” He smiled softly before dropping John’s wrist and resuming his position, his fingers against his lips.
“No, keep still. Don’t move, I need to get a look at you” John muttered speaking more to himself than to the man, whose life he held in his hands.
“Sherlock--” Lestrade looked as if he was going to follow before his radio crackled to life at his shoulder “Dammit!” he swore at Sherlock’s retreating back “Yeah, I’m here. Go ahead, Dimmock.”
“It’s okay. I’m here. I’ll stay here with you. Of course I will, you’re my best mate.” John reached down and took the man’s hand in his own, offering what comfort he could, speaking softly until he felt the man go limp and silent below him, his body emptying his soul to the heavens.
“I can’t!” John  spat at her “I didn’t get to say-- it doesn’t seem right to put those words out there, they should have belonged to him, I can’t put them into the world now he’s not here. I can’t”
should have seen this coming, I should have known. I should have-- I should have been there to stop you. Sherlock I am so so so sorry. I am so sorry” and then John broke down completely, his body convulsing under the weight of the emotion tearing through him, paralysed, unable to move. I wanted to leave but I couldn’t. I wouldn’t. And so there we sat for a long while, John curled up on the floor, amongst the broken glass and I, in my chair, my knees tucked under me, feeling lost and utterly broken.
Those first few months after Sherlock had been taken from him were unbearably painful. His entire life had crashed around him, leaving him howling alone in the rubble. Living with Sherlock Holmes was brilliant, incandescent, dangerous but life without him... it was unbearable, grey and so completely empty. More than once he had found his fingers wrapped tight around the sig. feeling the cool of the metal and its heft in his hands. But it had always been too heavy to lift to his temple and the trigger had always been too stiff to squeeze. John did not want to be in that world again. He loved Sherlock fiercely and he didn't know what that meant, but John couldn't live without him. Sherlock’s absence those two years had made that perfectly clear. He would not survive it again. He didn't yet know how but John was going to fix what had broken between them.
“A man, mid-thirties entered about 12. Then out of nowhere, he started shouting and pulled a gun. There are civilians in there with him, we don’t know for sure how many, maybe twelve, fifteen? He’s in between them and the exit. We’ve been reluctant to approach, without backup, we didn’t want to provoke him, no shots have been fired, but we haven’t been able to engage with him at all.”
“Okay” I nodded “but please, do everything you can to live a long life. I want you to be happy John and I am so sorry that that couldn’t be with me” I looked away momentarily, composing myself, “but yes, John, I’ll wait for you.” I closed my eyes and just for a moment I felt John’s fingers tighten around mine.
“Sherlock, I love you. I’m in love with you and I think I have been for quite a while. I’m sorry that I didn’t say it before, maybe things would have turned out differently, but there you go, now you know.” He smiled sadly, moving his hand into the space in between us.
The months passed and life settled into a routine for both John and Sherlock. The adrenalin fuelled excitement of cases interspersed with calmer, more domestic moments of takeaway, television and laughter. And John had started working at the surgery, taking up shifts as they became available. His nightmares became less and less frequent. Sherlock found himself missing him. As their friendship had blossomed into an effortless companionship during the day, Sherlock had found it easier to give voice to his feelings during the nights, when the air was thick with sleep, shrouded in the pre-dawn light and the knowledge that John needed him. Sherlock started letting himself into John’s room even if he was already sleeping peacefully. He would climb onto the bed next to him, enjoying the warmth of John’s body next to his, and he would talk. It helped him settle his own mind and clarify his thoughts. Speaking to John in this way was easy. It was on one of these nights that Sherlock finally gave voice to his sentiments. The moon was full and the light that trickled through the curtains cast everything in an ethereal silver glow. The dawn chorus was beginning to stir, their beautiful notes strung together into a delicate melody. And Sherlock Holmes lay next to John Watson, his hand resting gently upon his shoulder. It was then, in this half moment, that the words tumbled free from Sherlock’s lips;
“Actually, I just want to be alone right now.” John said, looking away, his gaze landing once again on me,”
(Please forgive any mistakes, I did proof-read it quickly but I was desperate to submit it. I might have missed some...)
“Wilson, thinks he might be having some sort of psychotic episode, he doesn’t seem to be aware of much going on around him. It fits with what the couple has told us as well.” Dimmock offered.
“You’re so beautiful.” He murmured almost to himself and then captured Sherlock’s gaze, burning and insistent. “I love you, Sherlock. I want to do right by you” Sherlock reached up, resting his palm against John’s cheek.
“I know” John said, his voice breaking “I think I know that. I just wish there was more I could have done.” I moved my hand forward, covering his with mine. Neither one of us could feel it but it didn’t matter. At that moment, it didn’t matter.
John’s shoulders visibly slumped “No. I-- I haven’t got myself sorted yet. There isn’t really anybody. I’ll be fine-- I guess”
“You’re in your first year of medical school. You’re actually wondering if you made the right choice, it’s harder than you thought it would be. You also have an older brother, who’s recently split up with his long-term girlfriend and you don’t get on with him for some reason, I can’t tell you why though.” He frowned, his brow knitting together. “I hate not being able to see everything.” He brightened as he returned his gaze to John’s.
John came late afternoon, with Mrs Hudson and they both stood a while talking. I withdrew a little, waiting until Mrs Hudson left and it was just me and John. I edged forward until I was stood in front of him, my headstone between us. I wish I could speak to him. I wish I could apologise, tell him how much I missed him. John looked thoughtful for a moment, trying to find his words.
“Oh God, yes, Sherlock please yes” John gasped, his head falling to rest in the crook of Sherlock’s neck. The smell of him; the fragrance of his rich soap, skin, arousal, it wrapped itself around him, engulfed him. Sherlock’s fingers slipped back under the waistband of his trousers. John’s breaths tore through the air, uneven and ragged, as Sherlock finally finally took him in hand.
“Please, please let me through. He’s my friend, he’s my-- Sherlock? He’s mine” he stuttered out, his voice thick with panic and grief. Dropping to his knees, his fingers closing over a wrist, feeling for a pulse, I knew he wouldn’t find, feeling the ghost of his coarse fingers grasping at my own wrist. He slumped back, the life seeming to drain from him, unable to hold himself up. “Oh God, no, no,” his voice shattering and breaking as he spoke. A nurse had knelt down beside him, supporting him, letting him lean into her shoulder. Oh God, what had I done?  The expression on his face clawed at my chest, pain and grief carved so deeply into his skin that his life seemed to pour out through the cracks, he looked as if he would shatter. And then everything happened very quickly. The crowd was cleared; a trolley pushed through, the body then lifted and placed, blood blooming across the sheet. And John remained kneeling on the ground, my blood saturating his jeans, his face in his hands.
“Sure,” he said, the smile dancing playfully across his lips, I'll let you buy me a drink, but only if you pass this exam.”
“Ha! No.” he laughed. “These,” he said letting his fingers dance over the top of his books, “are just a hobby. I’m actually a Chemistry student.”
Then he froze. Wait… the easy calm evaporated instantly. There was someone else in the room, their breath deep and even and entirely out of place. Sherlock swallowed heavily, trying to ignore the fear grasping at him with icy tendrils. No, not enough information, no need to panic, not yet.  He took a deep breath before blinking his eyes open and letting the room swim into focus. John? Sherlock let his eyes wander over the sleeping figure, who was propped up against the headboard, head falling onto chest, arms crossed. Sherlock sighed in relief, trying to slow his heart which was currently threatening to leap out of his chest. But what was he doing here? He rolled over onto his side so he could see John a little better. The motion seemed to disturb John, who blinked rapidly as he awoke. He started slightly as he realised where he was and then realised that Sherlock was awake and watching him, cautiously, curiously.
“Afghanistan or Iraq?” he said, his voice seeming way too loud. The man startled suddenly, his head whipping up, catching Sherlock in a piercing gaze. His grip on the gun had tightened also imperceptibly as he drew it to his hip, but he didn’t raise it.
“You came to sit with me because I was having a nightmare.” Sherlock murmured softly, carefully, trying not to disturb the fragile moment that was unfolding around them. John nodded and Sherlock smiled up at him, so gentle and soft, the fear finally receding from his gaze. “John,” Sherlock said as he slowly, deliberately slid his fingers across John’s skin, hovering for a moment over his pulse, thrumming steadily, in his wrist before tangling his fingers in John’s, his watchful eyes assessing and deducing. John faltered for a moment, overwhelmed and disorientated, before his expression changed, as if he had made a decision, and he allowed his thumb a brief caress against Sherlock’s palm.
“No, please. Stay… if you want. You don’t have to leave,” Sherlock said reaching out and grabbing John’s arm as he made to stand up. “I don’t mind,” he added, his voice barely a whisper.
His gaze shifted down to Sherlock’s lips as his thumb gently brushed against them. They parted slightly under his touch and John could feel his breath, hot, against his skin. He looked up to meet Sherlock’s eye, checking for his consent. Sherlock nodded minutely, his tongue darting out to wet his lips. Then before John had chance to move, Sherlock’s hands were around him, one resting in the small of his back, the other at his shoulder, and he pulled John to him, closing those last few inches and chasing away the last tattered remains of doubt. Another breath and their lips were pressed together. John’s eyes fluttered closed surrendering himself to the tide of emotion and sensation that poured over him, drowning in it. They stayed there like that, perfectly still, overwhelmed. John could feel the soft curve of Sherlock’s mouth against his own, the slight rasp of morning stubble, his fingers against his body. And then his instincts took over. One hand wound its way into Sherlock’s dark curls, the other against his jaw. He tilted his head slightly allowing their lips to slide together and John felt Sherlock sigh in his arms as he parted his lips slightly and breathed John in.
“I don’t know, when I got back from Bart’s I saw you there sat in your chair. I thought I’d gone mad. To be honest, I probably have.” He gave out a sharp laugh “but it’s been, comforting I suppose.” He shrugged. I swallowed, hard. I didn’t know what to say.
“No, no you didn’t but I should probably take this.” Sherlock offered his hand for the gun. John thrust it into his palm quickly. Sherlock clicked on the safety and dropped it into his pocket. As soon as the gun had been put away, he glanced over again at the coffee shop staff and customers. He motioned them forward, again indicating that they should be quiet as they left. John didn’t even look up. He was knelt down, his head resting in his hands. Sherlock reached for a bottle of water, unscrewed the cap and handed it to John, “here, drink this.” John took it and swallowed half the bottle down before speaking again.
I had followed him home, to Baker Street. I didn’t know what else to do with myself and I wanted to be near John. No, I needed to be near John. I wanted to reach out and touch him, let him know that I was ok, that it was all part of the plan, my brilliant amazing plan. But he couldn’t hear me, he couldn’t feel me. I had sat down in my chair and watched him, watched as the grief unfolded and watched as the weight of what had transpired began to suffocate him. I watched as he paced about the living room and I watched as he stalked to the kitchen and retrieved the unopened bottle of whisky and a glass. He slumped down heavily in his chair, eyeing mine almost suspiciously. He went to pour some whisky into the glass and then after a moment’s hesitation he rose the bottle to his lips instead.
His pupils widen and I regret my words already but I'd promised myself I'd tell him if he ever came back to me, so I push myself forward.
He sat down on his armchair, remembering that night was enough to fuel his anger anew. "I saw what he was doing and yes, rage took over me. It was instinct. I didn't stop to think about it."
"Jackson Brown?" Sherlock asked once the door was opened by a brown haired young man with an average height.
He actually wanted to say that she was his companion but thought better of it and stopped himself. 'She may not wish to be addressed like that,' He thought. There was no need to share that information with anyone beyond what is absolutely necessary, he could try to limit the number of people who knew about their bond to a minimum. It was the least he could do for her.
She got up with a sigh, washed her hands and face with ice cold water in the bathroom upstairs to regain at least somewhat of a control over herself and then slowly descended the stairs, as she had no other choice than to play along with her captive's little 'game', at least for a short while.
That must have been the weirdest sight she'd ever seen in her entire life! The club was crowded, some were dancing to the music, some others were talking to each other while drinking… And some of the vampires were feeding on... humans!
"I'm so sorry, John. Forgive me. I didn't know it would cause you so much pain," he whispers. Through the moonlight, I see honesty in his expression, and the sadness of realizing what he's done is clear in those beautiful eyes.
"Maybe. But I intended to save your life by keeping Moriarty away from you. Not to endanger it even more by dragging you into a fight against him."
"Shouting is pointless, if you haven't noticed yet. No one will hear you," he said as he walked over to her.
He could see why Joan had become a doctor as he watched the two women shake hands. She had a way of soothing and healing people and he could see that it had already begun to affect Sophia Miller.
"And here's a little something extra to put your mind at ease," he said softly. Before she could react or say anything, he had cut his fingertip with a pin and allowed two or three drops of his blood to fall down on each of his own signatures.
"So? None of the other companions look like that," she said, looking around the bar, "I mean some of them seem to be slaves, just as you'd said but that's not what's odd about him, he's just frozen over there. He looks... lost, adrift."
Having no alternative, she reluctantly followed him to the upper floor which consisted of a small bathroom and a single bedroom, furnished with a few pieces of furniture: a bed next to a large window, a wooden closet and a matching nightstand. It was obvious that this room hadn't been used frequently or even recently.
As Joan was busy trying to stop the bleeding, she suddenly noticed that the man had stopped squirming and didn't groan anymore like he did a few short moments ago; his hands didn't move anymore either. When she looked up at him, his eyelids were shut.
Death couldn't be so loud and painful and you don't hear other people calling out to you with urgency in their voice when you're dead. No; he wasn't dead, he couldn't be and yet he couldn't stop the disappointment that accompanied the comprehension of this fact surge through him. He only half opened his eyes, but that was still a good sign nonetheless. When his vision regained focus, he was surprised to still be alive and even more so to find a stranger by his side. "Who... are... you?" he asked in a barely audible tone when his eyes landed on her.
He was deep in thought for a moment."There's no other way. I'll have to risk it and get into the party," he said as he analysed the situation at hand over and over inside his head.
He's on Barts rooftop, I'm down on the street talking to him soothingly through the phone with a lump in my throat. He's crying, I can tell. I want to run to him, take him away from the edge and hold him in my arms and never let go. But he forbids me from moving towards him.
“Oh! You scared me.” She was startled and inhaled deeply. When he didn’t move or reply, she frowned. “Hey… are you alright?”
Sherlock isn't someone to experience feelings often. He'd started to shut his emotions down at an early age as he noticed that they did him little good and cost him way too high. And he grew to like that as people usually left him on his own when he did that. But in that moment, an unmistakable fear clenched around his heart. Was it the fear of being discovered? Or the fear of losing Joan and never seeing her again? But there was also rage, almost as strong as the fear.
Joan wakes up in Sherlock's flat and she has some questions. Let's see what happens. Kudos and comments much appreciated as always ❤ Hope you enjoy and happy reading!
"I don't have enough data and it may be some time before new evidence appears. So I'm avoiding boredom in the meanwhile."
The memory came back to her mind almost immediately. "No, I didn't. You just walked away. You didn't even let me call an ambulance."
He took a few printed photos out of the file in his hand and spread them on the table in front of her. They were photographs of a woman lying dead in some dirty looking living room. She looked up at him in shock, he sighed and rolled his eyes." Oh perhaps I should mention. I didn't kill her."
"I'm glad to hear that, Azalea but that's not the only reason that I've come here," Sherlock looked between the two vampires.
"No, leave him alone! " Another two men tried to get her out of the way, "Get off me!" She tried to shrug them off and push them away.
She took a deep breath to calm herself and sat behind the kitchen table, facing him. "Now, tell me more about these companions you spoke of last night. You said they're considered as properties. Are they like... I don't know, slaves?"
The three of them spent the whole afternoon going over the cold cases. Once the DI left, Joan looked across the table at Sherlock. "What was all that about?"
She swallowed visibly and stopped. "Just get it over with, go ahead," she'd found her voice now but it was shaking, "No need to prolong the misery,"
The positive effect he has on me is undeniable. I have no nightmares, no suicidal thoughts, no limp anymore. I'm simply happy; following him through the odd cases, listening to his violin at all hours of the day and making sure he eats and sleeps. My life's chaotic but good...
He's in my nightmare again that night. I wake up in tears to my own screaming but this time, he's by my bed, looking concerned.
"Sherlock Holmes isn't allowed to have any other companion or to lend his to other vampires under any conditions."
“I expected that you'd be unaware. He knows how difficult this is for you already so he wouldn’t place such an extra burden on you.”
"Oh God… Sherlock, look at this," She walked over to him after they'd searched the flat for twenty minutes in
"I just want you to trust me a little until I find out how to fix all of this mess, that's all. Don't you think that if I wanted to harm you or to kill you, I wouldn't have bothered with explaining any of this?"
As they were taking their seats somewhere at the back of the bar a few minutes later, a tall blond man caught Joan's attention. He looked a bit odd; he was exceptionally pale with green eyes and he was just leaning against a wall, watching the crowd with a blank expression. He had a very strong and athletic body but it was as if he wasn't fully present, like his mind was dwelling somewhere else. She kept watching him for at least fifteen more minutes from the corner of her eye but he didn't even move a single muscle.
Sherlock's hands raised to cover his mouth in an automatic reflex, (most likely to silence his own cries) but that was when his fingertips became red with more blood on his lips...
"Well; for one, I know you've had a long day so you naturally must be exhausted. And two, you'll find it in your best interest not to defy me."
But as if she'd read his thoughts, Joan interrupted him. She extended her hand to Sophia and said; "Joan Watson. I'm Sherlock's companion. My condolences. Wish we'd met under better circumstances."
Doubt; he finally managed to put a name on it; doubt was what was so heavy on his mind (and also on his heart); a kind of doubt that he'd never felt before. He'd always known right from wrong and had done what needed to be done. But this time, he didn't know if he'd made the right decision; he didn't even know what was the right thing to do.
Oleander brought up his right hand to stop all four of his men. "Joan Watson. Sherlock Holmes' companion," he muttered, bemused.
Two years have passed. I should let him go, everyone says so; but I simply can't. I should move out, get a new flat, but I know this is where I belong, where I'll always belong even if my body isn't here. No matter how hard I try, I'm unable to move on. Alcohol is my only friend and I barely get through my shifts at the clinic. Most days I don't sleep at all, when I do, there are nightmares... well, one nightmare. I see him die countless times in my dreams... I hear his words over and over again. Each time I wake up in tears to my own screams. I get through each day on autopilot. My mind almost never stops thinking about him.
Joan hadn't have a chance to pay much attention to his physical features until that moment. He was around 185 centimetres of height, his dark raven black curls contrasted with his extra pale skin and his black coat hugged his thin but slightly muscular body perfectly. His sharp cheekbones and piercing blue eyes made his features all the more dominant. "I'd say I'm glad to meet you but I'm really not and I'm a terrible liar."
He noticed his phone buzzing in his pocket. He took it out and glanced at the screen before picking up; "Mycroft, I'm busy.”
"I had no idea. I wish I had known about it sooner. I don't even know if he knows about all this,” she looked towards Sherlock's unconscious figure.
She had expected it to be painful and sure enough, there WAS pain (though it was much lesser than what she'd expected) but what caught her by surprise was how good it felt. Seeing Sherlock's vulnerability… fragility in that moment, the way he needed her and her blood, how hard he tried to be gentle, how connected they were (probably the bond had to do something with that too?) warmed her heart.
"We merely have a guess," Sherlock replied and then explained who they suspected in a few short sentences.
He inhaled deeply (another attempt to calm himself) but still kept eye contact; "What you did will not be forgotten. And make no mistake, I am not the forgiving type. This is far from over. Don't think for one second that you won't pay for your disobedience today," He said firmly and still evidently angrily but then he took a deep breath again and paused for a moment before he continued, "but you're obviously not in a fit state right now and neither am I. Go upstairs and rest before you make the cold even worse than it already is. We'll talk about everything later."
"He used to work for Jim Moriarty. No-one knows exactly what kind of work though. It was obvious from the first day that Moriarty had chosen him as a companion. The way he looked at Sebastian makes my stomach turn with disgust even now. Long story short, It happened eventually... he fed on Sebastian one night and other vampires were told to keep their distance from his companion. One year later Moriarty turned Sebastian into a vampire so that he wouldn't die of old age or sickness or any of the numerous miseries that afflicts the human nature."
"I told you not to try and trick me but you didn't listen. You tried to escape and this is how you'll pay for your disobedience. Plus, you asked to help with this case so you'll have to take the risks that come with it," he replied coldly and walked to his bedroom.
Remembering how nasty his wound had been, she couldn't help her next question. "How did you survive that horrible wound anyway? More importantly, how did he even manage to hurt you if you're a vampire? I don't think vampires can get hurt by the things that injure humans."
"Why do you think companions are considered as properties, Sherlock? On our side, there's the power of owning and on theirs, the security and comfort of being owned, being protected. It's not a shock that you want to protect what's yours; at least 'yours' in a sense."
"Because he's killed someone. I can prove it and he knows this. I wouldn't have survived if it wasn't for..." he stopped, not really eager to share the rest of that sentence with the likes of Venenum.
The memory was crystal clear in her mind; Sherlock sipping blood while facing the living room window on her first morning at 221B. "I saw him drink some blood the day I moved in here, but nothing since. I don't know. I can't be sure. He could have done it when I'm not there."
"In his mind, certainly. If you were to ask him; he’d probably say his arch enemy. He does love to be dramatic."
This couldn't possibly be his mind palace, no. He knew that place perfectly well (inch by inch to be fair) and this didn't look like his mind palace at all. It wasn't a memory either. He'd never been to a place like this before. He would have remembered if he had.
We get home and he plays his violin while I make two mugs of hot chocolate. Again he'd deny this if asked but he has a sweet tooth and loves chocolate.
"Bit of friendly advice? Do yourself a favour and run. Run and don't look back. Sherlock will shed blood sooner than later, he will kill; every vampire eventually does and despite what you believe, he's no exception. If you don't want to share the guilt of the blood that will be on his hands, then run away while you still have the chance. I was fine with this aspect of being a companion and I still am. I was a sniper before I met Jim and in a way, I'm still a sniper of sorts. Not much has changed for me after I became a companion. But I can see that you're struggling with it. You want to think that there's an out for me and therefore for you. That companions aren't affected as much as you fear by the vamps. Let me be clear, you're wrong. You're not cut out for being a companion and the guilt will eat you up if you don't put an end to it very soon."
Speak of the devil... There he was, standing in front of the large living room window with a violin in his left hand and a bow in his right, his fingers easily danced on the neck of the instrument. Despite the endearing action of playing a violin, there was something bitter about him. He was like an unbreakable statue made out of stone, an iceberg: cold, sharp and bound to destroy anything in his path. She could see that coldness even in the depths of his eyes. They were frozen... dead even, without even a trace of emotion in them to be seen.
"Don't. You heard me perfectly. You're just buying time to come up with a lie. But after what you've put me through, I deserve honesty. I'm asking again; What. Happened. To. You?"
He grinned. "I didn't need to search your bag to know that you're an army doctor. Your bag only provided me with your name because of your ID in it and nothing more. And I didn't 'know', I saw."
Suddenly her wound started aching again. Mycroft was right, this was a battle indeed. "Out of one battle and into another… well done, Watson," she whispered.
"You're solving a case and I can help. You said that you wanted me to trust you. Well, this is me trusting you."
Sherlock's lips turned into a thin line but he nodded and reached for a pen and paper. "Alright but remember that if you try to trick me, you'll face consequences."
"It's not possible for you to leave so you really should stop asking that." It was true, in a way, but Sherlock knew that deep down, he didn't even want her to leave. There was something different and unique about her that drew him to her and yet he couldn't begin to comprehend what it was.
Sherlock seated her down in an armchair and lit a fire in the long abandoned fireplace, hoping that it would (at least somewhat) warm and dry her. He truly didn't want a human to see who- no… WHAT he actually is but seeing another vampire trying to feed on her and then possibly kill her was more than he could bear and he had no other choice but to stop it.
Sherlock knew what his question really was; who is she TO HIM? He was completely aware of how strange all of this must seem. However he had no intention of answering that. "I said, she's WITH ME." He turned towards Joan; "So, professional opinion?"
She looked at the glass again and made up her mind. It wouldn't be an easy and painless way to die but even a horrendous death was infinitely better than anything that was awaiting her in this flat. She just needed to act fast enough and tolerate the pain for a few minutes (... or even just a few short seconds) and then it'd all end, she would be free.
The whole conversation replayed in Joan's mind over and over like a song that's been put on repeat but it made no sense. Did Sherlock really care about her safety? If so, why? Why didn't he trust Venenum? Who was this ‘Mycroft’ that he trusted so much? Joan decided not to mention anything about it to Sherlock. She just simply didn't know how to ask the questions she had in mind without sounding awkward or inappropriate.
After taking a minute to progress the events of yesterday, she looked around the small room. The fact that she'd actually managed to sleep at all was surprising even to herself. How could she sleep through an entire night in a vampire's flat? Alas, She was exhausted last night, no doubts about that, but the adrenaline and shock of the day's events should have been enough to keep her awake for days!
Then an idea occurred to her and she searched his pockets for his phone. Luckily, Sherlock had actually set emergency contacts beforehand. 'Mycroft' was the only contact available and as Joan now knew he was Sherlock's brother, she chose to call him instead of an ambulance. She held the phone with trembling hands and dialled the number.
"I'm a human; they won't hurt me. Plus aren't I supposed to be your companion anyway? They're not going to do anything to me." There was something new in her eyes, something that reached out right into Sherlock's heart.
"Of course. You are my brother's companion," Mycroft nodded at Sherlock who nodded back,"I'll be in touch," he said as he walked away towards his black expensive car which was waiting for him outside the building.
"He was so lost in his work lately. I was so worried for him so I urged him to go out to clear his head but he said that it could expose his secret. Finally, upon my insistence, he told me about this special bar for vampires and so I urged him to go there, at least for one night. Now I wish that I'd gone mute and hadn't said a word."
She was truly amazed and enchanted. Once she'd followed his train of reasoning, it had all become crystal clear. She could see the flame of wisdom burning behind his eyes now and wondered what it's like to see the world through a keen mind like his, "That was brilliant."
Sophia nodded and they both started looking around. She was obviously overwhelmed with emotions and memories but he decided to leave her be. She was entitled to be emotional after all.
"Like I said, I know that you won't hurt me. I'm your companion so this is the main reason I'm in your flat in the first place. I wouldn't accept being your companion or the contract if I didn't trust you. Plus, this is beyond just the two of us now; is it not? If you don't stop Moriarty, how many will die then? Because I know if you don't put an end to these murders now, no one else can. And if you confront Moriarty in this state, he and his people will kill you and afterwards they'll be unstoppable."
He nodded again and got up. Once he made it to the bathroom, he splashed his face with some water. It relaxed him a bit but that quickly vanished when he saw his own reflection in the mirror. He knew exactly what Joan had seen the night she was attacked: a pair of red eyes, long sharp fangs combined with a very pale skin. It was no surprise that she'd fainted at the sight. Sherlock wanted to punch the mirror just to break down his own reflection but what good would that do? Would this rage  change what he was? Would it make him any less of a monster? No. So what was the point anyway?
He copied the paper so that each of them would have one. Joan signed the papers first and then Sherlock did the same.
"Yeah, I suppose you have a point. Do you have any leads yet?" She asked, turning her head to look at him.
Joan had heard iall this as she was standing outside the room but she couldn't bear to listen anymore and ran upstairs to her room.
Her heart was about to jump out of her chest as she was surrounded by dangerous vampires but no-one even looked at her. It was very strange too because she saw vampires who had more than one companion and some vampires even exchanged their companions with one another to taste the blood of the other companion(s). Seeing all this awakened something inside her, she suddenly wanted to do something rash and save the companions. Fear and anger grew inside her veins; as if they were tiny pieces of ice crawling under her skin and through her entire body.
It was a fine flat; not too big but not too small either. A fireplace, a desk, two armchairs, a sofa and a coffee table made up the whole living room. Antiques could be seen here and there but overall, the owner's personal staff were scattered all over the place, making it look very untidy. One wall was almost completely a huge bookshelf which was filled with a considerable number of various books. A mirror was hung above the lit fireplace and a clock ticked steadily somewhere out of sight. Another wall was contained three large windows.
"Yes. His house had two floors, we each lived in one so it always felt like I had enough privacy of my own despite living in the same house with him."
"What kind of a fool do you take me for?! I saw the bruises on your body, bite marks, things like that."
"He's practically Moriarty's toy. He has Sebastian completely under his control. They are also a couple; always have been."
It takes months for him to fill in the details of what happened to him, bit by bit, and I spend every day taking care of the wounds he's suffered to protect me. Guilt punches me in the gut every time I see the damage, knowing I'm the reason behind the pain he's been through.
"If you're looking for your handbag, I'm not returning it anytime soon," he warned. He had already thought this through, she didn't have a way out. Joan froze and tears stung her eyes at the hopelessness of her situation.
"Hold on a minute, I'm breaking every rule letting you onto my cases." Lestrade protested, frowning.
"I know you're worried that I'll reveal everything but you have to trust me on this. Plus, think about it. I have no reason to expose you. It'll cause me more problems than I can deal with."
"But I can't go to a party dressed like this. I'll stand out horribly. And I don't have any other clothes than what I'm wearing."
Joan's sentence, however simple and unimportant it may seem to an outsider, managed to put a smile on Sherlock's lips. Hearing Joan address herself like that made him feel strangely and unexplainably... happy.
"Yes, she's much braver than I'd imagined her to be but that's beside the point." He paused for a moment and then continued; "I thought you'd left the irrational refusal to drink blood behind you. In those times, you hated being a vampire and wanted to kill yourself by starvation. So what has brought this back on?"
"Two. Same signs but apart from living in London and being vampires, they had nothing else in common. Different ages, different genders, different jobs, different parts of town, even different relationship status. But this isn't random, it's not an accident, someone's planned it all out and very carefully too. But I can't see the pattern."
"No. He didn't want me to meet other vampires. He barely even told me anything about the Venenum. I suppose he thought other vampires might hurt me or something."
"Nothing solid yet but I feel like I'm very close to it," she merely nodded. He was silent for a second before he continued, "You told her that you're my companion."
There was a tray on the nightstand next  to her bed, containing a bowl of soup, a glass of water, a loaf of bread and some pills. Sherlock had also left her a note: "I've ordered out some food for you. Don't be stubborn. Finish the soup and take those pills. We've already agreed that you won't kill yourself, and that includes starvation."
"If you've heard me and Mycroft talking, then you know that there's a good chance I might not be able to control myself if I feed on you."
"One last thing," he took a jewelry box off his desk and handed to her. "Joan, if I ask you to wear this tonight and not to question why, would you do it?" he asked softly.
"I ordered dinner for you. Should be here in a few minutes," he said casually without even looking up from his microscope. "Oh, by the way, was it Afghanistan or Iraq?" He asked, now abandoning his microscope and picking up a file.
So Joan's having a cold (given the circumstances of the first chapter, it's not surprising 😁) what will Sherlock do? What's awaiting them?
"Gay? I'm not. I'm bi." This time I can't bring myself to look into his (beautiful) eyes. "Christ. I don't even know if you date men. I just ruined everything, didn't I? I'm sorry, Sherlock. Forget I ever said that, ok?"
She forced herself to do as Sherlock had said in the note, she knew it was the right (and logical) thing to do in order to hasten her recovery. She was secretly grateful for the food and the pills as they helped her feel better but doubts about Sherlock (and of course, his intentions) still clouded her mind. She didn't know what to think of him. For all she knew, he could be doing all these nice things so that her blood would taste better when he would feed off her.
"Then I need you to tell me everything you can about him. Any detail, however small might prove essential to solving this case."
She was very surprised to find Sherlock standing under the moonlight coming from the window in the kitchen. He had his back turned towards her; slightly bending over the counter as his hands were gripping the edge of the counter and supporting his weight, his head hung low.
He seemed to be weighing his options for a moment. "Look, tomorrow night, there'll be a party at a bar. It's famous amongst my kind as it's one of the very rare places that vampires are free and allowed to show who they truly are. I think the next target will be someone from the guests."
Terror filled her heart as she looked up from her now bleeding palm to Sherlock, knowing exactly what the blood was doing to him and also that she had absolutely no chance of surviving through this situation now. Any tiny piece of hope she had of getting out of his flat alive disappeared. The smell of blood filled the air between them and they both froze for a moment, her eyes were fixed on him, and his on her bleeding hand.
"If not for your own, for the sake of your poor companion and her mental health, put your stubbornness aside for once in your god damn life," Mycroft warned bitterly but firmly the next morning as he watched his brother's eyes begin to open.
"Sebastian Moran killed Benjamin and threatened Sophia's life. I saw your texts. You gave him Benjamin's address," Sherlock said with an accusing tone.
Joan sighed softly and their eyes locked once more. "You." Sherlock frowned in confusion. "The first night I was in this flat; you told me lies break trust so you wouldn't lie to me because you wanted me to trust you."
"But why would you care about a human like me? And don't tell me you felt indebted to me because of the night I tried to help you because I won't buy it. I saw your face when you rescued me... you were mad with rage, you almost killed the guy who attacked me."
As he looked around in confusion, one of the newly dug graves caught his attention. *'Joan Watson'* was carved on the gravestone. He took a few unsure steps towards the grave but he immediately regretted his decision.
Joan nodded. "Ok." She gently took it and stood in front of the mirror above the fireplace as she put the necklace on. Her hand stroked it as a way of silently appreciating its beauty.
Throughout this fic, I will put in a few OCs (chapters that are made up by me); they're not gonna be overly important to the story if I'm being honest but they'll be side characters.
"Not as much as humans. We don't really need sleep like humans do. It just serves as a restart button for us to be honest."
Suddenly Joan's body finally caught up with her mind and she rushed to stand in front of him in his defence. She couldn't let this happen, It wasn't fair. Both as a soldier and as a doctor, she had a strong conscience that wouldn't allow her to rest in the future if she let Sherlock be accused of something he hadn't done in this moment.
It had been a very long, stressful and exhausting day for her; she'd been puked on twice by her patients and had gotten blood all over her uniform three times in less than twelve hours. She lived close by and a short walk always helped to relax her so she often took a walk back home instead of taking a cab, unless she was in a hurry or the weather was exceptionally terrible. At that moment, she just wanted to go home, eat some takeaway and then catch a few hours of sleep before she had to return to work the next morning.
Sherlock watched the night sky through his bedroom window. Stars winked at him and he couldn't help but wish that he could be as far from the earth as those blinking stars were.
"I think it actually is," a rather long pause; " Just don't let the matter get out of hand. No one will like the consequences, least of all, you yourself."
Seeing (and smelling) all the blood made him crave it more and this dark desire made him sick. He tried to shout, tried to cry out, tried to move, but all in vain. He just fell to his knees due to gravity as his legs wouldn't hold him up anymore and his body shivered uncontrollably. Joan was the only one he didn't wish to hurt in the whole world, the one person he'd done so much to protect (even from himself... no, SPECIALLY from himself) but now he'd given in to the monstrous side of himself and had taken her life. He wished that the earth beneath him would open its mouth and swallow him whole right there and then.
"I'm not. You're coming with me. Hurry up!" He said as he dashed out of the room and she followed after him once she'd grabbed her own coat.
Joan jumped towards the table and smashed down the glass, then picked up the biggest shard that she could see. She tried to act as fast as she possibly could but before she could finish what she'd started, he grabbed her by the arms.
She removed the bloody piece of cloth from her wrist before entering the bathroom, her wound had healed nicely. She found some clean towels in the bathroom so she tried to focus on relaxing and enjoying the shower she'd longed for since she'd stepped into this flat.
"I'm a vampire and I also work with the police. I think it'd be in your best interest if you tell us the truth," Sherlock stepped closer.
"That's strange…" Sherlock whispered thoughtfully. "Our laws don't allow vampires to hurt other companions. Why did he feel like they'd be a threat to you?"
"How can you possibly know about the army? Nothing in my handbag could have indicated that and I certainly didn't tell you about it. And only a handful people know about it but you wouldn't possibly be able to contact them."
"No! This is supremely serious, Sherlock. According to your companion, you haven't fed in over a week."
She didn't like the way he ripped her choices from her since the moment they'd seen each other. It infuriated her and made her feel like she couldn't make her own decisions and he was controlling her. "Being a blood bag? A puppet for you to play around with? A slave? No. That is not any better. I'd rather take my own life." Her voice rose due to the anger but whether the shaking was because of fear or pain, she couldn't tell.
Joan really didn't mind dying, to be honest, never have actually but whatever Sherlock had planned for her was far worse than death or torture or imprisonment. To her, death with dignity was much better than becoming… whatever he wanted her to be.
Once he was assured that Sherlock had enough blood in him and his starvation didn't pose any potential threat any longer, Mycroft left 221B. He wasn't sure why Sherlock wished to protect his companion so badly, even from himself, but he'd promised to protect her and he would keep his word.
"Hello?" He listened for a brief moment. After he disconnected the call and put his phone in his pocket, he looked at her. "We're going out," he said as he picked up his jacket.
"I hadn't had the courage to go to Benjamin's place since he'd passed. I'd been staying with a friend. I just couldn't bring myself to face it. But he'd left everything he owned to me in his will so the lawyer sort of pushed me to go back there. I would have to go there someday eventually so I thought I'd get it over with. When I walked in, someone else was inside. A blond, tall young man. I only saw his back, he ran off so quickly. After that, I could sense being followed everywhere."
"I'll be... fine. I simply... need some… time… and rest,"  he muttered as he tried to get himself into a sitting position between groans and gasps.
"I'm someone who's trying to save your life. Now, do your best to stay awake for as long as you can manage," she ordered. The bleeding had finally slowed down a bit so she managed to examine the wound properly now. "I've seen far more than my own fair share of wounds but I've never seen anything like this. What in God's name were you stabbed with?"
Her voice broke on the last sentence and Sherlock waited a minute before he said: "You've been very brave and of great help to solving this case, Miss Miller."
Joan was right and they both knew it. There was no one else to put an end to these murders. Even if there was, Moriarty would kill them before they could do anything. Besides, Sherlock knew that he couldn't avoid feeding on Joan forever, she was his companion after all; it was inevitable… sooner or later it was bound to happen, one way or another. All he was able to do was to try and control himself the best he possibly could.
"I can't see any sign of struggle on the body. No wounds either. She passed out, probably choked on her own vomit. Could have been alcohol or drugs. I see a few half-empty bottles of alcoholic drinks on the table in the photos so that's my best guess based on just a few photos."
She wanted to talk more about this issue with him but his phone buzzed in Sherlock's pocket and interrupted their conversation. She moved to leave the room but Sherlock motioned her to stay.
"Good." He was about to walk out the door but then turned around and shot a final threatening glance at her, “Don’t even think of trying to trick me. Don't play games with me. I'm warning you, it won't work." That being said, he was gone in a heartbeat.
Yet Sherlock slowly took a piece of a clean cloth and gently handed it to her to wrap it around her wound. He knew exactly what was going through her mind as their eyes locked for the first time. "I meant what I said earlier. If I wanted to kill you, you'd already be dead," he answered the unasked question lingering between them, "If you cooperate, nothing bad will happen to you. So, do both of us a favour and stop trying to kill yourself. Alright?"
"You got Benjamin killed; that's what Sherlock is going on about. He was smart, he'd managed to hide but you gave him away. Me and Benjamin were never together. I concealed his identity, lies to you to keep you and him from harm's way but you got the man who protected me and your baby for years killed. You found out what Benjamin was but you couldn't put together that I was a companion?"
Silence fell on the room as the two detectives stared at each other. "Yes, I do. God help me," Lestrade sighed and rubbed his forehead in desperation.
"With multiple vampire murders going on, I don't think this is really a good time for such a conversation." He moved to walk away but Joan blocked his way out of the kitchen.
"Are you alright?" She asked softly,"Mycroft didn't really explain any of it. He just said that… well, he said you've been starving yourself."
Vampires don't interfere with one another's feedings; it's one of their very strict rules, but this was very different. Putting aside the personal reason that Sherlock's thoughts had been about little else except for that specific young woman in the past forty-eight hours, that vicious vampire was about to feed on a human in PUBLIC . The rules ban vampires from feeding out in the open. It's too risky and can expose the
"You've set emergency contacts on your phone. For a vampire, I just found it a bit odd; unless, well… if you were expecting something really bad to happen to you and felt under threat."
"Maybe they simply enjoy the harmony," she said, trying to focus on their topic to avoid thinking about the glass.
Joan tried to be as calm and gentle as possible but her hands were shaking and it took a bit longer than usual to inject in the IV. She’d been to war and had seen her friends die bloody, she'd operated on a soldier on the battlefield while bombs went off around them but her hands had never shaken. Her old wound whined at her emotional instability and for some reason, it hurt her to see Sherlock like that more than it would hurt to be in his place. She watched his motionless face as the blood poured into his body through the IV.
Oleander sighed and rolled his eyes. "Take him away now. Get him out of my sight. I've had enough of him," he ordered wearily and Sebastian was taken out of his hiding place by Venenum's people.
"What are you gonna do to me?" She asked as he slowly backed her to the metal door. Joan closed her eyes and was panting slightly, she expected him to attack her any second now and tear her apart.
"If I wanted you dead or wanted to hurt you, I would have done it already. And I also believe I had a better chance at that while you were passed out, wouldn't you say so?" He spoke in a low tone. His right hand was now resting on the door, next to her face.
Joan finally meets Lestrade in this chapter. Then we're back on the vampire homicides case and Sherlock is questioning a witness. Happy reading! 😍🥰
Joan looked up at Sherlock in shock. There was only one person fitting that description the night of Benjamin's murder at the bar. "Do you think-? It can't be him, can it?"
"I told you before - because that was the only thing that would make him stop. And I did owe you one after all."
Suddenly his phone started to buzz and after a shot a glance at the screen, he rose to his feet and shrugged on his black suit's jacket; "I have to go out. I'll be back soon."
"I've got one or two, yeah." Understatement. She had a thousand questions that flooded her mind like a hurricane.
"You'll disagree with that in a maximum of six months. Nature is full of magic and mysteries and you'll come to appreciate them very soon," Oleander chuckled dryly, "we grant her our protection. Companions are a part of our community and in being your companion, from now on, so is she."
"You poisoned those two vampires because Moriarty ordered you to do so. There was a third target but when you and Moriarty found out Benjamin had something that you wanted, you chose him as the next target instead. But he was a step ahead of you and had already left everything to Sophia. You wanted to steal what you were looking for but she saw you. You'd rather kill her than let her get away but you had strict orders not to do anything to reveal the secret of our kind's existence. So you fled from the scene and talked to Moriarty afterwards. Then you two agreed that Sophia was a witness and a great risk so she had to be eliminated. Nothing- not even your own life mattered more than what Benjamin had left to her so you kept on chasing her."
Sherlock smiled a little. "I didn't know. I saw. It's not too complicated honestly. Just seeing a few short golden hairs on your shoulder was enough to let me know that you've been holding a small girl. My other deductions only lead me to the assumption that it was your own daughter."
Neither of them was gonna give up easily but Sherlock turned out to be at least twice as strong as his opponent. "SHE'S MY COMPANION! MINE!" He growled as his hands tightened their grip on the other vampire's throat. Sherlock didn't know why his mind had chosen those words. It was a slip of the tongue, but it had come out so naturally, like a long-held truth finally being given a voice. He was so blinded with rage that he doesn't really remember what happened next, but his anger seemed sufficient to set the other vampire running off at full speed once he saw the first opportunity to escape.
With incredible difficulty, Sherlock pulled away from John's lap and walked with deliberate purpose to the small side table next to the leather couch in the sitting room. Sherlock felt John's eyes on each part of his body, and that was fine. More than fine. It had been years since Sherlock ever felt this desperately wanted.
"Yeah," John moaned, his breath hot and heavy against Sherlock's neck. He pressed his forehead against the underside of Sherlock's jaw and held on for dear life as the pleasure built. "Close… don't stop."
Usually, Sherlock would whisper John’s name in these situations. It helped John wake up to the sound of a lulling voice, but tonight Sherlock instinctively touched his hand to John’s right shoulder. The gentle caress was enough for John to open his eyes, and the tenseness in his face left at once.
“Good,” John replied back, his expression somewhere in between fondness and something else that didn’t have a name, but it made Molly’s eyes feel suddenly wet. Like stepping out into a meadow of lovely flowers that assaulted her allergies.
“I’m sorry about what…” John began, his words somewhat muffled as his lips were against Sherlock’s neck. “...it’s...I have no excuse for how I acted, or more how I
“It still smells like him,” John whispered, his clouded eyes only staring vaguely in Greg’s direction. “Why does it still smell like him? It’s fucking mad...fucking mad.”
Weeks passed. Sherlock drifted in and out of his mind palace like a spectre, half here, half there. A couple of clients stopped by, but the cases were quick, over within a couple of hours. He felt alive for a second, the taunting echoes finally leaving him for a moment, but the second the case was finished they returned in full force.
There was now a very sour taste in Sherlock’s mouth that he wanted desperately to get rid of. Molly meant well. She always did, but she was crossing the line in any opinions she had regarding what cases Sherlock should and shouldn’t take.
“Good morning,” Sherlock says brightly once John hurries into the kitchen. John feels his mouth open in shock. The kitchen is spotless except for two empty mugs on the table. Even the floor looks as if it has been freshly cleaned. “Sit down, then. I’ll have tea ready in a few minutes.” He flicks the kettle switch, and the water inside immediately starts boiling. He must have used it recently, then. Had Sherlock been waiting for John to wake?
John nods, and Leah gives him a quick hug before walking him out of her flat. The smell of her perfume still lingers on his collar as the taxi takes him back to Harry’s home, but all John can think of is Sherlock, and what the hell he is supposed to do to close that door that Leah spoke about. Or if he even wants to.
Over the next few weeks, Sherlock is almost constantly creating something, all in the name of the case. Sometimes it’s art, sometimes it’s just a mess, but he seems to settle on using oil paints on medium-sized canvases. He tried a larger canvas, one that was almost the size of his entire body, but it took days to paint and took up far too much space in the sitting room. Mostly, Sherlock paints John. John at his laptop, John drinking his tea with steam unfurling beneath his nose, John sat in his chair by the fire.
John found out that he’s bisexual because he fantasises about me, and why are the walls suddenly getting closer?
The only problem? The repo men weren’t exactly stupid. They’d hired a security company to watch the outside of the building, making it harder for John to get inside. Difficult, but not impossible. The time came, and he watched the security guard pass by the door. As soon as he was out of sight, John moved. All he had to do was get in, take the package from the woman, and get out. He’d drop the bundle off at a locker at Victoria Coach Station where his payment was waiting, then wash his hands of the job.
Sherlock huffs a mirthless laugh. “He’s Mycroft; he figures everything out eventually. Maybe he reinstalled the cameras in the hallway.”
“It’s okay,” Sherlock murmured into John’s ear, gently letting go of John’s cock and unzipping his own fly. He only slipped a few fingers beneath the waistband before John caught his wrist.
John was a bodyguard. Not for some illustrious firm or even a nightclub. If anyone had called him a hired hand, he would have shot them down with a single look while inwardly agreeing with them. He’d been a spy in Afghanistan for Her Majesty. Posing as a simple army doctor, John had smuggled information in and out of Afghanistan that had saved countless lives. He’d learned early on how much he enjoyed the thrill, the constant stream of adrenaline running through his veins. Life in London, as a civilian, had not been appealing. So he’d created his position as
“You’ll be fine,” John says, still chuckling. “I’ll be showing you what to do beforehand. Now, take a few deep breaths and bring out your wings.”
"But in all seriousness, John...maybe the clue is more concrete than you think. Part of a bigger puzzle."
When his timeline began to show him things he’d already read, John turned off his computer. Placing it back in the travel case, he laid back on the bed and absently stuck a hand down his pants. He couldn’t get the tweet out of his head. Cheating was, in John’s opinion, an all-time low. Granted, without it, he’d be out of a job more often than not. A decent chunk of his clients were women trying to escape their cheating partners or abusive relationships. Still, even in his worst relationship (a boy in his thirteenth year), cheating on him had
John’s chipper voice is the very last thing that Sherlock wants to hear right now. If it were up to him -
“Bollocks to history, and whatever the hell else you’re going to give as an excuse.” Harry downs the rest of her coffee, then places the empty mug on the table and turns to face him. “Look, Johnny...I couldn’t put the effort in. I was drowning myself in a bottle of vodka every night for God’s sake; I couldn’t even begin to repair our relationship until I’d taken a good look at myself. You can. If you want to keep him, you have to try. It won’t be easy, but if you really love him, you owe him that. Do the work.”
He needed to know John. Needed to memorise every square inch of his body, understand each pressure point and erogenous zone. If he could discover exactly how to pull John Watson apart, maybe it wouldn’t matter if Sherlock’s brain wandered. He thought back to the first time, the frenzied give and take in the kitchen. John had given an uncontrolled moan each time he’d twisted his wrist on the upwards stroke, and had thrust into his hand whenever Sherlock’s thumb brushed over his frenulum. Sherlock closed his eyes and filed the data away into his mind palace. If he collected enough, would a pattern emerge? Could he create some sort of formula, the secret to pleasing John Watson? Perhaps. But first, more input — he needed to explore John’s body, try out different techniques and memorise his responses.
John instructs the cab to pull over a couple of minutes away from Baker Street. His palms are beginning to sweat, and he still hasn’t decided what to say. Hell, he’s not even sure this is a good idea. His body moves on autopilot, tracing those familiar steps from Melcombe Street down to the corner of Baker Street, whilst his mind desperately tries to think of something to say.
“You all right?” Sherlock asks, his hand still tightly interlaced with John’s as another float goes by. This one is a shimmer of pink and gold with women of every shape, size and colour dancing in step to Lady Gaga’s
“Give us a moment,” John chuckles. “Apparently I’m a bit long winded with these things. Sherlock...will you marry me as well?”
“Wow.” John murmured. “How did you see all of that? That’s incredible,” he swallowed deliberately, trying to pull himself together. “I’m John, by the way.” He held out his hand.
“Okay, then let me just sit here for a while” she moved to sit in my chair. John stared at her in horror and she faltered.
“I didn’t. I’ve always remembered things like this. It was instinctive. Actually, it was years before I realised that other people’s minds didn’t work the same way as mine.” Suddenly, a phone beeped loudly. Sherlock frowned, wriggling his phone out of his trouser pocket. He stared at it for a moment, before leaping up. “I’m afraid I have to go. It was nice meeting you John.”
I had disappeared to my bedroom when I had arrived back at the flat. I could hear John clattering around in the kitchen preparing food and making tea. A little while later I could hear the low sound of the TV. It was comforting.
“No, there’s no point in me studying medicine. I have no interest in becoming a doctor,” the stranger smiled wryly.
Sherlock considered for a moment. He was overwhelmed but desperate for stimulation. He was going out of his mind with the boredom. He’d had been pacing his flat, pulling at his hair, trying to resist the temptation. It was like his brain was itchy on the inside and he was struggling to scratch at it. He recognised the warning signs and it scared him. After what had happened the last time-- no he couldn’t do that again.  To be honest, he thought, that was probably one of the reasons Lestrade had insisted on involving his in this recent case, it was only a 3 or a 4 at best, he barely had to glance at the crime scene to read the answers that were written there, but it had got him out of the flat and it had been distracting even if only for a moment. He sighed, his shoulders slumping slightly. “Fine, I’ll come” he snapped, but without much of its usual bite. He hoped Lestrade hadn’t noticed.
“I don’t know” John replied “This is crazy. I don’t even know you’re name. I don’t know why I trust you, I never trust anybody.”
“I’ll deal with the police. Have you got anybody to call? A friend, a relative? I don’t want to leave you alone right now.”
“You were always so much more than that John. I needed you.” I couldn’t help speaking out then; even knowing he couldn’t hear me. Did John really believe that? “You helped me see things, to understand things. No-one else could do that. You were instrumental to my work John and you were my--” I faltered as John began to speak again.
Sherlock allowed himself to be drawn back into consciousness. He felt content and rested in a way that had been evading him for months. He kept his eyes closed, taking a second to enjoy the moment of peace; a kaleidoscope of sunlight across his eyelids, the softness of Egyptian cotton against his skin. He smiled, letting it tug at the corners of his lips. He hadn't realised how much of a strain the nightmares were putting him under. He slowly stretched the stiffness out of his muscles. Maybe today was going to be a good day. He took a deep breath and relished the whisper of it against his skin on the exhale.
I blinked my eyes open in that instance. The stream of information that suddenly assaulted me was overwhelming. The light seared across my vision, blinding. And the noise, there was so much noise. People shouting, screaming, a car horn, an alarm sounding somewhere! I blinked desperately, the scene around me slowly drawing into focus. I was stood, not lying down, on the pavement outside Bart’s hospital. There were people everywhere. I scanned the crowd quickly, making my deductions; three nurses, a doctor on a cigarette break, the women in the long coat, well she was a teacher, primary school obviously, a couple who were here to visit a sick relative, the flowers abandoned at their feet, all of them their eyes wide; pain, fear, sadness. I found myself drawing closer to the epicentre of their attention, a sickening feeling growing in my stomach. Another small step forward and then I could--
“I heard-- you were having nightmares. It sounded horrible, Sherlock. I wanted to make sure you were alright. I’m-- I-- I should go--“
John stared after him for a moment, reflecting back on what had just happened and then he smiled to himself before turning back to his book with a renewed sense of determination.
Lestrade pounced on him as soon as he reappeared, pulling him to the side “Never do that again! I mean thank god nothing went wrong but you couldn’t possibly have known that.” Lestrade looked over Sherlock’s shoulder to where John was standing “We should probably take him in, get a statement, make sure he’s ok.”
“Good, I love you Sherlock” John murmured once again. And then I felt myself fading away, the darkness surrounding me. John’s words burning incandescently in my mind, my last thought as I ebbed away
“Okay” Ella said decisively, shutting her notebook “We’ll finish here for today, but John…” she leant forward in her chair to rest her hand against his forearm “You can call me at any time. You need to talk to people, if not me someone else. You don’t have to do this by yourself.” John did not look at her; she waited a moment before withdrawing her hand, allowing him to stand.
“John, please-- I don’t want to die. Please-- please don’t leave me” his voice cracked and broke and a tear escaped and ran down his cheek. John finally looked to the man’s face and when he did, he could feel himself cracking and breaking into pieces.
A few minutes later they pulled up in front of the café, part of the street had been cordoned off, and there was already one other police car present. Sergeant Dimmock was talking into his radio looking flustered. Sherlock swung open the car door before Lestrade could even pull to a complete stop and slam on the handbrake. Dimmock spotted them and waved them over, a small humourless smile across his lips.
“John?” Sherlock panted against John’s lips, the question hanging in the air between them as Sherlock’s fingers danced over the waistband of John’s pyjama bottoms. A finger-tip slipped just below, offering a gentle caress against John’s hip before it withdrew.
“Do you mind if I join you?” a deep voice intruded. John jumped, snapping his head back up and watched as a tall, gangly looking student deposited a tower of books on the table, pulled out the chair opposite John and flopped down into it, without waiting for a response. John didn’t know what to say. He was pretty sure he hadn’t seen this him before. He would have remembered him, he was beautiful. The light caught on his pale skin and sharp cheekbones, his dark hair in messy curls, springing up, unruly, from his head.
“Don’t apologise. You haven’t done anything wrong. Were you having a flashback?” Sherlock ventured. John seemed to be more aware of what was going on around him. He had stopped shaking, his posture relaxing ever so slightly. He looked sad as he answered.
A giggle rumbled through John’s chest as he nodded. The boy smiled back, evidently proud that he had been able to make John smile. Even in the tiny bit of conversation they'd had so far, the child’s English was exceptional.
Sherlock and John figure out the physical boundaries of their relationship, one small touch at a time.
frotting. Loved the way Sherlock’s cock felt against his, the added pleasure they both felt as their tips slid together. It was quite possibly John’s favourite thing to do, even if it did end in a mess. The mess was half the fun. “Come for me, and I’ll use it as lube,” he begged while moving both his hand and his hip to increase the tempo. “You can watch me. I know you like that when I use your come to get myself off.”
“And I mean every word of it...unfortunately for my dignity. I assume that it’s on holiday with Kraig’s.”
Sherlock watches John for just enough time for John to realise what the detective is doing. He’s seen it before. Sherlock going over all of the information — old and new — and deducing the best resolution. It’s a waiting game, but it isn’t the first time John has had to be patient. This is worth it. This will always be worth it.
“Yeah,” John answered, and by the panting quality of his voice, Sherlock wondered if he had run all the way to the morgue from the front entrance. “Got Molly’s text...and took the first cab here.” John rounded his glare at Sherlock. “Why didn’t you tell me that you came about the case? I would have headed over straight away.”
“Our pal Michael Pierce?” John smirked, running a free hand through Sherlock’s curls. Sherlock froze, just for a second, trying to decide whether he liked the sensation. It wasn’t unfamiliar to him, the gentle pull of John’s fingertips across his scalp, but here? He couldn’t decide how he felt about it.
It had been three days since he’d replied to that bloke’s Twitter post, and he hadn’t managed to find the time yet to see if he’d offended him. So, deciding that now was as good as ever, he brought up Twitter and was surprised to find he had a reply. John barked out a laugh when he read the reply and instantly regretted it when the contents of his stomach shifted. He stopped laughing, smirked instead, and hit
Sherlock’s mobile vibrated again, and Sherlock quickly checked the message. The older man across from him pointedly cleared his throat.
“Yes,” Sherlock says, glancing down at his own private notes. His scribbles line the edges of the page, some encircled with phrases like
close, but then...this." John gestured to the two lines of prose as if it had foiled a well-constructed plan. "It's as if he's trying to give me hope. A flash of light in the darkness that he needs me to follow."
“I thought that you’d be more appreciative of me coming onto...your preferred battlefield, so to speak.”
“I always mean it.” They turned and caught each other's gaze, and it was impossible for Sherlock to look away, even if he’d wanted to. It felt like that first time, the buildings of London streaks of grey as John had said almost off-handedly that Sherlock was brilliant.
There was a period, towards the end of their meal, where it abated, if only for a moment. After a particularly flirty joke, John sank back into his seat and let his foot brush against the side of the detective’s leg. At first, Sherlock thought it was an accident, but then John let it travel further up his calf, towards his thighs. Sherlock let out a sly smile. Oh, here was a game he could play.
Another kiss and John exploded over Sherlock’s beautiful hands. The weight of ecstasy was everywhere for them to deal with in some other galaxy, where things like clean up actually mattered.
Sherlock felt his own cock throb at the memory of what his mouth could indeed do, and what John’s mouth happily did in return.
John gives a mechanical nod and spends the rest of his visit with Harry trying to fight the desire to grow a horrible mustache, change his name and to never ever drink again. He even feels too defeated to argue with Harry when she insists on paying for a cab back to his bedsit. As he begins to meander upstairs, however, the soldier within him catches a rustling sound coming from his
It doesn't help that Sherlock seems to view clothing as of late as a general bother. His nudity is on display in so many places in the flat that John might as well be living in a day spa with only one very posh member. John is apparently the staff, and practically cleans the flat top to bottom to mitigate his sexual frustration.
“He gave you all the information to find him before you ever came here, Dr. Watson, though this was one of the easiest sessions I’ve had in a while.”
Thankfully, Sherlock finally opens his mouth and begins to speak. The words crackle in his throat as if saying each and every one of them is causing him a relentless amount of pain.
And that was it, that was all the warning he was able to give Sherlock before his thrusts became erratic, and he fell forward onto Sherlock's chest. His body was completely boneless. If he'd needed to escape from a burning fire, he wouldn't have been able to move even a single toe. He was undone, fully and completely, and only vaguely aware that Sherlock hadn't come yet.
And here it was again, so many years and situations removed. The gentle caress of what Sherlock knew was pure happiness, and now it was firmly attached to the man who had clumsily asked him if he had a boyfriend in a candlelit restaurant.
Sherlock grunts as he gets up and throws his hands up in pure frustration. His head is pounding now with the sounds of his name echoing into his skull. The tone is an agonised mixture of ferocity and desperation, and then, more words.
The whip dropped to the floor and within a few steps sat on the foot of the bed to take off her shoes. The delicate toes wiggle once they are freed.
,” John bellows out. His heated breaths are coming out in sharp exhales and his eyes closed tight. “Sherlock…yes…”
Another sip, and Irene moves a little closer, and Sherlock reflexively does a quick check to see if she’s carrying any weapons. It wouldn’t be the first time that
Sally was trained to read people and prepare for potential reactions. In her mind she had known this day would come, but the restraint that John was showing was not in any scenario she had foreseen. She knew John to have a temper, even though it was usually more of a second hand understanding than anything else. Yet here he sat as if she had just proclaimed that the weather was going to be rainer than first expected.
“Which doesn’t make sense,” Sherlock concluded. “Unless the victim struggled, and the killer needed the extra leverage the scarf provided. But because the MO didn’t fit their previous kills, they didn’t want to claim it.”
“It’s fine, John. Go back to sleep.” Sherlock murmured into John’s hair, pulling him closer and taking a deep inhalation of the remnants of John’s cologne; sage and cedarwood. They were here, now, in each other’s arms. That was all that mattered. John shook his head as if he didn’t want their talk to be over, but his sleepiness was winning the battle.
Once his legs stopped shaking, and his vision had cleared up, John bent down over Sherlock’s still boneless body and kissed him square on the lips. He ran his thumb over Sherlock’s jaw and cheekbone, then chuckled when Sherlock made no signs of moving.
"There isn't anything I wouldn't do to you," John sighed, unable to spare any more energy into raising the volume of his voice. He'd need that energy later if he played his cards right. "I want you on your knees, and I want to be on
It was obvious in the photo that John was at least halfway towards being very drunk. There was a pinkness in his cheeks and he was leaning heavily on the bar. The man, on the contrary, seemed a fair bit soberer, but clearly very interested in whatever John was saying to him at the moment.
“As riveting as you and Dr. Watson’s pending bedroom activities are...Mr. Holmes,” the female officer said, her ballpoint pen at the ready. “The reason for the phone call has to do with the matter of a faux torso in Dr. Watson’s carry-on bag. Perhaps you’d be able to shed some light on it?”
He had solved crimes for years without the aid of chemical diversion, but there was a factor that hadn’t been present back then.
this season." He said coolly, then looked to Sherlock for guidance. "I'd rather not have my throat slit tonight. Is it necessary for him to be here?"
“Jesus hell, you scared me,” he sighs, his index and middle fingers on the side of my neck. Checking my pulse like — oh right, he
“I…” Sherlock began, but his throat was too dry to continue. John placed his hand onto Sherlock’s closest thigh and kept it there.
When it came to scents, Sherlock was an expert. There were at least six different articles on important scents on The Science of Deduction, and he prided himself on being able to identify a brand of perfume within six seconds of being close to an individual. Mrs Hudson wore a muted floral perfume on a day to day basis, and Sherlock could tell when she was visiting Mr Chatterjee down the road because she would apply a small spray of the Marc Jacobs perfume her sister had bought her along her neckline. Mycroft often wore Ralph Lauren, a tradition he had inherited from their Father, and Lestrade rarely wore anything at all. Instead, he could be identified by the constant aroma of slightly burnt coffee and the deodorant he liberally used.
John could come right now from the way Sherlock looks underneath him. Dark curls splashed all over the light blue linens and pale skin glistening with sweat and arousal that John Watson caused. The cheekbones that John cherishes striking in the low light of Sherlock’s bedroom.
Something feels off; there’s a deep feeling of discomfort in his chest, but Sherlock can’t place his finger on what it is. He focuses his mind, trying to deduce what’s different, but he is interrupted by an unfamiliar voice.
Stacking the papers into a pile is a mistake. John goes most of the afternoon without noticing the carefully placed folders and papers, but finally, a few minutes before they are due to leave, John picks up the first piece of paper on the pile. John is making that noise in the back of his throat that means trouble. A small humming sound that he makes when he thinks someone within his vicinity is up to no good.
“Everyone is so nice,” John says, more to the back of Sherlock’s head than anything, but appreciates the soft squeeze Sherlock’s hand gives him in response. It’s evident that Sherlock has a specific place in mind with the way he is narrowing his eyes and looking from one side of the street to the other. John barely cares where they are heading. He’s too enraptured by it all.
“Fear is not a substance,” Sherlock replies. “It's a primitive sentiment created by the brain taking hold of specific chemicals, which elicit emotional responses. Usually to fight or flee.”
“Are you paying attention to what I’m saying at all, John? This is important research into the sporing reactions of—“
“You’ve had plenty of opportunity to do what you were planning for at least the better part of a month by my quick estimation,” Sherlock continues; his voice is still terse, but his face has definitely softened. “And a few...beautiful songs and pride floats and us holding hands out in the afternoon sun gets you all…”
I pull him into my bedroom, and as soon as the door closes, John is all over me. My back hits the smooth wood behind me and his hands are on either side of my head, pinning me into the closed door. His lips are parted, panting slightly, and he leans forward, hovering centimetres above my lips. I whine, wanting him to close the distance, to take me like I’m one of his late-night conquests. My hands find his waist and slide up his back, relishing the feel of lean muscle beneath.
The sex toy was placed sitting up matter-of-factly on the tabletop. The cock directly aimed in John’s general direction, as if pointing out its proper owner. It wasn’t wrong. John’s phone rang out loudly, and only the sex toy on the table didn’t jump at the noise. Who the hell would be calling John now?
“John?” I say, and I wait for him to indicate with a squeeze to my hip that he hears me. “If that what you can do to me during just oral sex, should I just prepare a will now? Save Mycroft some paperwork for later.”
“Stop telling me that. I’m trying. A thousand thoughts are running through my head and I don’t know which of them are real, and I can’t hold onto them long enough to deduce anything. It’s you, you’re standing in the middle of them all, and if you would just move —”
“Dr Watson’s stubbornness has granted you more time, but he is growing exhausted, Sherlock. And so are you.” Irene takes a step out from the shadows towards the bed. The traces of her flirty coyness are no more. In their wake is a stoic expression that belongs more at home in a graveyard. “It’s time for you to make a decision.” she says, sitting at the base of the bed and pulling her phone out of her jacket pocket.
This is him. It really is, and it is better than fine. It’s everything in the stratosphere and beyond. And it feels like every glance in his direction from a stranger isn’t from a stranger anymore. It’s as if they all share a spark that is carried somewhere deep within them that shines so brightly that it causes even their eyes to shimmer with it.
This was becoming a habit. A quiet dance that Greg knew all the steps to, even if the music was the slow funeral dirge or a waltz down memory lane. The seventeen steps up to the flat enough time for him to make sure he had the proper footwear to cut a rug until John demanded that he’d leave.
Molly nodded. “Exactly, it seems like it was done almost...hastily? What do you think?” She asked, but Sherlock’s mind was already roaming onto a more pressing topic. Perhaps Molly would be a good source of information regarding a more everyday issue between John and himself.
“Nothing, you’re just very drunk.” Sherlock slurs, pulling off his coat and scarf as best he can whilst lying down.
Sherlock isn't ready for any of this, and even when he thinks he finally is… he most certainly still isn't.
to do this. That sex is capable of being anything worth bothering with to this degree, and yet it’s everything he was horrified of is now somehow contorted into a pleasing shape. That same shape writhing at each flick of his tongue and whimpering his name.
that we didn’t have a week to wait this out,” John retorts, his eyes flitting over to the taxi driver to make sure that they weren’t being blatantly overheard. “Your coat would be ruined with just a couple of transformations.”
The tea that John made was now cold, but Sherlock drank it anyway. He realised, a bit later than he usual due to his focus on the spreadsheet, that John bought more of the ginger lemon black tea that Sherlock had raved about a few months ago, but didn’t seem available at any of the local shops. Sherlock sighed as he finished off the last few drops, knowing that John clearly had gotten the tea in an apologetic gesture.
That same something inside John’s chest twists again, and the ache helps John to know that he is somehow still standing. Even after hearing all of that.
"It won't be like that. You WILL be able to stop me if need be. Just try to keep that in your mind. That's all. Rule number three on your side of the contract. Are we clear?"
"There's really no way that you will set me free, is there?" She asked hopefully (and desperately) but she knew the answer to that question already.
"You vampires can all piss off. That bastard already took Sophia from me. I'm done with all of you."
"She is almost three years old now but I won't ever let you see her. She'll always have my last name and she'll never know you. She'll always know Benjamin as her father because he was a better father to her than you can ever be." She was angry and at the edge of tears. Jackson looked completely shattered but Sherlock forced himself to remain silent. "You could have just talked to me, you could avoid all this. You could have called, you could even just bloody answer the phone or open the door when I tried to reach out to you. But above all, you should have been there for your daughter. I would have allowed you; I'd really want that actually but after what you did, I don't want you either around myself or around my daughter. You got the one single person in my life and in hers who had shown either of us any kindness killed just because of your arrogance. I knew Benjamin long before I met you, he was like family to me but I don't see the man I used to love in front of me anymore. I don't trust you now, I can't. You are a murderer, how can you be expected to be a good father?"
“And what if I don’t want to move on? He was the best thing to ever happen to me. Without him, well I’m nothing” he swiped angrily at the tears, soaking the sleeve of his jumper.
Suddenly, the sound of gunfire erupted; the heavy relentless drum of machine gun fire, the sharp shattering of glass, the ting-ting-ting of bullets pounding into metal and then the thunderous reverberations of an explosion. John Watson dove behind a low wall, pressing himself flat against the scorching brickwork as his heart threatened to breach his rib cage. Bullets pebbled the ground around him, throwing up clouds of dust. He pulled his gun to readiness, trying to steady his breathing even as the adrenaline burned through his veins drawing him to action. He glanced around himself evaluating the situation, swift and calculating, looking for his men who had scattered at the assault. It was clear that the field hospital was being targeted. He swore vehemently under his breath; the hospital was open and largely undefended where men had poured out to assist in unloading as the supply convoy had pulled up, only a few moments ago. A flash of movement some way in front of him suddenly caught his eye, a blur of foreign material, and John raised his gun and pulled the trigger. And the bullet hurtled towards it destination, destruction spattering in its wake. He barked an order to his men and then the air became dense with smoke and dust, cracking and hissing around them.
I finally did it! It took a bit longer than I expected, I've been finding it quite difficult to write the last couple of days and I was ill over the weekend :(  Still, it is now finished!
Sherlock fidgeted restlessly, his mind was whirring, on the edge of unravelling. His senses were fraught and overloaded. The mindless chatter amongst the sounds of work and the flashing of the police lights; he was finding it oppressive, bearing down on him. He was drawn back to the present moment at the sound of his name and realised that Lestrade had been talking to him, well berating him judging by his expression.
Sherlock regarded him for a moment. He stood up and offered his hand to John, who took it carefully and pulled himself to standing, next to Sherlock.
John’s eyes snapped to mine “You do? God, we have been right idiots haven’t we?” John murmured. I froze, my mind rapidly shuffling through the possibilities, dismantling and deducing.
“What else do you know about me, then,” John blurted out, before he could stop himself. He was intrigued. And, he admitted, his interest had been well and truly sparked by this mysterious stranger. The man began speaking almost immediately;
John had been having these nightmares as long as Sherlock had known him. It was obvious that they were related to his time in Afghanistan but John did not want to talk about them. He had deterred Sherlock when he had brought them up, initially more curiosity than concern in those first few tentative days of their acquaintance. He had made it clear that he did not want to discuss it and Sherlock had, reluctantly, acquiesced. But the nightmares had worsened. Night after night, John was torn from sleep panting and screaming, fear coming alive on his lips. It was starting to wear on him, whether he admitted it or not. He was sluggish and worn out during the day, using caffeine as a crutch, drinking copious amounts of tea just to stay awake. The bags under his eyes darkened with each passing day; deep purple-grey bruises etched into his skin.
They still had so much that they needed to talk about but here and now, side by side and hand in hand time seemed to still, the promise of things to come hanging in the air around them.
Sherlock froze waiting in the silence that had knotted itself between them. Their unspoken confessions from last night seemed distant, ethereal and dream like. John nodded to himself, a decisive jerk of his head, and cleared his throat. The moment was slipping away from them. He had to say something, had to take Sherlock by the hand and lead them the rest of the way from friends to lovers. He reached out with his other hand until his fingertips brushed against Sherlock’s cheek, feather-light.
Sherlock smiled up at him “The name is Sherlock Holmes.” He turned to the cab driver “and the address, 221B Baker street”
John raised his eyes from where he had been staring at Sherlock’s hand on his arm. Sherlock’s eyes were so full of emotion; of confusion, wariness, a little fear but also realisation, affection. It was all written there and Sherlock was letting John read it.
“John, stop--stop” he paused, trying to capture his breath. “I want to kiss you.” His voice was even lower than normal, thickened with lust, desire weaving its way through the deep baritone. It stirred something in John as he clambered up the bed throwing his leg over Sherlock’s hip as he took his mouth. He pressed Sherlock’s lips apart and slipped his tongue in, rough and wet and possessive. He reached down taking himself in hand, stroking himself as his tongue danced against Sherlock’s, pleading and insistent. He pulled himself on top of Sherlock, straddling his thighs as he reached out blindly for Sherlock’s hand, pulling it down until Sherlock’s fingers were pressed against John’s cock. He stifled a moan as he pressed closer, feeling the familiar stirring in his stomach. Sherlock hummed and adjusted his position slightly, then he wrapped his fingers around both of their cocks, holding them together, trapped in his fist. John grunted, the feeling of Sherlock’s hard length against his own threatened to throw him over the edge right then and there. He opened his eyes, lids heavy. Sherlock was in a similar state of crisis, his jaw clenched, his brow knitted together, his eyes squeezed shut, a look of concentration hovering across his features. John watched as he took a few deep breaths, his nostrils flaring with the effort of holding on. Then he opened his eyes; silver irises, pupils blown so wide, feral and hungry. John shivered under the gaze of Sherlock’s lust, pinned down by it as he began to move his fist. John closed his eyes, letting his head fall forward into Sherlock’s shoulder, but Sherlock’s fingers knotted in his hair tugging him away until they were face to face once again. John saw the first signs of pleasure flit across Sherlock’s face, his lips pressing together, his eyes slipping closed for a moment before he captured John’s gaze again. His breath hitched in his throat, his fingers stuttering in their movement. He leant forward to press a soft kiss to John’s lips. The pressure increased against their cocks and Sherlock moaned against John’s mouth. It was that that finally tipped John over the edge. Sherlock’s voice swept through him, hollowing him out then filling him up again, white noise crashing through his head. He reached up to cup Sherlock’s face in his hands, fighting the urge to let his eyes close as he came undone. Sherlock didn’t last much longer, tensing and trembling as he split open, spiralling out of control, his eyes bearing into John’s as they clouded with pleasure. And they clung onto each other as they fell.
“It’s fine” John muttered, gripping the handle of the dustpan and brush he had fetched so tightly his knuckles turned white.
“We’re in London, in a coffee shop. We’re safe.” Sherlock repeated, holding John’s gaze. John nodded slowly.
“I enjoy reading and I get bored easily,” the stranger shrugged, dismissively. “And you play rugby. Isn’t that extra-curricular?” he leant forward, resting his elbows on the table, his fingers steepled under his chin. He raised his eyes to John’s, scrutinising him silently.
He couldn’t see anything. He needed to move, needed a better vantage point. How many men were they against? John didn’t know, but it was clear that they were outnumbered. This wasn’t a random attack, this had been planned, he realised. John took his chance when it came, sprinting across the open ground, gun gripped tight in white fingers, feet slamming into the dirt.  Time seemed to disintegrate in the chaos. Fragments of eerie calm were punctuated by the sharp crack of gunfire and the shouts and screams of men, wrenched from reluctant throats, crashed and collided mid-air. John’s gun vibrated in his hands. Another explosion sounded its victory, and another and another. He glanced behind him. The hospital was now on fire, the flames devouring and hungry. John froze; his stomach lurched sickeningly, threatening to revolt, but only for a moment before being replaced by a white hot, searing anger. That was when it happened. He stumbled back as pressure exploded across his chest and shoulder. His hand flew up instinctively and he startled at the wetness he found there, staring stupidly at the redness on his fingertips. Then his vision whited out as pain ignited within him, every nerve straining and screaming against the intrusion. He shouted out, pressing his hand to the wound as it burned, radiating out. He blinked quickly, swallowing down the nausea, scrabbling to re-establish the mask of calm that the bullet had knocked loose. Breathe! He had to breathe. And keep going. He needed to keep going, keep fighting.
This was Sherlock's way of appreciating and respecting Lestrade and his dedication to his work and Joan knew him well enough to notice it. She'd never seen him talk about anyone like that. He usually just called them stupid or moron and ignored them but he clearly considered Lestrade an exception. She found herself feeling happy about their collaboration.
He shrugged, "Well, the window is already locked and too high up to reach. I'll handcuff you to that bed and then lock the door from the outside. I don't think it will be very comfortable for you to sleep like that though." He paused but received no answer. "So? What is it going to be?"
"Alright then," he inhaled, "Sit down. You may feel a little dizzy but don't panic." Joan did as she was told and he closed the last bit of distance between them by taking another step.
"Good. My name is Sherlock Holmes and as you now know, I'm a vampire," he began, backing away with a grin and putting a safe distance between their bodies once again.
Sebastian looked up as Sherlock stepped into the sight. He certainly wasn't expecting to be caught at that moment but it was as if he had seen it coming eventually. Two of Venenum's people grabbed him and restrained him.
Mycroft's mind wasn't completely at ease about his brother's health; he knew very well that starvation doesn't agree with vampires. As Sherlock had mentioned, blood made vampires more vicious, but starvation made them mad which was exactly why Mycroft worried about his brother.
"Vampires have existed for a very long time. In the old days; when they'd write a contract or any written form of a promise or a deal, they'd sign it with a drop of their own blood as a gesture of good faith."
"Of course I'm sure, Mycroft. There's no doubt about it," Sherlock said, careful to keep his voice down.
London is full of art, history and centuries-old secrets. The human citizens of this mysterious city often tend to automatically assume that vampires are fictional creatures, made up for fantasy novels and TV shows for the sole purpose of their entertainment...
"Look, I have to say something to you and it may destroy our friendship but you deserve to know it nonetheless."
Before I can say anything more, he throws his phone away. I shout as loud as I can but he doesn't even look at me.
It's snowing when he shows up at my door. For a second I think I'm hallucinating him, but I'm not. He reaches out and holds my arm. He's real and he's as surprised as I am. I want to punch him and hug him in equal measure.
"It doesn't bother me too much so I don't mind," he shrugged. They both refocused on the photos. Joan was wondering what she was to do with the photos but Sherlock already knew that so he continued; "You've been in the army and you're a doctor. What do you do first when you find a dead body?"
For the first time in a very long time, Sherlock felt stifled in his own flat; as if there was simply not enough air in the room and his lungs struggled to get some oxygen into his body; his skin was buring with a fever like it'd been set on fire and the silence of the flat was weighing heavily on him.
Once they were back in Baker street, Joan could tell that he was upset; and it wasn't difficult for her to find the cause. She sighed and began to speak in a gentle voice; "I'm sorry, Sherlock.  You told me to let you do the talking and I didn't listen. I was impulsive and reckless and I shouldn't have jumped in-"
"She might never be. We need to talk her if we are to solve this case at all," he replied before sitting across from Joan, "Take a seat, Miss Miller."
"Not exactly. I'm just saying it's probable, that there's a good chance which we must consider. Nothing less, nothing more."
This answer confused her even more. How could a vampire consider solving crime as 'having fun'? "Why are you taking cold cases, Sherlock? Shouldn't you be working on the vampire homicides case?"
1: The companion isn't under any circumstances allowed to expose the existence of vampires in any way or any time to any human.
His head turned towards her and his lips moved, he seemed to be trying to speak but then lost his consciousness and fell on the ground.
“I can’t trust you unless you allow me to do my job which is helping people and saving lives. I could be useful to the case, more so than if I was locked up in here. And I can’t trust anyone who would prioritise locking me up like some common criminal over helping others. So now the real question is, do you really want me to trust you?"
I hug him and cry onto his chest. He's hesitant for a second but then holds me tight. "Don't leave again... ever."
"All I need is why you were killing vampires and what is that you were looking for and then you'll be convicted by Venenum for life. This is the end for you, Sebastian. I suggest you cooperate."
She nodded, "I'll do my best. It's a long shot though. He's unreasonably attached and loyal to Moriarty but it never hurts to try."
A few minutes later, as Joan forced herself to finish the soup, she could hear voices coming from downstairs. It attracted her attention and she tried to focus on it.
They met Sophia in the old building which Venenum owned. Sophia was pale and scared and her hands which were holding a small child shook visibly.
"Bit weird but ok. Although I don't get it, if I've helped you as you say, why did you kidnap me and still hold me captive? It's a little impolite, don't you think?"
"No. Which means whoever's doing this is not stupid. They knew exactly what they were doing. The victims know the killer. They let their killer into the crime scenes themselves."
"Alright, I'm ready," she said and he turned around to look at her. This time, there was something different in his gaze, something that she couldn't quite put her finger on. His eyes had changed colour; now they reminded Joan of sunset at a seaside; calm, deep and inviting. For the first time, she didn't find any fear in herself when she looked at him.
They stood face to face, their eyes locked as the moonlight shone on them through the window. "Joan, I… I can't do this. You don't know what you're asking of me."
Sherlock's footsteps echoed through the narrow corridor of the old building as he made his way to the big hall. It was old but beautiful, like a museum. Gold and white colours could be seen almost everywhere and all the furniture were at least fifty plus years old. Most likely, the place had been the office of someone very important in the past (possibly an ambassador or a secretary or someone of similar authority?), judging by how elegantly it had been built. However the beauty of the building didn't interest him in the least, nor did its history.
"Is it normal for companions to have relationships and get engaged while being a companion?" Joan asked Sherlock in a whisper. Vampires seemed to be possessive creatures as far as she knew.
He was tall and pale skinned with black curls but she couldn't waste more time to notice anything further about his physical features.
Sherlock started to explain everything he knew about the vampires who'd been murdered by poison. Joan listened in silence and Oleander's interest was obviously piqued.
Joan felt her entire body freeze with fear and go numb. "Sherlock..." She looked up at him, hoping he'd let her go back to the flat.
"I understand. I really do. And Sherlock will find this murderer. You just spend time with your daughter until this whole thing is solved. Ok?"
"The fact that we're even talking about this... that you're seriously considering this is ridiculous."
"You can both call me Sophia," she answered with a low and trembling voice as she sat, "I've come to you for advice."
Again one of my favourite chapters. 🥰 Joan and Sherlock start to unravel the mystery of the murders.
"When you came into my life, I was so alone. I'd been to war, seen horrible things and I was desperately trying to fit into a civilian life but I couldn't. I wanted to end it all... then you came along and did the impossible. I owe you so much. You changed me, made me a better man. And then when you 'died'... well you already know all about it now."
Next year, we get married with a small ceremony. Neither of us cares for big celebrations anyway. I've managed to have a small snowflake engraved into the inside of Sherlock's ring a week before. When I'm about to slip it onto his finger, he notices it and looks at me but waits until the quests are gone to ask me about it.
"You're not hunted by the war, Doctor Watson- you miss it," he said and turned to leave but when he reached the doorstep, he shot her another glance,"Welcome back."
“They normally tell me to piss off. Turns out people don’t generally like strangers knowing their business.”
Lestrade stared at him for a moment longer, perhaps sensing the quiet desperation in Sherlock’s eyes. He glanced again at John, then back at Sherlock. He nodded quickly.
“Stop John, please STOP!” I snapped at him, my vision blurring at the edges, I felt dizzy. And sick. Oh my god, I was going to throw up.
John swallowed thickly, wresting himself to his feet. He needed to stay focused. He moved from person to person, checking for a pulse, for heaving breaths, for something he could save, for anything he could save. Anything! He stopped and looked around at the carnage scattered around him; the blood drenched soil, the tangle of bodies, the fire reaching to consume the sky. He had not saved anybody. And he was still here to bear witness to that. He looked to the sky and screamed. He screamed out his fear and pain and sadness and guilt and when he was done he fell to his knees empty and broken.
Sherlock hovered in the doorway, his fingers twitching nervously against the handle, the cool of the metal anchoring him to the spot. This felt like an invasion of privacy. John Watson was an exceptionally proud man. He ruled himself with a rigid, unwavering control during the day, rivalling even Sherlock’s forceful detachment from emotional experience. But now, at night, while sleep held him tight in its unrelenting grasp, he was at the complete mercy of demons that tore at him and ravaged him in his dreams. Sherlock edged forward, his heart pounding against his rib cage and his bare feet sliding rough over the carpet. John looked so small. The bed clothes twisted around him as he writhed about beneath them, the duvet clenched tightly between his fingers. His skin was slick with sweat and his cheeks were dampened by tears. He moaned out his anguish once again, his eyes squeezed shut, jaw clenched and Sherlock swallowed thickly as he stepped into the room.
