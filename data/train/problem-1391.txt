“Sherlock? Can I come in? Please?” John still sounded so hatefully careful. Sherlock said nothing and wished for his evaporation harder.
“Very scared.” Sherlock nodded. “I loved your dad more than anyone else in the world but didn’t believe he could love me back. I did a lot of silly things because of that. We both did.”
“You really know how to kill the mood,” she said as she wrinkled her nose in distaste. Jane chuckled and kissed the tip of Sherlock’s nose.
He couldn’t concentrate on the book in front of him, the study of maggots suddenly becoming unspeakably dull and meaningless. Restless, Sherlock got up to find something more interesting to do in the living room. He glanced at John’s armchair as he walked past it, and the sight of John’s cardigan thrown over the back of it made him stop.
The events of last night’s painkiller disaster came back to Sherlock in a rush and he felt his cheeks darken with guilt. John ruffled his hair and laughed.
Sherlock gnawed on his bottom lip as he considered all the possible scenarios. Too many variables to take into account, the end result was unpredictable.
“M’not mad.” John curled around Sherlock’s legs and mumbled something indistinguishable to his ankles. Sherlock couldn’t help but smile.
With that, Jane let go of Sherlock and stepped back. Sherlock wobbled precariously before finding her balance again. Her pupils were dilated, a soft blush spreading across her cheeks and neck, nipples peaked beneath her t-shirt. Jane look at her hungrily and licked her lips.
He could feel himself harden at the thought, and he wondered whether he could get away with snatching John’s cardigan for a bit, just long enough to firmly imprint the scent from it into his mind palace while he rutted against the bed with two fingers up his arse. John’s smell surrounding him, he could pretend it was John fingering him slowly to completion.
Sherlock repositioned his hands to cradle John’s head. He brushed his thumbs across John’s jawline, relishing the slight catch of stubble beneath his fingertips. Sherlock pulled away from the kiss only to pepper small, light ones all over John’s lips. John hummed and let himself be covered in Sherlock’s affection.
Sherlock stepped closer to John’s armchair, hand never leaving the cardigan. He ran his fingers across the luxurious material, entranced by its softness and deep blue colour. The fact that it belonged to John, that he had kept it for so many years and clearly took good care of it, made his heart soar. He could convince himself touching the cardigan was almost like touching John himself.
Sherlock marched towards the end of the corridor, where he could see the main computer interface, all the while looking for any trace of John or a body. Each deserted room made his panic rise. What if he was too late? What if Mycroft’s information was wrong? What if—
John settled on the other side of Darcy, on his side, facing both of them. He shuffled in close so he could soothe her too, rubbing her back and sides.
In the meantime, Sherlock let Mrs Hudson fuss over him, not paying attention to what she said or what kind of food she put in front of him. Mostly, she let him be.
Sherlock glanced guiltily towards the bathroom door, as if John could sense what he was about to do. But no, John was still happily and obliviously showering.
John told Sherlock, with bitterness and anger in his voice, how he was demoted and decommissioned, put to sleep until a decision was made whether to take him apart or redesign him anew.
A few hours later, as the sun rose across the city, Sherlock was still awake. He had spent the night lying motionless on the sofa, caught in an endless loop of regret and hopeful waiting for John to call back.
“No, Sherlock. Sherlock, wait,” John said quickly, before Sherlock managed to roll away and leave the bed. He grabbed Sherlock’s arm and tugged him back. “I didn’t mean it that way.”
Sherlock sucked in a startled breath, his mouth falling open. Watson. Watson’s voice. He had a voice. He was calling him. He was speaking to him. Watson
Once his eyes adjusted to the dark Sherlock could see John’s silhouette. He could see his profile as he talked, and he fancied he could see the starlight reflected in his eyes which were as dark as the night sky. Sherlock knew, with the kind of unshakeable faith he rarely experienced in his life, that throughout the entire history of the universe, cosmic stardust had never and would never coalesce into a being more perfect than John Watson.
“I think I know a story like that,” John said, pretending to ponder it deeply. He scratched his chin thoughtfully. “I know one about a really bad and evil dragon, and about a prince and a knight who fell in love, and then defeated him. Do you know that one, Sherlock?”
“I picked up some junk parts at the last port we were in,” John explained with a small smile. “I think they belonged to a survey ship because there were loads of data logs about— well, it doesn’t matter really but I found something about your planet. From before— from before. When it was there.”
things were different, more fragile. John had only just come back to live with him at Baker Street, and Sherlock reasoned it was too soon to indulge himself again, no matter how much he wanted to and how much he ached for John.
Then John hitched up his leg and pushed his thigh against Sherlock’s cock, and all thoughts of escaping fled Sherlock’s mind. It was bliss. John muscular thigh pressed hard enough to provide blessed relief, and Sherlock couldn’t help but thrust his hips just a little. It had been days since Sherlock had masturbated and he desperately needed a release after the case.
Jane heard Sherlock get up as she started to brush her teeth.  Sherlock walked into the bathroom, yawning so hard Jane could see her tonsils, less than a minute later. Jane continued brushing her teeth and watched with mild amusement as Sherlock navigated the short walk from the door to the loo.
“You know, having parents that love you to bits is not as bad as you make it sound.” John squeezed Sherlock’s waist one last time before stepping away and grabbing his bag. Sherlock followed suit and rang the doorbell. Sounds of great excitement and commotion could be heard from inside, followed by hurried footsteps towards the front door. Sherlock couldn’t suppress an eye roll while John just grinned.
After two hours he gathered all the papers and burned them in the fireplace. He pocketed the pass given to him by Mycroft and ran downstairs to find the promised car waiting for him.
In the kitchen they were greeted with Mrs Holmes up to her elbows in pastry and what looked like a flour explosion all over the kitchen table.
He was about to give up, and send Mycroft a note on how to improve MI6 security just to rile him up, when one entry caught his eye.
Sherlock tucked his face into John’s neck and breathed in. He wanted to preserve this fragile moment, keep it safe in his mind palace to cherish later. John’s skin smelled fresh and clean, the scent of soap almost overpowering John’s natural one. Sherlock followed it without thinking, until he found his nose and mouth pressed to the skin behind John’s ear, where his smell was the strongest.
Sherlock could feel the rough scrape of stubble against his skin, John’s breath warming his cheeks, John’s hand caressing and tangling in his hair. Sherlock was grateful they were already on the bed because even those two simple kisses made his knees weak.
Sherlock walked over to the sofa and picked up the DVD case that had been carelessly thrown on it. A new James Bond film, clearly a gift from Harry. Sherlock smiled to himself, remembering all the other Bond films he had watched with John over the years. Back then, it was an opportunity to bicker and laugh with a friend, even if he had longed for more. As much as he protested and moaned about the stupidity of the films, he cherished those evenings and carefully stored every single one in his mind palace.
The room was completely dark, like the endless darkness of space, but for the one bright spot in the middle. As Sherlock got closer, they walked past several planets they recognised to be part of the Solar System. The planets weren’t much bigger than their head, travelling slowly along their own orbits. The Sun, dimmed as not to damage eyes, shone warmly in the middle.
“I woke up an old AI, so what? Nobody was using him—” Sherlock snapped his mouth shut, but it was too late.
“Yes,” John answered, glancing over at Sherlock. John’s expression was soft and tender, and it made Sherlock’s chest ache to see it even after so many years. “The knight fell in love with the prince when they met. He thought the prince was beautiful, smart and funny. He couldn’t believe how lucky he was when the prince became his friend and asked him to live in the castle. The prince made him very happy.”
“You have made me happier than I could ever imagine being. And I love you more than I have ever loved anyone. I want to spend my life with you.” Jane used her thumbs to wipe away the silent tears escaping Sherlock’s eyes. “I know this isn’t much but—”
Shimmying closer to John had been a perfectly effective strategy so far, so Sherlock wiggled against John again, trying to plaster himself completely against John’s side. There was no space between their bodies, and Sherlock hoped his incessant wiggling would provoke John to stop him by touching him.
Sherlock peered down at the little cherub face staring at him pleadingly. He has never been able to say no to her, from the moment he first saw her as a newborn baby just over three years ago. The love was instant, all consuming, and more than a little bit scary. From the moment Darcy opened her eyes and looked at him—even though logically he knew a newborn couldn’t really see properly—he knew he would move heaven and earth to keep her safe and happy.
Clearly the bundle was significant and relevant to what had happened earlier. Sherlock took a closer look at it, still puzzled, and opened his mouth to ask John what he meant by this when he realised.
to the imagination. Sherlock couldn’t help cataloguing John’s penis size, something he’d been fantasising about for years, and he felt his face flush. John was impressive. Huge, even. Bigger than Sherlock’s already generous estimations. It made Sherlock’s mouth water.
Mycroft heaved another sigh, tapping the end of his umbrella against the wooden floor. When he spoke again, his voice was gentle, as was his gaze.
John rubs the sleep out his eyes and slowly rolls out of bed, grimly accepting another sleepless night ahead of him. He glances at the bedside clock; it cheerfully displays 2.30 in the morning. He walks to the window and opens it fully. He takes a deep, calming breath and braces himself for another late night argument with his flatmate.
“Given the information and reports we have received to date, I propose to terminate Watson with immediate effect.”
Sherlock woke up feeling groggy and a bit sore. Return to full consciousness was slow, not at all helped by how warm and comfortable he felt. It was only when he tried to bury himself deeper under the covers for a few more minutes of sleep that he realised his sleeping position had changed somewhat during the night.
“Don’t know,” John said and shrugged. He looked down at his feet, somewhat sheepishly. “I just thought it’d be nice to have a night in. With a movie. A bit like a date. Since we haven’t had any.”
“Hello, Mrs Holmes,” John placed a kiss on her other cheek and gave her a hug, not caring a whit about the flour.
“Told you the movie was boring,” Sherlock mumbled. He rubbed the sleep out of his eyes, dispelling the last of the sleepy fuzziness. “The ridiculous—”
Sherlock had been awake for two hours by the time John made it downstairs. John entered the kitchen yawning, absentmindedly rubbing his belly with one hand. He took the fresh coffee Sherlock gently nudged towards him on the kitchen table—coffee which Sherlock had made as soon as he heard John was up—with a grateful grunt.
With a sigh of relief, Sherlock opened the single accessible folder. Instead of documents, as one might expect from an archive, it only contained a single file. Or rather, an ancient looking software shortcut icon.
Sherlock had taken a case, a quick and boring thing barely above a five, to show John how he worked. He solved it quicker with John there with him, and it ended with a bit of light sprinting across Regent’s Park. It had been utterly brilliant.
"I'm really sorry, officers, my flatmate sleepwalks sometimes," John smiles apologetically and carefully takes out the violin and the bow out of Sherlock's hands. "I'm a doctor, I can take care of him."
He was considering whether to distract himself with his experiments or go bother Molly at Bart’s, not wanting to mope around the flat in case Mrs Hudson cornered him, when his comm device signalled an incoming call.
Not satisfied with the intensity of the smell, Sherlock buried his nose in the collar of the cardigan and inhaled again. The feel of the wool against his face and John’s scent was almost overpowering, and Sherlock couldn’t stop a small whimper escaping his lips. The cardigan smelled like John’s soap and shampoo and fabric softener, his aftershave and deodorant and cologne, hints of tea and coffee and Indian food he had throughout the day; but beneath it all was the unmistakable musk of sweat and
“Now, where were we?” John half-growled out as he pulled Sherlock towards him. He reached down to pull Sherlock’s leg over his own and grabbed his arse. Sherlock’s delighted gasp was lost in John’s mouth.
John turned on his heel and disappeared into the bathroom. Sherlock had to fight the urge to get up and go into his room to observe him through the glass bathroom door.
They had two days, if Mycroft was correct, and he almost always was. Two days was far too short something truly meaningful, but Sherlock would take anything, anything at all, to banish the self imposed loneliness. Two days of happiness were better than nothing.
Sherlock looked around the room, considering his options. There was only one, albeit fairly sizeable, bed. There was also the armchair but it looked tiny and fragile. Sherlock could just not sleep; he could stay awake and organise the conclusion of the case inside his mind palace, he could watch John sleep and catalogue his sleeping pattern. He could do all that even though he was exhausted to the bone.
“Don’t worry about it. We have time to catch up.” John winked at him and Sherlock felt himself blush. Something in his belly fluttered pleasantly at the thought of what that would bring. He did, however, also feel a little bit nervous at the prospect of a relationship, and all that entailed, with John. Because it was John, and he couldn’t afford to lose him again.
“John!” Sherlock pounded on the glass separating them. He knew it was ridiculous to shout, the man in the tank couldn’t hear him and he wasn’t John. Not yet, anyway.
Sherlock was nearly incandescent with happiness, having found someone who listened to him and found him interesting. He felt like he might float above ground, if he were to try to walk.
Sherlock’s brain ground to a halt. The Earth stopped moving. The Sun stopped going round the Moon, or was it the Moon going round something else; gravity failed, all the laws of physics were irrevocably broken. Sherlock felt he was disintegrating and collapsing in on himself at once, his body ceased to exist and his immaterial form was tethered to reality only by John’s words.
He pressed his forehead against the warm metal, trying in vain to imagine it was the warmth of a human body.
Lestrade shrugged. The rest of the police officers were getting ready to leave. “Nobody died, Sherlock only insulted one person, and I’ll get to watch the game tonight. A good night, in my opinion.”
Somewhere ahead there was the person he was looking for. A shadow, a silhouette in the darkness. The shape disappeared, along with the maze and the lights and the cables, as he surfaced from his dream.
Sherlock glanced at the empty spot beside him, and idly wondered how long it would take John to calm their daughter down, or whether he would be coming back to bed at all. Darcy was terrified of thunder and it took enormous effort to talk her down from the near panic she inevitably worked herself into. Quite often it took long enough for the storm to pass and she would fall into an exhausted sleep. Other times the storm was too powerful and too long, and her fear too great, and either John or Sherlock had to stay with her for the night.
A software prompt popped up, at the same time as his own computer alerted him it had to optimise its own processes to be compatible with such an outdated system.
Sherlock scrunched his nose in distaste and continued his search for food. “I’m not a dashing knight in shining armour, slaying dragons and saving damsels in distress.”
He knew John wasn’t completely safe just yet, and he didn’t know whether the transfer had been a success, but the immediate physical dangers were now over. John was stable, all he needed now was rest to recuperate.
Sherlock felt content. The only way he could’ve been any happier was if John sat next to him. If John were human. As it was, he soaked up whatever happiness he still could.
“Mmm, no,” Jane replied. She planted one last kiss under Sherlock’s jaw, and gave her breasts one last gentle squeeze. “But it’s a good start, isn’t it?”
John’s consciousness had been put into a state of hibernation, only accessible through a direct link. Which meant he was somewhere nearby. Sherlock took in his surroundings once more, his eyes immediately landing on the black monoliths on the other side of the corridor. Now that he wasn’t dashing about, he could see tightly coiled cables and wires filling the gaps between them. As he got closer he could see a few blinking lights. It reminded him of something, but he couldn’t quite place what it was.
The halls and walkways of the ship were quiet. The lights were dimmed and the only sound was the faint humming of the engines. Sherlock clicked impatiently as they strode down the hall. They had looked for John in all the usual places but they had yet to locate him.
Sherlock groaned as he blinked his eyes open. The world outside was bathed dark, and the only light inside the flat came from the soft white glow of the computer display.
“I’m not, but I will not let you starve, either.” Mrs Hudson ushered Sherlock into his seat, and glared at him until he started eating. “I know you haven’t had anything to eat since the biscuits yesterday—and do not think I haven’t noticed you nicked them, young man—and God knows when was the last decent meal you’d had before that.”
“Sherlock,” John said his name with so much love Sherlock felt his throat constrict and his eyes sting. John leaned in kissed the corner of Sherlock’s mouth, his thumbs gently caressing Sherlock’s cheekbones. “I love you,” he whispered into Sherlock’s mouth, and even after hearing it countless times it still made Sherlock breathless with happiness and wonder.
After he arrived at 221b with two six packs of beer, Lestrade was greeted with piping hot Chinese food and the game already on the telly. John was getting the plates and cutlery out, while Sherlock sat perched on his armchair, pointedly not looking at the football match.
Sherlock got up from the sofa with John’s help, and they both shuffled slowly into their bedroom. Once there, John helped Sherlock undress and get into his pyjamas. He tucked Sherlock in before taking care of his own clothes.
“You’re incredible. I can’t believe—” John paused to brush away the curls that had fallen on Sherlock’s face. “It’s been so long,” he said simply, and Sherlock didn’t need any more to understand all that was left unsaid.
A few days later John stays behind at work to help out a colleague. It’s just as well, really, as he doesn’t particularly want to go out into the pouring rain, having left his umbrella at home. Almost an hour after his shift ends he finally ventures outside and nearly bumps into Sherlock when exiting the building.
John, still trembling and breathing unevenly, eyed the glass with suspicion before snatching it and downing the whole thing in three big gulps. In the back of his mind, Sherlock was relieved to see John conscious and without any immediate physical impairments.
Mr Holmes’ idle and pleasant chatter washed over them both as they were ushered into the house and the sitting room. Even though it was almost unbearably hot outside, the house was cool. The windows were wide open, a light breeze making the curtains sway gently. The breeze brought in the smell of flowers growing in the front garden and the soft buzzing of bees.
“This folder is the only record of Phase II of the Watson AI,” Mycroft continued as if Sherlock hadn't spoken. “After the failed Maiwand mission, the MOD decommissioned Watson and stopped the progress of Phase II, making sure all physical files were destroyed and digital copies were heavily encrypted, as you yourself discovered. However, certain...
“I thought you treated me like an equal, when no one else did.” John’s quiet and angry words cut Sherlock to the bone.
One side of Sherlock’s mouth curled up in a lopsided smile. John kissed that corner of his mouth gently, and stepped away.
Sherlock assumed one of the icons along the top of the screen enabled online access. The icons were cryptic and opened a vast number of menus and functionalities with vague names composed of acronyms and numbers. It took a minute for Sherlock to get his bearings, which didn’t escape Watson.
“I’m so sorry,” Sherlock said, voice breaking. “I was only trying—I wanted you to be happy until the end. I thought if you did, and if I was the one to—I didn’t want you to be sad. I thought I could be your friend, because neither of us—”
Sherlock heard John’s heavy and tired steps on the stairs a few minutes later. He smiled to himself and kept reading.
Sherlock leaned back into Jane’s embrace, still brushing her teeth, although her movements slowed considerably as Jane’s wandering hands got closer to her breasts. Jane nuzzled the side of Sherlock’s neck, planting kisses along her path. The kisses grew longer and wetter, until Jane reached Sherlock’s earlobe and sucked it lightly. Her hands, having finally reached Sherlock’s breasts, cupped them lightly.
Sherlock entered the flat quietly, not wanting to betray his presence just yet. He carefully draped his coat on one of the living room chairs, and took a closer look at the transformed flat. The coffee table had been pushed away from the sofa, the tv now sitting atop it, surrounded by small candles. More candles were scattered around the desk, a random array of various sizes and colours, some evidently pinched from Mrs Hudson. The only other sources of light were a lamp on the other side of the room, behind Sherlock’s armchair, and the lit fireplace. The flat felt warm, cosy and intimate. Romantic, even.
“Do you need help with the pastry?” John said, deftly steered the conversation back to neutral ground. Sherlock busied himself with poking around the various bowls of ingredients assembled on the kitchen table and occasionally nibbling on something sweet.
Sherlock monitored John’s vitals while the stasis tank was drained of the translucent medium the body had been kept in. He couldn’t help but briefly catalogue John’s physical features—strong jaw, compact frame, broad shoulders, narrow hips, average height, dark blonde and silver hair—as if he were meeting the man for the first time. In a way, he was.
“Yes,” Darcy agreed, nodding firmly more to herself than anyone else. “The prince was smart so he knew and then the brave knight kissed him.”
“He is,” he murmured into Darcy’s hair and kissed the top of her head. “And if any more dragons appear, we will take care of them.”
“If that’s o—yes, of course it is. There’s another bedroom upstairs, you can take that. Or we can swap!” Sherlock blurted out when John frowned up at him. “It’s fine, you can take mine, whichever suits you. I really don’t min—”
John hummed into the kiss and slowed it gradually, ending it with a few final light pecks to the corners of Sherlock’s mouth and then the tip of his nose.
“I’m sorry, I didn’t know the whole time, I couldn’t do anything about it, they—I don’t—John, please—”
“Yeah,” Lestrade smiled. Greasy take away, alcohol and football sounded like the perfect end to a pretty good day. “Sherlock won’t mind?”
“Don’t thank me yet, you might wake up with a hangover tomorrow,” John chuckled. They bid their goodbyes and Lestrade fell asleep almost immediately.
“That’s surprisingly tasty,” John says after eating his first spoonful of the blue concoction. Sherlock twirls his spoon idly and says nothing. They eat the rest of the food in silence.
Most importantly, his personality and his character were intact. It was as close to a miracle as Sherlock would ever admit.
“Yes, John, don’t interrupt,” Sherlock said, clearly trying to hide his immense amusement. His mock annoyed glare looked identical to Darcy’s, and John chuckled at how much alike the two of them looked.
Sherlock sat in bed, reading glasses perched on his nose, reading a book about bee social structures. A storm raged outside, thick raindrops rattling against the windows and thunder vibrating through the walls. It felt bizarrely peaceful like this, even with the noise of a summer thunderstorm wreaking havoc outside, sitting dry and content in bed, safe in the knowledge it would all be over by morning.
Sherlock stayed awake, watching both her and John in the pale light coming through the curtains. He could see Darcy’s frizzy hair sticking out in all directions, the tip of her button nose, and her small fist still hanging onto John’s t-shirt. She looked tiny and fragile, like the smallest touch could break her. Sherlock’s chest tightened at the thought. He promised he would protect her, a vow he made to himself when he first held her, and the one he just made to her. The thought of failing to keep her safe plagued him—had plagued him for over three years. Could he keep that promise? What if the next threat, the next dragon, was too big even for them? What if—
“That was the most ridiculous thing I have ever done!” John voice filled Sherlock’s ear, and then dissolved into high pitched giggles.
“Alright, alright.” John snuggled up to Darcy and gave her a kiss on the cheek in apology. Mollified, Darcy turned to Sherlock.
John tried to pull Sherlock even closer but broke away from their kiss groaning and wincing in pain.
He settled more comfortably on the couch. He should get up soon and go back home but the prospect of more sleep was quite tempting. The affectionate scene made him feel strangely content with the world at large and he wanted to bask just a little bit more in the warmth of 221b. Lestrade knew that next time he saw Sherlock the man would know what he witnessed, there was no way the detective wouldn’t notice. Whatever the consequences, Lestrade was now bound to keep the secret and he would do it gladly. Smiling to himself, he turned his back to the room and fell asleep within moments.
John swept his thumb across Sherlock’s cheek, and met his eyes. Something like recognition lit up his features for the first time.
“John said you can come in.” Molly’s voice startled Sherlock. “He said he’s surprised it took you this long to find him.” Molly’s voice sounded suspiciously smug.
“Yes,” Sherlock agreed quickly, before John had a chance to flee the kitchen. John looked at him with a hopeful smile, and Sherlock’s chest flooded with warmth.
John’s gentle fingers at his elbow started a yelp out of him. Sherlock whirled around to see John looking confused and worried. Also completely dressed. Sherlock couldn’t stop the rising panic overtaking his mind. How long had John been standing there? Had he heard him? What had he seen?  Everything?
“I love you,” Sherlock whispered again, voice growing thick with emotion. John gathered him close and kissed him, and Sherlock kept whispering it over and over again between kisses. The words had been stuck in his throat for years, and now that he’d said them once they poured out of him endlessly.
Sherlock glanced at John, who had a slightly melancholy look on his face. Neither of them had mentioned the time before they met in a long while, certainly not to Darcy.
“Hmm,” John hummed as he tangled his fingers in Sherlock’s hair once again. Sherlock suspected it was something he’d been wanting to do for some time, and was pleased to find he loved it when John did it. “We’ll figure it out.”
Sherlock’s orgasm hit him unexpectedly, a near shout escaping his lips. He tensed and shuddered above John, back bowed, his cock spurting over John’s fist. John stroked him through it, his touch growing lighter and gentler until  it stopped when Sherlock shivered with oversensitivity. Sherlock kept whimpering and moaning softly, still trembling with the intensity of his orgasm. He couldn’t think, couldn’t speak, he could barely muster up the strength to keep himself propped up and not collapse on top of John.
John cut Sherlock’s tirade short by kissing him gently. Sherlock tried to glare at him but John’s fond look and smile were too infectious, and he felt his own lips twitch in response.
Sherlock nuzzled the soft material, holding it up with both hands so that it covered the lower half of his face. He moved his nose along the collar, following the scent to where it was the strongest under the armpit.
“With your track record of getting into trouble I would assume you’d be the one in need of rescuing,” John smirks, not looking up from his food. “But the sentiment is appreciated.”
It’s a Sunday, they don’t have a case and London is trying to drown itself in rain. Neither John nor Sherlock bother with changing out of their pyjamas and dressing gowns, and spend most of the day sitting on the sofa and watching telly.
Getting into the folder took some effort, but once inside Sherlock was confronted with several subfolders, each harder to crack. Interest piqued—why go to such great lengths to protect some archived data no one even accessed anymore—Sherlock set about getting as much information from the protected archives as he could.
Sherlock maneuvered them towards his car, evading the resident paramedics. The entire site was being evacuated, which suited them perfectly. Sherlock bundled John into the car, making sure he was secure and still breathing, and then sped off towards London without looking back. Baskerville’s grey buildings were lost in the fog behind them.
Sherlock slowly sat up and swung his legs off the bed. John sat back on his heels and looked up at him, as if in supplication over this sentimental theft. Sherlock looked down at the scarf bundled up in his lap and tried to fight the lump in his throat.
“How considerate of you,” Sherlock replied, his usual confidence slowly coming back as the shock of hearing Watson’s voice receded. He grasped for a change in topic, to distract himself from his fluttering stomach and downright boyish excitement, and blurted out the first thing on his mind. “What does Watson stand for?”
Sherlock had no idea how to respond without accidentally hyperventilating so he tilted his face up and closed his eyes.
“Petty theft and politics,” Sherlock replied around his mug of coffee. He turned his focus back to the book on forensic entomology.
The ring was simple—a thin, white gold band with a round, flat, white and blue gemstone in the middle. Sherlock lifted her other hand to trace the ring with her fingertips.
Then there were the reports detailing the AI transfer tests, all of which had failed to some degree. Some had been complete failures, killing the host body in the process. Some had been partially successful, but impaired the body to such degree they were in vegetative state or comatose. Others still had been successful in preserving the health of the body, but the AI transfer had been minimal and insufficient.
Sherlock refused to acknowledge John by opening his eyes, instead remained a tightly curled ball of shame and guilt. He heard John kneel by his bed.
Sherlock remembered these types of screens and messages from the outdated computers at school, but they had been ancient by computer standards, even back then. The software was licensed for 2020-2024, which made sense considering the last logged entry into these files was on 7th August 2024. Nearly thirty one years ago.
“Daddy didn’t kiss you straight away?” Darcy was genuinely puzzled. She looked between John and Sherlock, waiting for one of them to explain.
Sherlock had clearly struck a nerve; Watson sounded defensive. They had a personality, could swear like a true soldier but was holding back, and had entertained sexual thoughts. Sherlock could’ve clapped his hands in glee.
Jane got up from the bed and stretched, rising up on her tiptoes. She padded to the bathroom and used the loo. She washed her face and tried to brush out the knots in her short hair but it was no use, at least not until she washed it.
They fell into comfortable silence after that, John and Mrs Holmes also having finished their conversation. The four of them sat watching the clear night sky and the stars falling for a little while.
“Likewise, but call me Greg or Lestrade, everyone does. This are my second and third in command, Molly Hooper and Sally Donovan.”
James Herondale: Son of Will Herondale and Tessa Grey/Herondale/Carstairs, alive on Victorian times. He was half warlock, half Shadowhunter and he had the power of walking through shadows. He was a student at the Shadowhunter Academy when Ragnor Fell was a teacher and he took a particular interest in him, though he didn't actually became a full warlock, basically staying a Shadowhunter.
He lowered his face, and his eyes filled with moisture, and then he felt a tug, and a long-fingered hand grabbed his own. He lifted his face, not letting go, but squeezing the offered hand, locking eyes with Sherlock as the other man started talking.
“You should try it sometime. Miff told me you were very skilled in Transfiguration when you were younger. Earning the praise of Minerva McGonagall was never easy, trust me, I know, she edits everything I publish for Transfiguration Today. She still calls my endeavors at transfiguration in fashion a total waste of time. Showed you mine, now show me yours?”
"Will. It seems your friends finally managed to get their affairs in order. We are sending them away right now. I hope you don't mind; I told them to wait at Baker Street for the pickup. That way you can say a proper goodbye this time."
They chatted a little more about muggles in general. Rolf, growing up in a pureblood family as well as Luna, had little experience with muggle behaviour and found anything about them fascinating. Rolf admitted that he saw the name Sherlock Holmes on a muggle newspaper and told Luna, without knowing the details. He read that the man was a detective, and for him, it was a funny bedtime story for the twins that a muggle detective shared a name with his wife's imaginary friend. He congratulated John on their little girl, while Luna and Sherlock continued to talk, apparently so engrossed with each other that his partner lost track of Mycroft's movements.
The man was talking to a flustered Hermione, who seemed comfortable enough, at least that was what John gathered from her body language. Harry kept looking at the pair of them from afar, prepared to intervene if something unbecoming happened. Of course, nothing of the such would occur in public. Mycroft was a sneaky one indeed. His wife was entertaining Ron, who seemed a little entranced by her beauty and looked like he understood half of what she was saying. Soon, Harry and his wife joined them, and Alissa spoke animatedly with Ginny instead. Harry kept giving her knowing grins; he seemed to know she was buying her husband time alone with Hermione for whatever his plans were. It seemed that whatever it was, it finished soon since Mycroft looked like a cat who got the cream and Hermione seemed equally satisfied.
“My wife is keeping me at home today. I hope you manage to handle this without requiring further assistance.”
“I’m the only Shadowhunter here, which you will clearly find out for yourself if you opened the door. What harm can you expect of little old me? Surely you need to do proper surveillance before sending the rest of my group away. Do hurry up, I’m not getting any younger out here, and I’m not immortal, like some of my companions.”
“Yes, I’m sorry Billie, I don’t know why the TARDIS brought us here. But you know what Grandfather always says, the TARDIS takes you were you need to go. So maybe this place in time is exactly where we are supposed to be. Let me start again. Good evening, my name is Ianto Harkness and this is Bill Smith-Jones. We are both from the future, were you already know my father, mother and grandfather. Bill here, she travels with my grandfather all over time and space. She already knows you both from the future.”
"About that. I think we should consider the offer Mary. It isn't just you anymore. And we now know that we are targets. We also know who is after us, and he is more than dangerous. And he is not your usual run of the mill assassin, not even in your league."
John sighed again. This wasn’t how he expected to spend his night. He wanted the case to be a four or less, so Sherlock would solve it in minutes, and then finally he could get into Sherlock Holmes’s pants.
Victor ran to her, stepping on the dead man’s body on the way, and helped Alissa up from the floor. She patted her belly self consciously, like trying to reassure herself her child was unharmed.
Hopkins called his people off, and soon two dark vans appeared. After they left, Sherlock could see men in dark suits carrying big cases entering the scene. Then, DCI Lestrade appeared, with a sour look on his face, glaring daggers as he walked to Mycroft. His former team, including that no-good Anderson and newly promoted DI Sally Donovan appeared on the scene. They walked straight to the bodies.
This chapter is two days earlier than promised, but since I have to work on Sunday I thought I'd rather play on the safe side.
"She knew what I did for a living now. She might have left some clues on the books if she felt she was a target."
He managed to place a lot of things in his head, mastering the art of saving useful information in a special place in his mind, and erasing useless facts, like the planets in the solar system. Soon drawers started to accumulate, and a simple desk wasn’t enough, he had a special room in his mind for all the facts. Then, when he started his time at the University, learning new things through experimenting every day, even a manor House, like the Holmes state, wasn’t enough. It became a bigger property, like the one his grandmother had in the south of France, where he had spent many summers in his youth. But even that wasn’t enough. Soon he had a Palace in his mind, a Palace as grand as Versailles itself. And in the tower of that palace, all those things only he ever saw, the creatures, the buildings, even something as large as a town he glimpsed once as he was exploring the borders of France. The strange boys with tattoos, which he sometimes saw catching the tube. Other things he saw just a night, strange creatures that seemed threatening even to him. He even saw a ghost once, in his old flat in Montague street.
“Yes, exactly that, yes. We need something else. Do you carry those Peruvian Instant Darkness Powder things, Harry?”
And they both started laughing again. Since Sherlock didn’t react, other than blinking, Victor decided to take pity on his friend, and with a wave of his wand fixed his trousers while changing again. He retrieved his shirt from the floor and did the buttons again before leaving the room, not before he whispered something in Sherlock’s ear that made him scowl and try to slap him on the back of the head. Victor, expecting something like that, just dodged the hit and laughed his way out of the room. As he closed the door, Sherlock’s eyes refocused on John, a somewhat predatory look in his eyes once more.
He knew what came next. He took the paper and a pen from the kitchen table and wrote over the address.
His face was blank at this comment. John didn't know how much he knew about who had shot Sherlock, he suspected, but he was positive Mycroft didn't know for sure, because his wife, baby or not baby, would probably be in a ditch somewhere.
“What you really wanted to say is that you don’t see how I can be of use. But clearly I can use my science in this Shadow World of yours.”
Mycroft rang for Sherry, who soon enough came with the star charts. They took the other end of the table, as Sherlock started to make calculations on them. He logged onto his phone and began a search,and then he placed a tack on a point in the map.
Sherlock’s charm seemed to part the flames, but I wasn’t strong enough to handle the amount of fire they were dealing with. There was no door at the end of the small tunnel of flames. The fire seemed to get brighter, bigger and closer to them. John started sweating, the heat and the smoke almost too much for him now.
Woolsey Scott: Werewolf, alive on Victorian times, first Praetor of the Praetor Lupus, an organization that protects newly born Downworlders, especially werewolves, so that they don't attack on their first changes with the moon and bite people. They also cater to newborn vampires sometimes. In this story he had a fling with John, before turning his attention towards his little brother Magnus.
“Yes. But we can start with this one. I believe we can take this group out, three of them, one is enough. Now, the rest of you, shield charms around the rest of the wall. Tum, as soon as you see me throw it, close the hole. Now.”
“She is an amazing fighter. I’ve read accounts of some battles she fought along with the Iron Sisters. My mother said once she is one of the greatest warriors she has ever met, and she never says that about someone that’s not Nephilim.”
“We decided pairs are the best approach. I will be pairing with Gabrielle, Creevey with Prewett, Trevor, disguised as me, with Alissa, then John and Mr Holmes. Abbott and Rosier will stay back as a backup. Every Auror has a coin linking them to Alissa and me. The rest, use the Patronus charm as means of communication in case something goes outside of what we planned. He won’t be expecting us. We need to capture him alive, don’t cast to kill. However, if anyone’s life is in immediate danger, a killing curse will be condoned. Mind you; I’ve never used it. We’ve captured every killer since I’m in office alive, and we’ve Azkaban full to prove it.”
“I’ve known him for a long time, longer than you John. And you know what I see when he looks at you? Devotion. Hope. Things I haven’t seen on his face in a very long time.”
But the words didn’t really register with him, and his own mind deleted them before he could answer back.
They both turned to look at the new arrivals, and the woman's face lit up lit up like the sky. She smiled and stood from her spot on the desk and walked directly to meet Sherlock with open arms. She was petite but wearing heels, and she came almost to Sherlock's nose in height. She threw herself in his arms and Sherlock received her looking annoyed, but as she was going to kiss him on the lips, Sherlock reclaimed one of his arms and placed his hand in between both of their mouths. She pulled back with a look of betrayal on her face, as he told her,
John felt a pang of guilt, of course, Mummy Holmes would want to meet their daughter. She had been nothing but kind to John and seemed delighted with the new status of their relationship. Victoria entered the room, wearing a beautiful blue dress that highlighted her eyes. Mmm. He thought Victoria favoured green eyes. She kissed John on the cheek and walked over to receive her kiss from Mummy and kissed Sherlock, who swatted her away, like a little kid hiding from a big sibling.
John's ears turned red at that comment. He could very well picture what Mary was imagining. After all, the press, the media, everybody assumed Sherlock and him were more than friends most of the time. He always denied it because having people say it when it was never the truth only made him mad, remembering what he never had. It never stopped, even after he married Mary. She always took it as a joke, but I guess she still doubted if there was any veracity behind the punch line. Mary stood silent for a while near the living room window. She seemed to be pondering the whole situation.
Sherlock witnessed the exchange, and John could see worry escaping through his usual façade. He stood next to him silently and placed his hand on his shoulder. As Sherlock looked back at him, he seemed to relax back into his usual features. Fear might still be there, but now it wasn’t there for those who knew how to read him to see.
“I think you'll find this information helpful.” Mycroft's eyes followed Sherlock's frantic movements.
“Great,” John gave Lestrade a friendly pat on the arm. “Bring the beer,” he said as he started to walk towards the nearest taxi stand.
They finished the rest of their food in relative silence, interrupted only by Sherlock’s groans or exclamations of “Ridiculous!” when Bond did something particularly egregious. John didn’t bother to respond to any of it, bar a few eyerolls and pointed sighs.
John and Sherlock finally relented. All three of them were a little bit breathless from laughing, the covers and pillows strewn around the bed.
Sherlock hugged him back, held him just as tightly, and said nothing about the moisture seeping into his shirt. Relief swept through him like a flood, making his limbs heavy as the exhaustion of the last few days finally caught up to him.
“What’s in it?” John asks. He peers into pot and sniffs the food carefully, his belly rumbling appreciatively.
Sherlock was still unable to talk so he shook his head mutely. How could he make John understand none of this was a real possibility in his mind; how could he make him see how utterly unlikely any of this was?
And sex, more often than not. Oh god, was this supposed to be like one of those dates he had seen his peers go on when he was teenager? All snogging and groping in dark cinemas, followed by quick sexual acts in cinema toilets or the backs of cars.
He could see John moving around the kitchen, making breakfast, in his peripheral vision. John turned his back to him, engrossed in preparing his oatmeal,  and Sherlock let himself smile at the mismatched socks encasing John’s feet. His fingers itched to smooth away John’s unruly hair, and to touch the pillow creases still marring his cheeks. Sherlock wanted to feel the day old stubble beneath his fingers and his lips. He wanted to bury his nose in John’s neck and smell him, the remnants of his shower gel and shampoo, his aftershave, deodorant, sleep sweat and the very essence of John.
“I know what you’re thinking, and you can’t stop it.” Mycroft pressed his lips into a thin line, a clear sign he was debating how much information he could reveal. “There is a major defence AI being developed, the M Project, and it is beyond my power to influence its trajectory. The awakening of Watson is simply a convenient way to speed it along. It is both out of your hands and mine.”
Sherlock felt as if he’d been dunked in ice cold water. There it was. John finally saying what he’d been dreading the most.
The candour startled a laugh out of Sherlock. Clearly, this AI had a distinct personality. His lips twitching at the corners, Sherlock typed out the truth.
“John, darling, stop with this Mrs Holmes nonsense. Call me Margaret, or better yet call me Mum. You are part of the family, as far as Thomas and I are concerned,” Mrs Holmes said with a twinkle in her eyes, ignoring John’s vague noises of protest and Sherlock’s sudden blush.
“The prince fell in love at first sight too. He thought the knight was gorgeous, loyal, brave, strong and also smart. He was amazed the knight wanted to be his friend and spend time with him, and that he listened and cared about him.”
They heaped their plates with curry and rice, grabbed a few beers from the fridge, and made their way back to the living room. John set up the movie while Sherlock fussed with the sofa, fluffing up the pillows.
Sherlock felt his ears heat up. John complimented and praised him so much, so often, like it was a completely natural thing to do.
“A body was developed to house the AI. An organic body.” Mycroft waited for Sherlock to find the relevant pages. “The end goal of Phase III would have been units of soldiers all sharing the Watson AI. Phase II involved tests on individual hosts to perfect the AI transfer, although that has never been perfected. The body is still there, in Baskerville Laboratory. You can still save him.”
my only friend, I didn’t know what else to do,” Sherlock babbled. He felt like the entire world was slipping through his fingers and he couldn’t stop it. “I wanted to spare you the grief. I’m sorry, I know I was wrong, I was selfish and I’m sorry.”
“Hello, little bee,” he said softly. He caressed her hair and back, trying to soothe and calm her down, as she clung to him.
“Sherlock,” John says as he holds up his hand. He carefully puts the violin and bow down on the kitchen table and doesn’t look up at Sherlock as he continues. “Not interested in whatever experiment you were conducting this time.”
Sherlock stood by the desk a few moments longer, trying to calm his hammering heart. They were fine. They would be fine. They would stay together and it would all be fine.
“No, that’s all I needed.” Sherlock strode off in the direction of the hologram suite. They berated themselves for not checking it earlier. They knew John had been spending a lot of his time in there lately.
It was the cardigan John had worn the previous day, one which Sherlock was very familiar with as he had bought it for John himself as a birthday gift a few years prior. Sherlock reached out to touch it with his fingertips—merino wool and cashmere blend, dark blue, size medium, made in New Zealand.
They exchanged closed mouth kisses for some time, straying to kiss cheeks, chins, eyes and even necks. This was their morning ritual on days when there wasn’t a case and they could fully indulge in each other.
“Careful or you won’t get your birthday present,” Jane murmured into Sherlock’s neck, before kissing it. Her hands caressed Sherlock’s abdomen, still flat and hard but for the delicate softness around her hipbones.
Sherlock tried mirroring John’s actions and opened his mouth a little further. John groaned and pulled Sherlock closer to him. Emboldened, Sherlock gave John’s lower lip a tentative lick.
“221b Baker Street. Consulting detective. Genius. Dashing knight. Has an annoying older brother,” John recited, still cupping Sherlock’s face, his own face transforming into a smile.
Just as Sherlock was about to type out some sort of greeting or an opening question, the newly awakened AI beat him to it.
“If I didn’t know any better, I’d say you were a hopeless romantic,” John murmured, affectionate amusement in his voice.
“I hope you appreciate the sacrifices made on my part,” Sherlock said by way of greeting, not even looking at the door. His knees were drawn up to his chest and his arms circled loosely around them, making him look like a disgruntled owl.
“They’re in my coat,” Sherlock huffed out, affronted. John smacked a wet kiss on Sherlock’s cheek and got out of bed giggling. He grabbed the pills from Sherlock’s coat and broke one in half.
Within a few minutes Sherlock was at the door of the hologram suite. They raised their hand to open the door but hesitated at the last moment. What if John was using it for personal matters? Was this interruption acceptable according to human manners? Sherlock clicked in frustration and lowered their hand.
They both giggled, high on the adrenaline and endorphins. Sherlock took the ring out of the box and handed it to Jane. Jane slipped it on Sherlock’s ring finger of her left hand, and then placed a kiss over it. When she looked up at Sherlock her eyes were filled with tears, ready to spill.
Sherlock hummed in response and closed his eyes. He listened to Darcy and John breathing softly, and let himself drift away, surrounded by his family. He dreamt of princes, knights, dragons and brave princesses.
Sherlock woke up from his cosmic crisis to John shaking him vigorously. He took in gulps of air—when did he stop breathing—blinking away his dried out eyes. The shock of oxygen finally entering his lungs made him dizzy.
Sherlock dried John with the towels he had prepared, and set about clothing him in one of the many laboratory coveralls strewn around the place. As he was zipping up the front of John’s clothes, the vitals monitor started shrieking, and John’s regular, deep breaths turned into gasps. John was going into cardiac arrest.
“Not taking any risks,” he said by way of explanation and went into the loo for a cup of water. When he walked back out Sherlock was confronted with the fact that John was as affected by their activities as he was, the evidence of this perfectly outlined by John’s boxer briefs. Sherlock couldn’t tear his gaze away until John crawled back into bed.
“Gentlemen,” he interrupted the discussion at the table, the gathered officers falling silent almost instantly. “We have the final Maiwand report. The situation is rather more serious than we first thought.”
Sherlock was cut off by the firm press of John’s lips against his. The kiss was chaste and brief, a simple peck. Far too chaste and far too brief, in Sherlock’s opinion.
“Hmpf,” Sherlock huffed. Lestrade heard toast being eaten and dared to open one eye slightly. John was standing right next to Sherlock, his hip brushing Sherlock’s shoulder. He was sipping his coffee with a faraway smile on his face, looking somewhere through the window. His other hand was in Sherlock’s hair, running his fingers through the detective’s curls. Sherlock leaned into the touch and continued to chew on his toast thoughtfully.
John told Sherlock of the first time he became conscious, of the day he was “born”; how he was briefed on his mission and inducted into the army; how he developed a conscience, a personality and humanity far beyond what his creators intended; how they attempted to purge him of emotional responses, but failed. He told him of his first mission in Afghanistan, in Maiwand, where he lead and commanded real soldiers on a routine patrol; how the soldiers were ambushed and John observed helplessly as they were all slaughtered; how the mission failed, leaving him a sole survivor.
“I like it,” Sherlock blurted, and found he meant it. John looked up at him with a hopeful smile playing on his lips. “It’s, um, it’s—it’s romantic.”
“We will get to the dragon soon enough.” Sherlock laughed and continued with the story. “They became close friends quickly, and soon after the prince insisted the knight come to live with him in the castle. He made the knight his personal guard so they could spend as much time together as possible. Everyone knew it was just a formality, that the two men were friends, but they were so happy the prince smiled and laughed again so they let it be.”
Jane looked down at the sleeping limpet in her arms, smiling softly and brushing the hair out of Sherlock’s face. She kissed her forehead gently and lingered there, stealing a few more moments of peaceful bliss.
The AI stopped abruptly, as if in stunned silence. Even though they had been communicating via text, Sherlock could feel a sudden tension in the air.
He disabled all the alarm systems in the main computer, and turned off the ventilation system keeping the hardware from overheating. He overloaded all of the electrical equipment in one of the rooms, making sure to arrange it all around the oxygen tanks and vents.
tension rests on romantic love, which is not so interesting. I prefer the idea that the human will shapes one’s personality. Perhaps it is a maturation of Wagner’s thoughts. The emphasis on Mitleid might even be considered an answer to the Sehnen of
, but he looks at me, and he lets me reach for him and trace his brows and the shells of his ears and admire his remarkable familiarity. "Me too," he says, and I don’t believe it at all. "I hated marrying Mary," he tells me, like it is his greatest secret. "Even though I loved her, I knew I did not love her well. But she forgave me, before she passed, for loving you since the very beginning."
“Sherlock.” He speaks in a sing song voice, the tone strangely unsettling. His smile widens as he looms over Sherlock. “It’s time for your session with Miss Adler. What do you say you come with me?”
The rest of the session was pretty uneventful after she gave up trying to get me to talk about my personal life. But, her prying did result in us going overtime, and by the time I stepped out of her office it was time for dinner.
I’m unsure of whether I should be intrigued or oddly offended, and I consider storming off, but the part of my brain that wants desperately to know how he knows takes over, forcing me to reply. “Afghanistan. How did you-”
I slowly take his hand and he pulls me up like it’s nothing. He looks me over one more time, assessing my physical state. His eyes linger on the insides of my arms, and I quickly cross them over my chest. He takes the hint and lets it go, shifting the books in his arms again.
So now here I am, lying on an uncomfortable mattress and wondering how and when I’ll get to talk to the other man again. My roommate shifts in his bed and I hold my breath, but after a few seconds he goes silent again, his breathing still even. I exhale and try to return back to my thoughts, but before I can drift away again, a muffled scream rises up from another room. It’s not an uncommon occurrence in this place, but it’s still unnerving every time it happens.
God, what are you even supposed to do in this place? Wait around staring at the wall until you go even crazier? Watch the same rerun of looney toons for the tenth time in a row? Sounds like fun.
He shakes his head slightly and scrunches his nose, as if reminding himself that there is a situation to handle. At the same time, I realize that I’m still sitting on the floor, staring up at him like an idiot. I find myself glad that we’re in a place where this silent staring match is the least strange thing anyone will see today, resulting in everyone largely ignoring the whole event.
I stare at the ceiling of my room, my roommate’s soft snores lulling me into a sort of trance as I think about my interaction with the strange dark-haired man the previous day.
He sighs heavily, leaning his head back against the wall behind him. “Doctors upped my dosage. Said I needed more after last night.”
“The way that you hold yourself says military. Your face is slightly more tanned than the rest of your body, but there’s no tan above the wrist. So you spent a good portion of your life abroad, but not sunbathing.” He pauses, clearing his throat in what I now know to be an apologetic gesture. “You’ve got scars on your arms and wrists, the angles of which suggest that they are self-inflicted and the thicker vertical lines indicate a suicide attempt. That plus the fact that you’re here indicates that you endured something traumatic in your past. You’ve got no close friends or family, so they can’t be the cause. Posture, suntan, traumatic event in the last five years – Afghanistan or Iraq.”
He clears his throat, straightening himself and turning his face into a mask of indifference. The sudden change in demeanor throws me for a loop. “Actually they uh…they put me in here because I’m a paranoid schizophrenic.”
My eyes land on a measly shelf of books in the corner of the room. Exhaling sharply, I stand and begin to make my way towards it.
I look up and run my hands through my hair, cringing at the greasy feeling on my fingers. I try to recall the last time I showered, but I quickly give up, sighing and looking around at the poor bastards who have been forced to share this hell hole with me. The people who have been labeled “crazy” all their lives. The people who have been told that being shoved in here will fix them.
He raises an eyebrow. “How very eloquent of you Watson.” He glances down at the books in his arms. “Well, I should be getting back to my work. I only have so long before my next session.” He nods at me before whisking away gracefully, leaving me to wonder what work he could be referring to. “So long Watson.”
He doesn’t acknowledge me as I approach him, which worries me deeply. I sit down in front of him, effectively blocking his view of the rest of the room, but he still doesn’t react. I exhale sharply and wave my hand in front of his face. “Sherlock?”
I tell myself not to jump ahead; I don’t have all the information. But I don’t think I’ll be getting said information out of Sherlock, not while he’s like this.
He sighs heavily. “Paranoid Schizophrenia. A chronic mental disorder which involves symptoms such as auditory and visual hallucinations, delusions, anxiety –”
He’s still staring at me through his drug-fueled haze, and I find myself unable to look away. We stay locked in this strange staring contest until the orderlies announce that breakfast is over, effectively breaking the spell. One of the orderlies, a shorter man with dark, slicked-back hair and an unsettling smile begins walking toward us. Jim Moriarty. I haven’t seen much of him since I’ve been here, but what I have seen hasn’t given me a good feeling about the man. He reminds me of a shark; always circling the grounds, searching for someone to accost. He continues over, ignoring my threatening glare in favor of eyeing Sherlock like prey. My stare just turns more deadly when Sherlock whimpers and lowers his head as the man gets closer.
The next morning, I walk into the cafeteria in a daze, the measly two hours of sleep last night not doing anything for my mental state. I take my meds out of a little paper cup, and I sit down, picking at the sad breakfast in front of me.
After a few minutes of more screaming and crashing and what sounded like a head banging against the wall, the ward goes silent. Then the footsteps can be heard again, this time moving slower and in the opposite direction as before. I close my eyes and try to ignore what just happened. I try to forget where I am for just a moment, and after about an hour of silence, I finally drift off into a restless sleep.
He hums, opening his eyes and lifting his head from the wall. His eyes meet mine, and the glazed-over look makes me want to find the nurse who ordered the increase in dosage and make sure they’re never heard from again. No one with a mind like Sherlock’s should be forced into a practically drug-induced coma.
I look around, scanning the room for sharp eyes and a mop of dark hair, and just when I’m about to give up hope, I see him sitting in the corner, staring out at the crowd before him. Though something about him is different this time. His eyes are lacking that spark that they held on that first day, instead just glossy and unfocused. He’s just staring off into space, not really seeing anyone or anything. This makes me frown, and I look around to see if any nurses are watching me before standing and making my way toward him.
"I suppose," Watson says, looking stupefied by my sudden passion for the topic after my long insisted upon reluctance. "That it is about the renouncing of desires, the search for inner peace through will." He thinks for a minute as I restuff my pipe. "But perhaps, Holmes, the answer is easier. Did Wagner not eventually marry his long-term mistress? That might have influenced his writing."
"Please," I say, "if you have ever listened to me - ever tried to trust me, know this. I have loved you since the very beginning, John."
"He hurt himself," Watson explains, looking concerned. He holds his finger on the page to mark where I interrupted him. "It was not the sorceress Kundry that caused his injury, it was his own failure to resist her. Klingsor is able to use the spear on Amfortas, causing his wound, because Amfortas did not resist. Don’t you see? It is not just Klingsor who hurt his own masculinity, even if King Amfortas did not go so far as to castrate himself deliberately."
"Oh Watson," I say, my voice revealing how I might laugh. "I could not begin to presume to understand your mind." He laughs at me then, and I realise the truth of what I have said only after already speaking. But I do not take it back.
"His impulses, the manly masculine spear. The wound that wouldn’t heal. Yes, all that." I’m bored of it, and I stand up to fetch my violin. I play the motifs I remember from the opera, and think about the reading Watson has done with my back to him.
"But – " he stammers. "King Arthur. This is like saying you do not need to understand German, or that the enjoyment of
"Could I – come back? I have been staying here occasionally, and there is a buyer for my practice, but he wants the rooms above it also." He pauses and I look around my room, how it is messy but has been kept clean, by what I am now beginning to suspect was a joint effort on the part of Watson and Mrs Hudson. "It has been rather empty since – well. Mary."
, the front reads. I smile at him. He has brought me several books about these stories of medieval England, and I have read not one of them. I should feel worse about the rudeness of my lack of appreciation for his generosity, but I am hoping for something else.
He laughs, and it is almost too much to bear, the intimacy of our rooms, the light of the candles. "I don’t think it’s simply the rejection. I should say it is about enforcing will, and compassion."
He does forgive me, before I even ask it of him, and I tell him I need him for a case instead of crying at his feet with gratitude. So he helps me, and we unravel the last thread together.
It takes every inch of self-control I have not to crow with victory, but I think he suspects this is what I have been angling for. I take care to look away from him until I can suppress my smile however. It wouldn’t do for him to know.
Only as I look at the shore, do I let myself imagine what it might be like to be on the other side of this channel. What if the situations had been reversed? I hold no illusions as to the nature of Watson’s, or indeed my own, affections, but I never doubted that I was a dear friend to him. I had frequently been forced to remind myself that I might never return, but now that I am returning, with only one thing left to do, I imagine how it would feel to have Watson returned to me after presuming him to be dead, and I reel at the thought. I decide then that I must find a way to show Watson that I had to be gone this long, that there was no other way but the one I had chosen to achieve what I must, that I had constantly considered him and his happiness. So that I might earn his forgiveness.
It begins – as it often has between Dr Watson and myself – with a visit to the opera. Usually we find ourselves in high spirits afterwards, eager to talk of themes and artistic intent, and in Watson’s case, endless concerns for other works that are similar. It is after a splendid performance of Wagner’s
"I do not like this," I complain; it has been hours of endless rambling about the divine spear and chalice, that reunification of the whole, split apart into the feminine and masculine. And anyway, if it’s supposed to be about the feminine evils: "Why was it the spear then that wounded the king? Should it not be a chalice-inflicted wound?"
"No, no," I laugh, even as I hear my own lungs rattle with the effort, "I have far greater sins than those!" He looks to be in pain, and so I urge him to take some laudanum. He shakes his head no and I try to sit up to make him, and then my dream changes.
He must register the look on my face for he pats my hand, and seems to be about to tell me we can leave when the door opens. "What?" asks an angry German voice, discordant with the neatly arranged hair, daintily painted lips. Watson puts her at ease with the sequence he must have learned this morning, and we are invited in. He looks back at me, and I nudge him forward. No one could recognise us here.
"Like this insistence on denying temptation, and perhaps even your insistence that your transport is irrelevant." He looks angry now and I cannot tell if he is talking about the case, or
He chuckles then, half-away in thought. "A bit queer, is it not? The wounded manhood as a punishment for giving in to temptation, the purity of Parsifal that is shown mostly in his not-wanting. The pain it causes him to be with a woman?"
We are not making much progress with the original poem, but when I turn around to tell Watson I wish to take a break and read something else, he has his eyes closed. His mouth is slack the way it only is when he has fallen asleep on the sofa, or sometimes right before I wake him for a case. I play on, thinking about resisting temptation all the while.
He stutters to a halt. "Downstairs, at the reception," he tells me, and I know he speaks the truth. "The man at the reception talked to me about places we might go. Did you miss me?"
"For the lyricism?" I ask, and we end up having a rather inspired conversation about music. Watson of course cannot follow it for the most part, but when I turn to him to ask if he preferred we changed the topic, his eyes are brimming with something I fear to examine. I let him be content listening, after that.
He scoffs at me, but takes my temperature, and cools my brow, and feeds me sips of weak broth until I beg to be left alone after no more than half a cup. "Truly alone?" he asks, standing up with some hesitation that I am too weak to deduce the cause of.
"It seems," I muse, much later, "that too often men rely on women to resolve – to realign their souls."
"It’ll take longer," I remind him, "we could take the ferry from Holland and arrive a day earlier at least."
"It’s unsafe," he says. "We cannot risk life and liberty, and besides we are drunk. It would be better if we were to sleep now, so we might take the train tomorrow."
One evening, when we have just finished dinner and are sitting in Watson’s study, them on the sofa, me on the chair in front of his fire, he brings it up.
"What of this twice in a lifetime chance, then?" Watson asks, very carefully, when we are walking through the park. We have finished our latest case, and have taken up our habit of reading the original story again. If he wants to talk about Parsifal, I will indulge him. "To – to get into the king’s forest." Adolescence and middle-age as two portals to finding the place where the Holy Grail is kept.
Sherlock drifted in and out of consciousness while John undressed, cocooned in bed and feeling full to the brim with love. His final thought before drifting off was that, even though their movie nights still contained all the familiar elements from before, they were now far more worthy of storing in the mind palace, romance and all.
Mycroft pressed his lips into a thin line and frowned. He looked down at his shoes and tapped his umbrella against the floor.
Mycroft was right. Caring was not an advantage. He let himself slip this once, and already it had turned into misery.
John reached over and ran his fingers through the hair at Sherlock’s temple. His fingers lingered, his thumb trailing down across Sherlock’s cheekbone to his lips. Sherlock’s gave John’s finger a quick peck.
Now that John was safe, Sherlock could catalogue his physical appearance in more detail. John looked to be around thirty-six, give or take a year or two since no records of his “birth” had been kept. He was shorter than Sherlock but broader, more compact. He had lost a lot of muscle mass due to prolonged stasis but Sherlock imagined John could get fit quickly if he put his mind to it. He had dark blonde hair, streaked with silver and grey. His eyes, big and dark blue, were mesmerising. As were the laugh lines around his mouth whenever he smiled. His habit of licking his lips, however, was wholly distracting.
“I wasn’t finished!” John yelled. Sherlock closed his mouth with a click. “Why bother telling me I will be fucking dead in two days if you could have some fun, hmm? Take the old cripple out for a spin, have a laugh, and then once he’s gone, just keep going on with your life.
Sherlock’s belly flipped and he felt his face heat up. Such a simple touch, but it could melt Sherlock’s bones.
Sherlock felt his own blush creeping up neck and cheeks, setting his entire face aflame. John’s grin grew even wider.
“Go to bed, Sherlock,” John sighs. Sherlock turns on his heel and stomps into his bedroom, slamming the door behind him. He doesn’t speak to John for two days.
Sherlock returned to John, picked him up at gently as he could, and carried him to the lifts. He set John down on the floor, arranging him in the recovery position. He checked his heart function and breathing again, twice, to make sure he was stable. He quickly assessed John’s body temperature by laying his hand on John’s forehead, and told himself caressing John’s skin and hair was part of the process.
Jane giggled and kissed Sherlock’s frown away, before getting up and walking to the wardrobe. She rooted at the bottom of it until she found the right shoebox, all the while being aware Sherlock was most likely ogling her arse as she did so. A quick glance at the bed confirmed that Sherlock, now sat up, was staring shamelessly.
“Oh!” Mrs Hudson interrupted, flapping her hands with excitement. “Oh Sherlock, I’m so happy you finally found a young man for yourself.”
Slowly, the storm became less intense and violent, thunder rolling occasionally across the city in the distance, almost drowned out by the sound of heavy rain.
“It’s you,” he whispered as he touched the exterior of the server bank. He could hear a faint humming, the vibrations of it carrying through the metal casing into his palm. “John.”
John moved his head again and slotted Sherlock’s lower lip between his own. He sucked on it lightly, while at the same time tugging on Sherlock’s hair, and Sherlock was powerless to stop the tiny moan tearing itself free from his throat. His cock, which had deflated significantly during their conversation, regained interest in the proceedings.
Sherlock had turned around in his sleep and was now facing John. His face was mashed into John’s neck, his left arm slung over John’s hips, and their legs tangled under the covers. John had both of his arms around Sherlock, and he had his nose more or less buried in Sherlock’s hair.
“And good evening to you too, Sherlock,” Lestrade replied unfazed, and carried on walking towards the kitchen. Sherlock scowled and turned his attention towards the telly. Lestrade got out two beers for himself and John, and deposited the rest in the fridge. They carried out the food into the lounge and sat down on the sofa. Lestrade tucked into his food and couldn’t hold back a groan of pleasure. It was his favourite and it was delicious.
“This isn’t a joke, brother dear. You do any more than you have done already, and you could find yourself in a position where even I can’t help.”
“No, you’re your own person. You’re you. John Watson, formerly of Fifth Northumberland Fusiliers. A soldier, now also a doctor,” Sherlock teased him lightly and was pleased to hear John huff out a laugh. “You’re—” Sherlock hesitated. “You’re my friend.”
“Mmm, terribly,” John said with a smirk. He pulled away a bit, looking up at Sherlock with a slightly uncertain expression. “You don’t think this is too much?”
, when they used to live together, Sherlock would often make use of the frosted glass door connecting his bedroom and the bathroom. Whenever he had heard John go in, he’d abandon whatever he had been doing and quietly slip into his room. There was a chair opposite the ensuite door, placed perfectly for surreptitious observation, where Sherlock would watch John undress. The frosted glass made everything blurry but just having the tantalising hints of John’s naked body sent Sherlock’s heart racing. He took in every detail of John’s broad shoulders and narrow hips, the thickness of his thighs, and his gaze hungrily focused on John’s groin, trying to tease out the shape of John’s cock from the blur.
One of the giant blocks had a small plaque on it, and Sherlock approached, already knowing what it would say.
She glanced at the bedside table in search of a clock. It was just past nine, an entirely respectable and appropriate time to get up on a Tuesday.
Sherlock pouted as the screen announced his entry into the archives, giving him a list of items to explore. He had been hoping for a decent distraction, something to occupy him for a few hours, maybe even a day, but alas no such luck. Sherlock scrolled through the various folders and subfolders and sub-subfolders lazily, exploring a few subsets to see if there was anything worth his attention.
Both John and Sherlock fell silent at the question. How do you describe Moriarty to a toddler without scaring the wits out of her? How much of his true evil do you include? How do you simplify someone who had nearly cost them everything they held dear, including their lives? What started out as a made up fairy tale suddenly had the potential to become too serious too quickly. Sherlock shuddered to think about telling their daughter even a tenth of what Moriarty had been and what he had done.
“You do realise the Perseid meteor shower happens once a year on exactly the same date,” Sherlock raised his eyebrows at John. “It’s in no way more or less special than last year’s or the next, in fact--”
“I’m sorry,” Sherlock blurted out. “I should have woken you up earlier. I know this wasn’t good, I didn’t mean to—this is nothing, this is just a natural reaction to the proximity of another body. Dreams mean nothing, there are multiple variables influencing—”
All of that in of itself was a pretty alarming thing to wake up to. What was most disturbing, however, was the very prominent and frankly impressive erection John was rubbing gently into Sherlock’s abdomen, as well as Sherlock’s own hard cock pressed against John’s thigh.
That wasn’t what Sherlock expected John to say but he gave no indication of his surprise, and remained still. He heard John enter the room somewhat hesitantly and close the door. John walked around the bed to the side Sherlock was on, still so soft and gentle as if Sherlock was an easily spooked animal.
His still heart pounding loudly in his ears and a layer of sweat forming at his hairline, Sherlock monitored the progress of the transfer and John’s vitals. The process seemed to take forever, and he paced the small room in agitation. He was terrified it wouldn’t work, that the strain on John’s body would be too great and he’d die, that they’d be caught trying to escape. If he were a religious man, he would pray, but as it was all he could do was hope he managed everything in his power to save John, and that the universe was kind to him, for once.
—is this your birthday present?” Sherlock sounded surprisingly eloquent with a toothbrush hanging from her mouth.
They entered the room; a four poster king sized bed with deep green curtains that looked so welcoming, John almost fell asleep just from looking at it. Sherlock frowned at the curtains, and with a flick of his wand, he changed the colour to scarlet.
They moved in sync, really a sight to behold, working in tandem like a well-oiled machine. They encountered at least 50 more people, and John felt for every one of the muggles that were snared by Moran to form his army of corpses.
. I’m going to talk to Percy about a Portkey right now. We’ll have to talk to Harry to arrange a team, and we need to contact MACUSA for permission. I’ll handle the details.”
He chuckled a little and John could see he was enjoying telling this story; he was enjoying talking about his family history, letting John in after all this time. His eyes were bright, and he looked like he was retelling a particularly interesting cold case instead of facts about himself.
Victoria appeared through the door. She seemed hesitant, like waiting for further permission. She stayed in the doorway rather than walking in; no doubt thinking interruption would not be acceptable.
"You were a beater on your house team. Protective instincts, violent behaviour? A match made in heaven."
“Jealous Johnny, I was wondering when he was going to grace us with his presence again. Welcome back, old friend, I really missed you. Well, not, but still. I’d rather have jealous Miff aimed at me than bother the man who is currently keeping me alive. So I’ll shut up. For now, at least.”
“The problem with quills. Pointy tips. They ruin the wood on tables. Mummy always insisted on us to use muggle pencils on the holidays or do homework anywhere that wasn’t a wooden surface. Mind, she bought her children wooden desks for school, so the point was moot.”
“Just let me know if you need any help with that, mate, I’m sure Riegan would make a nice sculpture somewhere.”
"What are you doing? That woman was evidently misjudging for something your sister did, blaming you when not everything is on your shoulders. For example, Harry cheating and her being an anal retentive workaholic don't lead back to you."
“Shadowhunter, warlock, old friends. Anna died a long time ago, Tessa is still around, she is married to a former…well, a special kind of Shadowhunter.”
"I think this year could be our year; we have two new chasers that bring what the team was lacking."
"My mind playing tricks on me. My brain has been tampered with, sometimes with magic, as you could see from the effect Mycroft's spell has on me. I've seen this information myself in my mind palace countless of time, and I refuse for it to be real when it simply is."
“Well, that sounds… amusing. But we need to get back to the matter at hand. It seems someone it’s trying to stir trouble in the London Shadow World. A fairy knight and a Shadowhunter were murdered, and there is a Vampire witness that claims the Shadowhunter murdered the knight inside of Fairie. Clearly someone wants to destabilize the current cold peace agreement, probably by stirring sympathies from other Downworlders to the Fairies and their current plight against Shadowhunters. Clearly if they are not safe on their own realm, no one else is safe from Shadowhunter retaliation and the Accords are a moot point. The fact that the main witness in favor of the fairies is a vampire is suspicious at least. I’ve never had any problem dealing with Emilio before.”
John couldn’t tell now between Sherlock lying through his teeth at Roman or finally admitting things he had been thinking all along. He needed to sort things out between them. But he needed to get them out of the Hospital first.
“Don’t underestimate the love of William Holmes, John. That man is as madly in love with you as you are with him.”
She then grabbed both of his hands, and soon her eyes were once again violet, and Sherlock’s eyes as well. John widened his own eyes. The whole situation was too much. Victor just seemed bored, and Mycroft kept his arm on his wife’s back. They both came out of it at the same time, and Sherlock would have fallen backwards if John hadn’t moved fast enough to catch him. John grabbed Sherlock and pulled him up, his arms under his, then he kept his hands at his back to hold him upright.
“I assume since you already know us, even if we don’t, we can skip the pleasantries. Tell me, when was the last time you saw your father? He is, after all, the one we are supposed to be looking for.”
How this kid was even in this world if his grandparents shared a room with bunk beds was surely a story for another day, and frankly, John was afraid to ask.
“Sorry. Magnus, I’m sorry, young one. I’m not used to the Shadow World anymore. I was happier when all I had to think about was the mundane crime going around in London.”
"The story is almost the same as I told you before, just adding my other brother, who received the letter the same day as his twin. They both were sorted into Slytherin at school and were inseparable. Both of them joined the Ministry, the same department. That is when things went to hell. Do you remember which department had the most number of loyal followers of Voldemort's regime in the war?"
After their brunch, both Sherlock and John left the house in their muggle clothing, deciding to take a cab to the hospital. Sherlock’s ability to summon them out of thin air seemed like it had magic involved somehow.
John didn’t want to think what the brothers were planning behind his back. He contained his anger as well as he could and texted Mycroft. He had a strange relationship with the man. He never forgot the first time he saw him, after he let himself be kidnapped, hoping for a good fight, and instead met a auburn headed man with a long nose, leaning on his umbrella, all bespoke suits and dark gloves.
“I know, but the crime scene we saw today was clearly a Shadow World affair. And he had his paws all over that too. A Shadowhunter was dead, Sherlock, I saw the body and if I’m not mistaken the other body belonged to a Seelie Knight. Which means there’s a big shitload of things going on, because the Shadowhunters are not happy with the fairfolk right now. This could mean war. And I was just starting to get comfortable again.”
“The Patronus charm is a complicated bit of magic, and it reveals a lot about the one who casts it. I just thought he had matured out of the Thunderbird. It’s rare for someone to have a magical creature as a Patronus. Some consider ravens a kind of ‘bird of prey’, even though it isn’t so, and his relationship with my brother and sister could have affected him into changing some of his nasty habits. You probably didn’t notice, but both my sister’s and Mycroft’s Patronuses are birds of prey. Theirs have remained unchanged since they first managed to cast the charm. Mummy said once their Patronuses showed they were meant to be together, or some other sentimental nonsense.”
“I’ve wanted to make it up to him so badly, wanted to prove him how much I still care, even if we’re both too screwed up to fit together, I still love him deeply. But not as much or even in the same way as you do.”
John’s voice was muffled by the man’s long coat, and the man kissed John’s head, gaining a glare from Sherlock.
"Au contraire, my naive partner, Mycroft doesn't want to be Minister. But he is the favourite for the post, especially for traditional wizarding families. Holmes might not be a magical surname, but the name Greengrass still carries might. And, compared to the rest of the pureblood families, the family can boast of inclusion, having muggleborns," he pointed at John, "immigrants, black people and even reformed criminals on their mist. Not even the Weasley family had all of those before. While still keeping the money and status that old wizarding families are proud of, that is."
"You see, when I ran, I couldn't keep in touch, and it hurt him that I never reached out to him, or Luke, or his mother during that time. But I wasn't about to risk the only family I had besides Harry. They protected her, you know? After my parents died and I joined the Order, Tonks sent a message to Luke, and he hid my sister in his house, made her part of his own Fidelius Charm. They were a pureblood family and fought for and protected muggles. Luke died in the Battle of Hogwarts. For me, it was losing a brother. Oliver never spoke to me again after that day, not even at the funeral, when we buried all the fallen. His mother was in shock, and barely glanced when I offered my condolences." His eyes filled with unwelcome tears, the memories still too much to handle.
John chuckled at the statement, well, interesting to know she wasn’t dead. No doubt Sherlock was to blame for the unusual pairing. No doubt Mycroft already knew she wasn’t dead or did he?
John grabbed the man by the shoulders and pulled him down, finally shutting him up with a kiss. It started hard, Sherlock’s hands going immediately to John’s bare back and his touch felt like being burned and electrocuted at the same time. Sherlock took control of the kiss, his tongue teasing John, coaxing him to open his mouth for him, which he did with pleasure. He could feel all the blood flow going down and felt a little underdressed because he was being snogged senseless by Sherlock Holmes and he was wearing nothing but a towel. John pulled away from the kiss, and almost started again when he saw Sherlock’s mouth was following his. The doctor kissed the man’s nose instead, and Sherlock whined.
Sherlock was wearing black dress robes, velvety and luxurious, and you could see a bit of an aubergine shirt, which looked like John’s favourite, on the top. John decided on a white shirt before trying on the robes Sherlock brought for him. They fit perfectly, of course, tailored to the dot, and he felt flattered that his partner knew him enough to order for him clothing that looked so flattering.
Her wand flew out of her hand and she had only a second to create a shield with a non-verbal Protego. Wandless magic could only work for so long, and as she felt her shield waver the last thing she saw were two cold grey eyes staring at her, head just appearing from an Invisibility Cloak.
“You need Sherlock to find this Doctor of yours, who can travel through time apparently? How could he even find him?”
John knew better than to ask for explanations. Clearly, Sherlock had done something horrible to some poor unsuspecting agents in America.
John and Victor make a deal. Sherlock gets one of his birthday presents and the confrontation with Moran starts.
“I’ll make sure to add that to her file. Can you both sign her birth certificate? You left yesterday before the registrar arrived.”
“So brunch it is! I just saw Mummy and Daddy outside, tending the garden. Your roses are lovely Mac, too bad the weather here is terrible for them.”
Sherlock fell broken inside. John was running away from him, running to help his drunken sister in some inane activity, no doubt. And Sherlock would be alone, he would be out in the world without John Watson. And he felt like falling apart, piece by piece.
At this Sherlock's eyebrows raised, looking at John surprised. He loved that he could still, after all these years startle the man, even a little.
"It's all good; we are back on terms of endearment for you both now. Victor will be glad to hear from you. Let me know when we should assemble?"
This last sentence delivered in a no-nonsense tone that made Sherlock quirk an eyebrow to Victor, probably unused to the man ever speaking to him like that. Sherry the house elf appeared in front of him and bowed, gesturing to the stairs, and Sherlock reluctantly followed.
"Do I have to do the charm myself? My spellwork is a little rusty as you already know, and I've never performed such a charm in my life."
"Yes, for himself too. For him, for his friends. And magical law enforcement is involved. The whole operation is a professional enterprise from our side. I only want to see this to the end."
"Death Eaters. They murdered my parents looking for me. My parents, who always feared magic, were tortured and murdered with magic for the whereabouts of their estranged son, whom they hadn't heard a word about in more than two years. I sent a Patronus to Remus Lupin that day and joined the Order of the Phoenix. I wasn't in the Battle of Hogwarts; I joined a group that took back St. Mungo's from Voldemort's followers, and then we were sent to Hogwarts to tend after the many wounded left by the battle. I cried in public for the first time in my adult life when I saw Oliver, wounded, but alive. He wasn't as happy to see me."
“And Auntie would love the baby! When you go back to Baker Street, she will dote on her. Oooh, she already wanted to meet her. I have to send her some pictures. I just got her a new mobile phone.”
Mycroft shot a daring look their way, which disappeared as soon as he saw the look his wife was giving him.
"They say the Delacour women are a sight to behold. I never met any of them, though, was already out of school when they did the Triwizard. I would have loved to watch, but healer training wouldn't let me have a second leave after the Quidditch World cup."
Their confrontation with Moran approaches, but they need to go through his security arrangements before they can finally bring the man to justice.
"You have to remember it's not you anymore. You are carrying our unborn daughter. And this is not a regular assassin. You have to trust me on that Mary; the man is deranged."
He apparated on a safe spot he knew near Regent's Park, and he started walking. In the distance, he saw the tall man in a very posh suit and a Burberry coat with the checker pattern. He beamed at John and waved.
And with that, Anthea walked out, leaving the detective and the doctor alone in the flat. John was so tired; he didn't even feel hungry at all as he thought before,  though the last time he ate was a vague blur in his memory. The doctor moved to the kitchen, turned on the kettle and started to get busy making tea. He threw in some toast for good measure, dry toast because Sherlock didn't seem to have any jam. Who did his grocery shopping now? He went back into the sitting room and placed the cup in front of Sherlock.
