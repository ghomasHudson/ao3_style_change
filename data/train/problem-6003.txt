All eyes turned on him as he burst through the doors of the medical room. “He needs a Doctor. Now.” And suddenly Tony was being pried away from his arms. A loss he could not cope with at the moment. He followed the doctors till he could and then chose to slide down against the wall of the room they had taken Tony in. All of the sounds around him were a mere blur. The wave of guilt and worry hitting him hard once again. He buried his head in his hands. How could he let this happen? How did he not notice Tony was hurt? All he did was bruise his wrist further and spat out words he could not take back.
“When I cook, I will not be the Emperor Consort,” Tony said. “I will just be an Omega to my Alpha.” Tony explained as if that much should have been obvious.
“HOW DARE YOU!” The Emperor roared loudly as Tony’s head shot up in surprise. “Take the name of the Prince with respect! Do not forget that he is now the Emperor Consort of America. I will not tolerate any disrespect towards my Omega.” Steve’s eyes were wide in anger and Tony could feel the tension in his body from where he was standing. He was clearly one moment away from slapping Rumlow. This was the famous anger that Tony had heard about. He couldn’t believe that his Alpha who had been so gentle with him, could get this angry.
Steve knew that in the West, breaking off of a marriage was a taboo. Marriage was considered a sacred bond that once if broken, would bring years of bad luck on the Omega and his family. Steve could not imagine the kind of abuse Prince Anthony would have gone through over the years after putting his foot down against an abusive relationship. It angered Steve immensely.
The time for defence was over. Tony struck his sword once, twice, thrice at Rhodey, each of his strikes countered with Rhodey’s own.
Suddenly his left hand was captive in Steve’s and the next thing Tony knew was that he was being swept off his feet in a bridal carry. He could do nothing but grab onto Steve’s neck for support.
“Nothing you say is gonna convince me to attend the Charity Night. There is no way Pep. No way. Nuh uh.”
“Your Majesty,” Phil said, “Due to the battles we’ve fought there is a danger of recession in our Empire. Prices of all the necessary commodities are on the raise. The effect of this is the most on the common man.”
Tony chuckled humourlessly. Leave it to Pepper to comfort him in the worst of the situations. Tony knew she was saying this as an ice-breaker. All throughout the process of packing Tony had been uncharacteristically non-hyper verbal.
“My dear Omega please calm down.” Steve started emanating comfort pheromones. Hearing his deep voice up close, was not helping Tony at all. He shrank further into the headboard, as if that was possible. Steve decided that it was time to put some distance between them before he could start a conversation. He got up from the bed and move towards the door with his hands help up in a placating gesture.
Enough was enough. This palace had to understand that royalty were just people too. He could very well desire to cook for his Alpha like any other Omega would. “Calm yourself Sir Pierre, prepare the ingredients and I would need a heavier pot…” Tony said. He would not leave any stoned unturned for his husband today.
“Thank you Natasha for everything. You and General Barnes have really done a lot for me.” Tony had to say.
Then he noticed that Tony was actually standing on a step stool facing away from him. He was trying to nail the wall with a hammer. Anyone of the palace staff could have done that. Why was Tony doing something so unsafe? His Alpha instinct was going crazy.
Thor shook Banner awake and half dragged and half carried him back to their shared temporary room on the helicarrier.
It had all been done in his honour and Tony could not even feel the excitement as he should have been. The words spoken by Agatha were still ringing in his ears. The anxiety of losing his one lucky shot at a happy life was heavy on his mind. He thought back to the entire process of cooking. After Agatha had left. Tony had all but collapsed in Pepper’s arms crying. After a few consoling words and encouraging pats from all his Omegas, he gained strength and a new perspective. Her words had made him want to woo the Emperor even more now. Her words though were not easy to forget.
She was right. Tony was a fighter. Why was he submitting mindlessly to the whims of his father and the Emperor? He had to take a stand. He had to have his last attempt at defying this union. Tony knew for a fact that he was good at pissing people off. Perhaps he could push the Emperor into cancelling the union himself.
“Pep I am telling you, he his gonna be there, with his baby blue eyes, stupid perfect hair and that lumberjack beard. He will look at me with his sincere eyebrows and I will fucking melt Pep. I would go fall straight into his arms and he will push me back, like he did last time and Pep I swear to God I will not survive it a second time.” Tony was breaking her heart with his pleading tone.
He came across many of Tony’s Omegas in waiting on his way. They gave way to let him pass, chattering and giggling excitedly amongst themselves while also bowing down to the Emperor. That is when the voice also stopped but Steve’s trance wasn’t broken. He was still being dragged to the Omega’s royal quarters.
“Sam I am surer about this than I was about joining the army. I spent two years going through hell because I couldn’t tell the man who has my heart about how I felt. Now even if Tony hates me, I can’t spend one more day without expressing how I feel and that my feelings are not dependent on his. I will love him no matter what and to be honest, I know Tony would never sit down with me and have a conversation about feelings. This is the only way.”
Tony was about to issue his next orders, about which dish was to be prepared first, when an attendant arrived into the kitchen.
“Man of Iron, the Captain was worried and so were we. I am glad to see you alive. I cannot imagine losing another brother to battle.” Thor said in a serious tone which was new for him. This alone was evidence of the fact that Tony’s little debacle had truly shook him. “I am sorry for worrying you guys. I didn’t mean it” said Tony, regret etched on his face.
“The Queen,” Rhodey said, depositing his sword in its sheath. Tony followed suit. “Now like a good student, you must learn the ways of married life in a court from your mother.”
“I am the Head of the Home Ministry here in Brooklyn. I run the Empire and this Palace and on behalf of all of us I extend you a very warm welcome.” She said with a proud smile. It was very difficult for Tony to comprehend that an Omega was allowed at such high posts in the East.
He grabbed a hold of Steve’s wrist. “You really do care don’t you Spangles?” Tony said in a tone that he thought was mocking but really came out as hopeful.
“Your Majesty!” Rumlow sneered before he bowed and walked away. He knew that he was at the end of his rope in this argument.
Hope laced Tony’s voice when he spoke. “I shall be allowed to have a separate room that I will designate as my lab. I shall be allowed to make my own projects and experiments. I like inventing and I do not want to give it up just because I am getting married.” Prince Anthony’s hesitation was clear while he spoke, but he had put his foot down.
There was welcoming party, of Betas and Omegas all dressed in vibrant colours, awaiting him and all of them smiled brightly at him as he got out of his carriage. He had expected a less than cordial welcome since he was a Westerner and this was a surprise. Perhaps Tony should stop being so wary of the Rogers. May be just may be his luck had worked out for the first time in his life. He looked at Pepper silently conveying his thoughts to which she nodded in approval. So far, every one of them had been pleasant and accepting towards him. Maybe they weren’t the heartless invaders everyone made them out to be.
Prince Anthony would have to renounce his way of living, his home, his people and become akin to the lifestyle and mannerisms of the East should the marriage take place and Steve did not think neither he nor his family were quite fond of the idea. There were bound to be objections even in his family and court.
“Guys I…Tony…he just…” Steve tried. Tears were shining in his blue eyes. The team thought he could never hurt Tony but he did. That bruise was his fault and if he was not too busy being stupid, he would have caught on to Tony’s discomfort sooner and would have done something about it. This was all his fault.
The King seemed to shrink into himself. “Your Majesty, if you give me a chance I will show Tony what are the exact consequences of being a disobedient and demanding Omega.” Howard was hinting at the abuse, Steve had been thinking about.
“Tony you need to understand that you could have died. The team cannot afford to lose you!” Steve stopped Tony with a hand to his forearm, who turned around to face him. Tony was almost a head shorter than the Captain but he was not at all intimidated by his looming presence,
Only Rhodey’s eyes were visible from between the protective headgear and the cloth that covered his nose and mouth. There was a mischievous glint in his eyes.
Steve was lying on his back and the elephant lifted its foot to stomp him. Steve rolled away, getting to his feet and yelled, “Halt!” He looked at the elephant straight in the eye, ordering it to submit through his body language. The elephant wheezed and shook its head, its trunk moving wildly. Steve picked up a shield and tried to back the elephant with it. But, it caught his hand with its trunk, throwing him to the ground.
He had expected a burly old man to step in, ask him for his demands, snub them, move on and force Tony to marry him at sword point. He was not expecting a man, straight out of his fantasies walk in, talk to him with utmost respect and then not only accept but appreciate his demands publicly.
“Bring me the vessels in which Prince Anthony has tasted the food. I wish to eat from the same plate,” the Emperor announced. Tony looked up to meet his husband’s eyes and found them smiling at him with unbound affection. “The food will taste better that way.”
The first thing Tony became aware of was something prickling at his bruised wrist and a presence on his left. Later came the pain of what probably were stitches in his abdomen. Stitches he understood. He was expecting something like that. The presence and the prickling he didn’t. He looked to his left slowly, still feeling the affects of the strong medication he was put on. Steve Rogers. Captain America who hated Tony was sleeping on what felt and appeared to be their clasped hands.
“Well to see if he does, maybe you have meet him again… at the Charity Night.” Pepper knew she had Tony.
Rumlow and Miss Harkness looked as shocked as Tony felt but the Emperor stood his ground, glaring daggers at his foster brother.
“You dramatic idiot! I love you so much…I always have. I just could never tell you before all the shit that happened.”
“And what would they be Prince Anthony?” he asked in firm voice. If the demands were completely unreasonable, he had to maintain his stature.
Steve considered the man being presented to him. Thaddeus Ross had lost an eye and the rest of his face was covered in bruises and blood. The prisoner clutched his arm to his chest and Steve noticed the swelling in it. The man was wheezing and struggling to catch a proper breath. If it weren’t for Steve’s soldiers holding him up, Ross would have fallen to the ground ages ago.
“I cannot believe that you are saying that,” Tony said astonished. “How can you even claim to be the Emperor’s mother?”
General Fury, General Barnes, General Wilson and others bowed their heads in respect for their Emperor as Steve walked over to the fallen king and offered him his hand to help him get up.
“What is it, Sam?” He had asked Sam to investigate further into Howard Stark and his proposal. He knew something was up. This was not what a well-respected King of the West would do if they had another option.
Who was Rhodey? Steve knew Miss Potts was the Omega who had accompanied Tony from California and Happy was Tony’s servant who had given Bucky the message about Tony’s demands. But Rhodey, he had never heard of him. Was he another Alpha that Tony liked? God he hoped not. Enough about Rhodey, Steve decided to make his presence known. Steve realised that this also might be the first time he would get to see Tony’s face.
“I wish there was a way out Pep. I have tried to think of everything. In a few days I’ll be married to a cruel, unforgiving man who would control me for the rest of my life. I just want this to be a nightmare.” Despite Tony’s belief that by now he had exhausted all his tears, his eyes were now freely flowing.
Rhodey removed the cloth covering half of his face and fixed Tony with a sideways look. “Tones, this isn’t fair. I was just about to win when the page distracted me.” Even as he said the words, Tony could see that Rhodey had accepted his defeat.
Well Steve really couldn’t blame Sam. He never told anybody on the team other than Tony. Tony loved his voice. Often at night, when Tony couldn’t sleep, he would very authoritatively and cutely demand that Steve sing him to sleep. It was one of his best memories before the so-called ‘Civil-War’.
“My Prince this is your home. Please make yourself comfortable. Don’t ever hesitate in asking for what you want. I hope you have been comfortable till now.” Steve said.
“No General Fury,” Steve said. “He has already lost the battle. I refuse to attack a man who cannot even fight back. He is forgiven. I order you to let him go.” Upon hearing this, even the eyebrows of the fallen king rose to his hairline. He was shocked by the empathy the infamous cruel Emperor of the East was showing to him.
“Tony, sweetheart, would you like to tell me why I just opened the news and was bombed with headlines of an affair between Cap and you? The picture is quite nice though. He really swept you off your feet.”
As Tony got up to leave, he felt a wave of dizziness pass through him and all but fell back into the chair. He looked around and quickly checked if anyone had seen him do that.
“For that reason, Prince Anthony wishes to have a private audience with His Majesty in his royal tent,” As Bucky read from the parchment, he looked uncomfortable under his Emperor’s stern glare.
Tony took a deep breath and spoke when he was sure his voice wouldn’t waver. “As a child, I had no say in my betrothal to Tiberius. I had worked all these years to convince my heart of its fate and to accept that bastard until I couldn’t take his abuse any more. I thought I had left the life of abuse behind me and now, you ask me to marry a man… who is known for his heartless and cruel demeanour?”
General Alpha Sam Wilson, who had now recovered from the sheer shock at the stunt his Emperor just pulled,  made the introductions. “Your Majesty, the King Howard Stark of California, head of the Noble House of Stark awaits you.”
Cataloging these thoughts for later, Steve made a beeline towards Shield Medical on the helicarrier. He could feel the surprised, amused and concerned gazes of all agents following him. While they were expecting a full showdown in the conference room between the two heroes, they had not expected that it will end with Captain America carrying Iron Man in his arms. Steve couldn’t care less. All he could focus on right now was the limp man in his arms and his head of brown locks lolling to one side, resting on Steve’s chest.
“When can we see him?” asked Steve desperately. “Yeah Doc, lover boy here can’t wait.” Clint said with a snort.
Tony thought that over. That would not go well. What if the Alpha reacts badly? What if he has anger issues beyond Tony’s or Pepper’s imagination? He may wipe out the entire kingdom just because he was rejected by Tony.
Janet giggled some more. “Don’t worry, Clinton. The ones who lose in this game are the ones who get lucky in love,” she said.
“Pardon me, Your Majesty,” General Fury said, not sounding even a little bit apologetic. “But, being a loyal servant, I will only do the right thing to preserve the honour of the Rogers’ Empire.” With a cry, the General raised his sword to be brought down on the King but Steve blocked his attack with his own sword, mid strike and pushed him away, putting himself between the angry General and the fallen king.
“The Eastern culture gives both spouses equal rights in dissolving the marriage. It is in your right to do so if you are unhappy with the match. You can break the bond and become free once more.” Even as Steve said the words, a strange lump formed his in his throat, making it difficult for him to get the words out. He hoped Tony doesn’t decide to dissolve the marriage. He didn’t know why but he didn’t want Tony to leave. He had a feeling that once they got to know each other, they could be good friends – or even more.
“Let me go Steve. This is not funny.” Tony’s voice was weak and he was getting dizzier by the second but his determination of walking back to the tower was not subsiding. He looked around for Natasha to be the voice of reason here. Steve always listened to her.
The Emperor had left him behind to ensure Tony’s safety all throughout the journey and his utmost comfort at the palace. Tony had to admit Barnes was the first person in the Roger’s household who had managed to draw a laugh out of him. May be they could be friends? He was already calling him Bucky now. Tony was feeling a little less nervous than before. Bucky had assured him that Tony could approach him for anything he ever needed and he had even expressed his desire to be Tony’s friend.
As his party entered, Tony saw the Emperor waiting for him for the feast on his throne with Bucky on his right and Sam on his left. He looked extremely handsome in his white shirt, brown breaches and blue ornamented cape. His baby blue eyes shined with affection as they made eye contact and he gave Tony a blinding smile. Tony almost forgot all his troubles in that moment and blushed like a tomato.
“Baba, I also pray to you for guidance in the matter of my marriage. Please help me decide if this would be beneficial to all the parties involved. I am unable to comprehend why King Howard would approach someone from the East for his son’s marriage.” Steve sighed in confusion.
Deep in his thoughts, his hand began to shake as a few tears slipped out of his eyes. This made it too real. This was actually happening.
Clint was now wiggling his eyebrows. “Is that why you’ve been walking around looking like a tomato? I’ve never seen you blush this much.”
Tony bent low to touch his mother-in-law’s feet – the traditional Western way of greeting those who were most respected. He knew that it might seem a little outlandish to every one present there, but he was proud to display a few fragments of his own culture.
“Won’t say no to my best fella.” Steve’s cheeks were turning red but he was smiling so brightly that it lit up Tony’s whole bedroom. Then he left.
“Come on what Barton!” Tony suddenly snapped. It was his breaking point. “Talk to him and tell him what?! That I can’t live without him?! That the two years that we spent fighting were the worst years of my life including the time I spent in Afghanistan, which is really saying something. Tell him that come Steve let me trust you again with my heart so that you can push me back once again and shatter it completely?! That is what you want me to tell him?”
“Okay kids” said Steve, “Make way for Dad.” Steve said with a smirk of his own. Their banter was helping him calm down.
“Silence, Brock,” roared Sam. “This isn’t the time to discuss family matters. That, we shall do in private.”
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
That is when the other Omegas noticed that their Emperor was in the room now. As they quickly bowed down with a sweeping gesture of their hands, he signalled them to remain quite. He knew that if Tony realised Steve was in the room with him he would immediately crawl back into his shell. He knew he was being selfish but he just wanted to hear Tony chatter freely even if for a few more minutes. The other Omegas mean while exited the room without showing their backs to the Emperor as was rule.
“Have all the preparations been made Nick?” Steve said as he brought his trusted stead Dodger to halt beside his mentor. The battle was about to start. As upset as Steve was over the innocent lives that would be lost, it was his duty to fulfil the dream his father had once seen.
Steve nodded curtly at the King. The man was average in height and built with features roughened by age and battle. He had a mean and calculating look in his eye. Steve was not impressed.
The man was hyperventilating now, crying and struggling, doing everything in his power to get away from Steve, but he simply held him tighter.
“Yeah, me too...” Steve said rather breathlessly. Tony wondered if he was touching himself, but he knew for sure if he looked down to check he’d come before Steve even did anything.
Bruce looked for a moment as if her were searching for the best way to proceed. "Things aren't exactly good, Steve. That's not to say they won't be. A lot of these problems are easy things to fix but...I just don't have enough information." Bruce flipped open the file and started leafing through pages.
"It breaks every rule in the book." She said carefully. "Observation is one thing, contact is another."
There it was, this Bucky guy again. Tony wasn’t sure, but he thought maybe Steve had loved him. Really loved him. Tony was terrified that when and if he found him, he’d leave.
Tony wasn’t sure why he was so surprised. Actually, he was. Steve was so please and thank you apple pie. He said yes Ma’m and yes Sir to teachers, he wore button up shirts to school. That didn’t change the fact that his tongue was in Tony’s mouth, that didn’t change the fact that he had his knee slotted between Tony’s legs. He didn’t pull back until Tony started to feel sort of light headed. For the life of him he couldn’t figure out how they’d gotten here. The frisbee. That’s what it was. Tony could barely see the neon yellow on the ground just to their left, but was incredibly distracted when Steve’s hot mouth was on his neck. He’d been doing well up until then, but how was he supposed to
“Yeah, well he doesn’t have too.” The elevator doors closed, and Steve took a deep breath. His heart was already pounding at the aspect of dinner.
“You have a name, kid?” It’s been a while since he’d spoken to anyone aside from the man who’d come to retried the shield when he arrived.
“Steve?” Tony asked, looking away. He swallowed thickly and looked Steve up and down, enjoying the view, generators completely forgotten.
“Everything alright?” He asks, but his voice is still all low and dripping with sensuality, he looked like he was actually making a physical effort to sit still, to not lean forward and talk Tony’s dick right back into his mouth. That was a lot for a guy to take in-and Tony mind took it and ran with it, thinking of just how nice it was that Steve was so eager to get those pretty popsicle stained lips wrapped around his cock.
"We're fine. I was gonna make a few sandwiches, actually. If you wanted one." The formality between them was somehow worse than everything else. Steve didn't know what to do with it.
Tony was in a place. That was the first thing that struck him when he opened his eyes. No inky blackness, no hellfire. He was in a field.  The grass was tall, the soft breeze barely disturbed it and wafted along something strong and floral. The sky was so bright and blue he had to squint his eyes to look at it. Tony lay there on his back in that field for a very long time. He’d been stunned. Where was he? What had happened to him after the snap? He felt fine. Better than he had in years. The thought bothered him.
Was the next thing that came from the kitchen, and Tony sank back in his booth at the sound of the too angry voice, the image of his father coming to him for the first time in a long time, since the funeral.
Steve shut his eyes and blew out a breath. He hated this. Hated that she was so far. If something were to happen he wouldn’t be bale to get to her fast enough.
“Yep. Not the most exciting, then again I don’t exactly want it to be..” Steve said, rocking on the balls of his feet. He looked Tony up and down. “It’s good to see you. I haven’t gotten the chance to catch up with anyone since graduation.”
“Do you not care about the team Tony? All I want is some cooperation on your part and no one would have to risk their life! We are a team Tony! A team! Do you realize what it means? It means we are here to help each other! For God’s sake if something happened to you today…”
Just as he made it to the exit of the venue through the empty halls, his path was blocked by none other than the love of his life.
Tony didn’t answer. This made Steve curious. Was Tony unhappy with the marriage itself? That would explain his reluctance to even talk to Steve.
It wasn’t long before that the opposing king was brought before Steve, bloodied, bruised and on his knees.
“It is a favourite past time of mine to tame the untameable, King Howard.” Steve thought he didn’t sound too cocky. But, he was glad that Stark had seen him when he was taming the elephant. He wanted the King to know what he was capable of. If he was as calculating as he looked, the King would accept his imperial decree instead of trying to wage a war against him. But, then again, the King would not have made the 12 day journey to Brooklyn if he wished to fight the war.
The Noble had not finished but he stopped abruptly when a beautiful, soft voice came wafting through the air. The court fell silent as everyone looked around in search of the person to whom that voice belonged. But, Steve recognized it instantly. He had heard the voice only a handful of times but, the clear Western accent had been permanently etched into his brain.
Steve turned around and walked out of the room without a word, leaving the door behind him open, making sure that when he spoke, his Omega would hear him. Standing in front of the crowd of courtiers from both courts, Steve spoke.
His voice dropped down to a steely whisper, "You ungrateful brat. You don't even appreciate the power you have. The chance you have. This whole thing has always just been you satisfying your ego."
“Cover!” roared fury, as a handful of some of his most trusted soldiers blocked the view of the prisoner, the general and the young emperor from the army below them. General Fury charged forward and swung his sword in one smooth motion to sever the head of the hydra leader. The blood sprayed across Steve’s face, leaving a permanent scar in his mind and heart.
He felt the cool and calm hands of Pepper over his and looked up. “Tony, my Prince, everything will be alright. You are a fighter.” And something just
This got Steve's attention. Tony had never called Steve by his first name. It was always an impersonal Cap or a distant Rogers or one of the funny nicknames he was used to hearing from Tony. But never his name. Never Steve. Also, he was expecting a snippy retort or maybe even a yelling match. But not this. Not Tony begging him to let him go. Something was wrong. Terribly wrong.
Should he call Tony’s name? No that would be awkward. He just decided to clear his throat audibly instead. “Ahem…”
The King hesitated but Steve knew that this hesitation was not out of shame from asking for something. King Howard was clearly intimidated by him. That put a pleased smile on Steve’s face. He had tried hard enough to make himself known and respected amongst other kings.
He turned around to see his mother, the Queen enter the room. “Leave us,” the Queen ordered. She wanted to talk to Tony in private. Pepper bowed to the Queen and left quietly.
King Howard sighed heavily, clearly disappointed and angry and started move towards the Anthony’s room – most likely to remind the fiery prince that he is an Omega and in no place to make such demands, by force nonetheless. But, Steve stopped him with an angry glare and the King froze in his spot.
“We get that Tony and we are not angry just worried. Seeing you go through this surgery was not easy.” Bruce still sounded exhausted indicating that he barely got any sleep last night.
Steve wondered if he had misheard. The King expected Steve, the Emperor of the East to marry a Prince of the West? Not only was such an engagement never heard of but Steve  found it surprising that the King would be willing to let somebody from the East marry Prince Anthony. The feud between the East and the West was centuries old and Steve was the only Emperor till now who had dared to not only venture into but also conquer several parts of the West. He knew that most Royal families from the West were either in great fear of the Rogers army or thought that he was rotten to the core. May be even both. This offer had shocked Steve beyond belief. Even Bucky and Sam were standing there with their mouths open.
“Your Majesty, a few people in the village of Queens have started protesting against the royal crown due to your marriage with the Western Prince.” Said Brock Rumlow, his minister of land acquisition. Brock was a cold and calculating man. Steve never had much liking for him but even he couldn’t deny that Brock was a gifted fighter and an even better strategist. Steve had needed somebody exactly like him for matters like land acquisition.
"I know all this already." Steve interrupted. "We've already gone over this part. I'm doing everything I can."
The room was dead quiet. Steve could feel a drop of sweat rolling down the back of his neck, and he had a golf ball sized lump in his throat. He watched carefully as the judge was handed an envelope , and held his breath as it was opened. He balled his fist at his side as the man leaned forward to the microphone and opened his mouth to give the verdict.
Pepper took a deep breath. And nodded, then she realised that Matt wouldn’t be able to see it, so she cleared her throat and spoke up.
Tony gets home at three am. It’d been two and a half weeks since he’d been there, just long enough for things to be familiar and strange at the same time. You never realised how much you missed home until you spent two weeks hopping from hotel to hotel country to country. Tony was absolutely wiped, he was later than he was supposed to be. He’d told Steve he’d be home by ten pm. He was really going to have to make up for this one.
licking into Steve’s mouth, sucking on his tongue, biting at his lower lip as he pulled away. He got a moan for that, and already half hard Tony wasn’t sure how much of this he could take without having Steve actually touching him.
“Does this have anything to do with the case Stark worked a while back? The double murder?” the blind one, Matt asked.
“Why’s that?” it was more of a grunt that anything, and Steve wasn’t satisfied. He pressed Matt’s arms back further, until he cried out, until Steve could see his shoulders starting to dislocate. He smiled, he couldn’t help himself. The asshole deserved it.
“ Well, there’s this fella I’ve been talking to,” Steve said, running a hand through his hair, smiling crookedly. Tony felt his heart flutter. “ He’s been real good to me through this whole ordeal. Been figuring I’d ask him to a movie or something- seems he’s beat me to it.”
“Right,” Barns said, nodding and sitting back in his chair. “ Well fucking get on with it, what do you want?”
"I'm sorry," Tony said, simply, too quietly. He grabbed a sandwich half and was out of the kitchen before Steve could blink, let alone respond. He was left there to finish putting together the last sandwich on his own.
“ Let’s get out of here before things get crazy, there’s a car waiting up front.” Steve nodded, and before he knew it Tony had him by the arm and was leading him out of the courtroom. It’d been six months. Six long months being shuffled from house arrest to holding cell after holding cell, meetings with Tony and the police. Now he was free.
Steve made a small sound in sleep, and Tony looked over at him. His face was swollen and bruised. The only other time he’d seen Steve look like that was a few weeks into the trial. Steve had been jumped by a few guys in the shower. Steve had said they’d thought he was guilty, and had known the men who’d been killed and wanted revenge. It’d broken his heart to see him like that, both eyes black, and his lip split. It wasn’t fair. Steve hadn’t thrown a single punch back. He’d just taken it, waiting until guards came and pulled the attackers off him. When Tony’d asked him why he hadn’t tried to protect himself, he’d told him he didn’t want to give anybody a single reason to find him guilty.
Steve seemed a little distant over the past few days since their dinner, his eyes were always far away, he was always thinking about something, and when Tony asked about it he’d get this look on his face like a kid with his hand caught in the cookie jar. It was strange. He wanted to ask what was wrong, but with Steve nine times out of ten that just made the whole situation worse. So he’d keep his mouth shut and finish his work and let Steve be Steve.
Steve didn’t miss the disapproving note in her voice, and didn’t say anything as he entered the office and closed the door behind him. Tony was on the phone, so Steve didn’t say anything. He just put his hands in his pockets and walked around the room, letting Tony’s voice wash over him. He moved from one framed piece of artwork to the next that adorned the walls of Tony’s office, studying them as if it were his first time seeing them rather than the hundredth.
“ I know,” Steve said quietly, still moving. “ I know that, Tony. I like making you feel good.” At that Tony smiled and did his best to move with Steve, to maximise the friction.
“ You said you didn’t want to,” He murmured, pressing a kiss to Steve’s nose. “ We’re not going to.”
“ We did it,” he said, grinning and running a hand through his hair, taking his suit jacket off. Steve watched him, eyes mapping the obvious firmness of his chest under his starched white shirt.
“ No, Pepper. Steve had nothing to do with those murders and you know that. I don’t see why you’re so bent on proving he’s not a good guy-he’s never been anything but sweet to me and I don’t appreciate you talking about something you know nothing about. Now, if you could be so kind, I need you to file the paperwork on Mr. Gonzales's auto accident case.Her hearing is tomorrow at eleven” And with that, Tony grabbed his coat and left the office. Pepper worried about him, he knew that. She was worried about him taking the case in the first place, and worried about him no matter what. Tony loved her for that, he really did- but accusing Steve of something he hadn’t done-something he’d had to suffer for...that crossed the line.
Tony knew something. He wasn’t sure what, and he wasn’t sure how, but he knew something he wasn’t telling him, and it made Steve want to rip his face off. Paranoia crept up the back of his neck, he knew it was there, but he couldn’t acknowledge it due to the thick veil of tiredness the painkillers had tied down over his brain.
“What’s going on here?” Tony asked, getting on eye level with the still half hard, brick red member.
“Fine,” Steve said, moving to pull off his undershirt. He’d have to be more careful next time, he had Tony content on his story, but if anybody came looking they'd see the bruise and they’d know for a fact what he’d been up to. Steve tossed his undershirt in the trash and pulled on a clean sleep shirt. He pulled off the exercise shorts he’d been wearing as well and climbed into bed in his boxers. “You can pick the movie.”
"Don't. Don't do that to yourself. She's here. There's nothing that can be done to change that, now all you have to do is take care of her until she's old enough to make her own decisions." Maria said, looking down at her granddaughter fondly. "I just love her name. Morgan. So regal. Of corse I went to the lake to watch her birth."
“Fine, Just trying to make this last a little longer, s’all.” Tony muttered, shimmying his pants down a little lower and squeezing himself hard, fingers wrapped around the base of his erection. The tip was nearly as red as Steve’s lips, and it was spit slick and shining. Steve stared at it a hungry man might stare at a plate of hot home cooking.  Then he smiled, finally tearing his eyes away from Tony’s crotch to settle on his face.
“You must be exhausted,” Steve said quietly, running his fingers through Tony’s hair, kissing his temple. “Love you. Get some rest.”
“Is that so?” Steve asked, rolling his eyes-and that was ridiculous, if anybody had to right to roll his eyes it was Tony, because that engine was literally screaming for help. As they pull out of the parking lot Tony tries to ignore the sad, uneven rasp of the thing. "What would you say if I told you I got it like this?"
Things hadn’t changed much. Steve picked the Kid up as he walked, she was falling asleep on her feet, going too slow. He needed to see them. His team, familiar faces. It’d been so long since he’d spoken to anybody that wasn’t twelve or trying to kill him. He got in the elevator and pressed the button for the communal floor. It all felt alien to him. It didn’t feel real. He was prepared to wake up at any moment and still be in that windowless white room, sleeping on the floor, the Kid burrowed into his side. Maybe this was a next development? Maybe the last test they’d run had wrung out anther development in the terrifying power possessed in those tiny hands. That thought came to an end when the elevator opened, however. The common room was empty. Steve practically ran to the kitchen, when he set the kid down in a stool he was nearly out of breath. There was a pizza box on the counter. He opened it, there were four large New York style slices of cheese pizza. He tore off a piece of the pie and shoved it at the Kid, who had it in her mouth before he had a chance to blink. He couldn’t blame her, as he stuffed a piece into his own mouth he thought he might cry. It was so good. Who knew food could be so good? The Kid was just finishing her piece as he was grabbing his second when she jumped off the stool and clumg to him, cowering behind his legs. She raised a hand, and reflexively he shoved it down, turning quickly to follow her eye-line to see-
“ Are you sure?” Tony asked, the question muffled in Steve’s side as he mouthed the glorious skin of his hip. Steve made a sound of frustration.
The week following the party Steve disappeared. To be fair, Tony’d buried his head in the workshop for a solid three days, but not without shooting him a text, asking him if he was free anytime soon first. Work was an alright distraction, and he had more than enough to do if he wanted to have his AI fully coded and functional before he went to MIT, but that wasn’t going to happen if his focus kept breaking as he looked down at is woefully dormant cellphone.
“Nah, I think I’ll be fine.” Steve watched with no small amount of shock as Matt easily made his way across the floor to the ring and hoisted himself up inside of it.
It was late. Steve was out cold, Tony couldn’t get him to actually stay awake, so he sat up to keep an eye on him. He wasn’t sure if it was just paranoia from his conversation with Pepper, or the fact that Steve had come in so late that made him feel like there was something Steve wasn’t telling him. Tony knew Steve had gone through some things, things that could be worse than the entire trial combined, and it killed him that Steve couldn't talk to him about it, that he couldn’t find a way to make him feel better.
Steve was shaking too, by time those twelve blocks were up. He was worrying the Kid now, her anxiety shot up through him, he had to let go of her hand.
Steve struggled once more against the restraints. This wasn’t normal, was it? The restraints weren’t anything special. They were simply straps. He should be able to free himself—but even every ounce of strength he had wasn’t enough. What was happening?
"I need to know more. Her vocal folds are mutilated, her ovaries have been removed...there so much more I don't understand. That means I could be missing something, and that's dangerous in any situation. Especially here. I need to know the conditions of birth-if she even was birthed-"
Holy cow, I started this when I was seventeen and haven't touched it since. I'm working on editing the story as a whole, and I'm planning to stop being a literal piece of garbage and actually finish it.
“I told you,” Steve moaned, like he was embarrassed, but not ashamed. “I wiated for you. Didn’t…didn’t touch myself. I didn’t make myself come. I wouldn’t even fuck myself on my fingers,” from the look on his face it seemed like Steve had really wanted to. From the state of his dick Tony knew he wasn’t lying.
“I'm going to turn in. I think you should try and do the same.” Bruce said, turning his back on the cell as Steve stirred and sat up. Tony didn’t want to leave. He took a few steps backwards, still watching. He saw Steve speak, but soundproofing kept him from hearing any of the words that came from his mouth. Finally, he turned his back, exiting out the door Bruce held open for him.
Tony hardly waited for Steve to put the truck in park outside of his house before he was on him, sliding across the bench into his lap, bracketing Steve’s thighs with his knees. Steve arched up to meet his mouth half way, and Tony let his hands tangle in that blond hair. He picked up where he’d left off, licking into Steve’s mouth, sucking on his bottom lip as he ground down, allowing himself the friction he’d so badly wanted from the moment they’d gotten into the car. Steve let out a little grunt, his hips canting up, attempting better angle. Tony could feel how hard he was, how
“Thanks. I don’t live far.” He said, falling into step next to the taller boy as they walked to the car. The night was warm, not much cooler than the day. Tony could feel sweat beading on the back of his neck.
“So you’ve said. I just don’t like leaving messes.” Steve said, turning back to the sink to finish the dishes. Tony frowned, sliding off the counter to walk around Steve's side so he could look him in the face.
A slat in the wall opened up and a tray of food pushed through. He rushed for it, he hadn’t eaten anything since he’d arrived. It wasn’t a lot, a sandwich made only of bread and cheese. The way the kid was staring at him he could only guess she was about as hungry as he was. He offered it to her. She shook her head. Shrugging, Steve took a bite, but before he could eat any more the tray shot out of his hands and hit the wall.
Tony was talking to him, but Steve couldn’t hear him. He was laser focused on the screen on the table between them, watching Bruce examine the Kid. She was out cold, entirely defenseless. He didn’t like it. It made his entire body vibrate with anxious anxiety.
“After I fill you up maybe I’ll plug you up. Maybe I’ll make you walk around all day with my come in your ass, you want that?”
“ What happened to you, Steve?” Tony asked quietly, his stomach sinking. There had to be a reason why he wasn’t still in the military now-something had to of happened.
him. His eyes moving up and down, shamelessly taking in Tony’s well fitting clothes. There was a light in his eyes Tony’d never seen before. He finished up pouring his drink-Tony could smell it from where he was standing. Tequila.
Tony swallowed thickly and turned away from Steve’s grasp. Tony wanted him, he did, but sleep was inevitable, and he was barely keeping his eyes open as it was.
“I have people who do that, you know.” Tony said, grabbing an apple from the bowl on the counter and taking a bite.
Steve laughed lightly and sat forward. “ Who says I’ve had practice?” They were close now. Steve was taking up the open space in the car, and Tony could feel his breath on his face. For half a second he got lost in those eyes and how bright they were, in the laugh lines next to them-but the car stopped and he was pulled out of his trance. Tony cleared his throat and opened the car door.
“I wan to see you again.” Tony said, covering himself with the blanket as Steve buttoned up the stupid uniform shirt.
“ What?” He asked, setting his fork down, the feeling of cold dread rising in his stomach. This was where Steve was going to tell him that there was someone else, that he didn’t want to be with him anymore. Tony knew it would be coming, but he didn’t think it would be coming so soon.
There was already about thirty people there. Tony was late, but only by about forty five minutes. He’d tried to be his usual fashionably late self, but it seemed impossible. He spotted Steve almost immediately, standing at a table with a hodgepodge of hard liquor, beer and mixers set atop it. Tony made a beeline.
Soon, maidens entered his tent to bathe him and prepare him for the wedding ceremony that night. He was cleansed with turmeric and milk. His skin felt as smooth as silk by the time they were done and his hair fell neatly over his shoulders in baby curls. He was being gift-wrapped for the Emperor.
“Nick, kindly pass on my message to the King Howard,” Steve told his second in command, “that I would be willing to accept his proposal of a marriage alliance with his son. And make it expressly known that I would be pleased to do so.”
Natasha and Clint, quickly shuffled towards the small coffee shop on the flying marvel that the helicarrier was, trying their best to avoid what was to follow. Natasha, before leaving, sent a look of concern towards Tony, to which he nodded and smiled. The paparazzi smile. She knew something was up. Maybe she can confront him later. Then she sent a quick warning look towards Steve as if to say - go easy on him. Going by his expression, she knew Steve had dismissed it completely in his rage. They made their exit, hoping the argument would not be as bad as last time.
Tony’s thought process was interrupted by the sound of a heavy sword swooshing in the air. With Tony’s experience in weapon design and making, he knew this was no ordinary sword. He had to take a look. He got up from his bed and walked to the balcony attached to his quarters. The balcony gave him complete view of the other wing of the Palace and the courtyard below.
He was extremely surprised when the Emperor had respected his wishes, even left the room to make him feel comfortable. Despite all his suspicions, Tony had a new hope in his heart. May be just may be he will be happy this once. May be the Great Alpha was not as bad as Tony had assumed.
The King visibly steeled himself before talking. Perhaps, Steve should have steeled himself too. For what he heard was not something he ever expected to hear from the other King.
He moved closer to Miss Harkness so he could speak without needing to raise his voice the way she was already doing it. He had maintain the semblance of respect. Everyone was watching them.
However before Tony made his objections known, Pepper smiled at him knowingly and said, “Tony dear, there is no way you are objecting to it. After my Parents died in that horrible raid, I have no one but you. If you think you will leave me here in California and go and suffer in Brooklyn alone, you have another thing coming.”
It was on a fine morning after the Avengers had moved into the Stark Tower, no the Avengers Tower, that Steve realized what this was. He had just come back from a run and was grabbing a bottle of water from the fridge when Tony had walked in. Tony, with his big brown eyes gleaming with a new idea. Tony, with his constant bed head and disheveled clothing. Tony, barefoot and in search for coffee. It was in this moment that he truly knew he was fucked.
“But, Mother, he is an Easterner,” Tony argued, tears threatening to obscure his vision. They were currently in the room that Tony had recently designated as his lab. The room was filled with various tools and parts from the armoury along with parchments full of ideas and calculations. This marriage was bound to kill her son’s spirit.
I am so sorry this was not updated sooner. My best friend was visiting me after 1.5 years so I just had to take some time off.
“Nat, would you please take the Prince to his royal quarters?,” Tony noticed that she requested rather than ordering.
He fits perfectly in my arms was Steve’s first thought and then he looked at Tony’s face. Beautiful. Big honey coloured eyes with immense depth in them. A cute little nose. A jawline crafted by the Gods themselves and the most genuine and innocent look on his face. His Omega was just…just beautiful.
“Greetings, Your Majesty,” the King said, looking at Steve, who was still mounted on the Great Elephant, in admiration and awe. “We have heard great praises of your bravery and today, we were fortunate enough to witness it.” Steve smiled humbly. “This was a truly amazing feet.”
There was an immediate flash of blue crouching down with Tony. “Tony what happened? Let me see!” Steve, in all his glory and concerned eyebrows was making grabby hands at Tony’s foot.
Tony stopped his play with the swords and answered. “Tell the Queen that I will be with her shortly.”
Tony felt his face heat up even more – which at this point should have been impossible. He cursed his body for reacting so much to the Alpha’s touch. Moreover, the Emperor had not been angry with him. Just busy. For a person who took pride in the fact how quickly he could piss people off, Tony was very happy with that confirmation.
“And…” Natasha sat in front of Tony. She was holding a plate with a red cloth on it. She pulled the fabric back to reveal a pearl and jade neck piece. “He has sent you a gift.” Next the sounds of gasps from all his Omegas in waiting were heard. The piece was exquisite.
Steve saw exactly when Tony left. He had his eyes on him the whole time. He could see that Tony was crying but then he left. As much as that confused Steve, he knew he had to complete the song. Complete his thoughts, his one-sided conversation. He continued singing.
His eyes then fell on the subject of his musings. The Prince was sitting shyly on the bed with his head bowed, knees drawn to his chest and his hands hugging them close. His earlier deductions of the prince’s physique turned out to be correct. And without the curtain veil to hide him, Anthony looked even more exquisite. His face however, was still covered by the veil.
Steve’s blue eyes widened for a second and he took a step back. Oh my God! Captain America can sure look like a kicked Golden Retriever. It almost made Tony feel guilty.
“Tony please stop crying sweetheart. It doesn’t matter. You are here with me now and that is more than I could ever ask.”
“Nat please be a dear and tell Pep that I actually showed up. I am sorry but something came.” He could always count on Nat.
Finally, after he was alone, he gathered enough courage to hold Tony’s bruised wrist gently and look at it in disgust. This was his fault. “I am so sorry sweetheart. I never meant for this to happen. I was so angry at you for putting yourself in danger. What if something happened to you Tony? I would not be able to live with myself.” His voice was barely above a whisper and tears threatening to fall down his eyes.
“Our favorite Tin-Can is alive after all!” came in Clint’s voice and the spell broke as all the other Avengers entered the hospital room to check on their injured team mate. Tony looked away from Steve and smiled at the others. “I am not as weak as you think I am Hawk-ass” Tony said with a teasing smile. “Oh, he has retained his wit. Thank God. But seriously man you scared us. Please be careful next time or Steve will sure as hell rip someone or something apart.” Tony glanced briefly at Steve who simply blushed and looked down.
Tony saw the tents being erected and the Rogers’ flag, deep blue with a lion roaring in front of the rising sun, flying all over. He could literally picture all the old Omegas in his family fawning over the grandeur and telling Tony how lucky he was. If only they knew how he will be treated. Perhaps they did and just did not bother with it.
“I am very grateful to you,” Tony continued pulling Steve back from his thoughts, “for fulfilling my demands. I don’t know why but, I have this fear and doubt in my heart. I haven’t been able to accept this marriage wholeheartedly. Perhaps this is because of how different our cultures and traditions are. I did consent to the marriage and yet, my heart is not ready to be mated to you.”
Thank you so much for your amazing respons on this. It keeps me going. I will respond to all the comments very soon.
“My Lord, apparently Prince Anthony has had a very difficult childhood. Howard Stark is as cold and calculating as he looks. In addition to that, he is a horrible father. He had promised Prince Anthony in marriage to Lord Stone’s eldest Alpha son Tiberius. We have found out that Tiberius, least to say was both emotionally and physically abusive. Prince Anthony suffered at his hands for years because as a child he thought he had no way out. Howard had made him believe that since he was an Omega, he had to follow what his father said or he would be committing great sin.” Steve could see the disgust in Sam’s eyes as he spoke. No wonder, Howard had given out a bad vibe from the start.
Carefully, quietly, wanting a better view, Tony sat on the very edge of the foot of the bed, careful not to dip the mattress. Steve was moaning, little quiet huffs of sound from a half open mouth, and Tony decided that his next passion project would have to be dreams. That way he could get in on the action on a completely different level—unclean as his intentions might be it would be groundbreaking…
Tony frowned and shook his head. “And I had plans, too.” he muttered, patting Steve’s jaw and moving away towards the bedroom.
“Oh, look at you.” Maria Stark rushed over to him, slinging a bag off her shoulders and taking his face in her hands. There were tears in her eyes, but she was smiling.
When Steve came, he didn’t make a sound. Tony could tell how hard it was for him, staying so quiet. His face was beet red, and he bit down on his bottom lip hard. Tony even saw him twitching,
“Is that so, Mr. Stark?” Steve asked, teasing. He looked more relaxed that Tony had seen him in weeks. He looked even better in the suit he was wearing, even though it was a cheap and state issued from Wal-Mart. Hell, Steve had even managed to make orange jump suits look good.
“Everything we’ve done to you. Every refusal means-“ He stopped talking and waved at the screen. A prod came into view, it buzzed as the  thing was pressed to the Kid’s middle. Her entire body twitched.
“I think we’ve established that. You sound tense. Looking for some fun?” Steve let out a breath, looking at the bed. There wasn’t a wrinkle on it. It still wasn’t right. He pulled everything off of it, starting over from square one.
“I’m fine, Tony. It’s what happens. I can’t punch a guy and expect him not to punch me back.” Steve said, wincing as Tony ran his fingers lightly over his bruised eye.
“I’m sorry, I didn’t mean to, I’ll clean it up-“ came a second voice, an incredibly familiar voice. Tony perked up in his booth, trying to see into the kitchen through the service window.
hard under those shorts. He made quick work of them, deciding that it was an actual sin that Steve was still wearing them in the first place.
Tony walked over to the elevator and punched the button, taking out his key to call the penthouse elevator. It was right then, when his heart was beating fast and hard and his mind was reeling a mile a minute, that he realized he loved Steve Rogers with every fiber of his being, and he got scared.
“I’m fine Tony, nothing to worry about...just thinking about some stuff.” That seemed to be enough for Tony, because he nodded and reclaimed his seat on the counter.
“He didn’t invite you to go?” She asked, it was obvious she was getting at something, and Tony was starting to get frustrated.
“It’s telekinesis, I think. Everything else is just…she’s got good senses? I don’t know, she’ll make you feel things. Whatever she feels. All she’s gotta do is touch you. It’s how she talks.” He felt almost dirty divulging the information without the Kid there to hear it, without her permission. But she had killed for people. Four good people. They’d have to talk about that.
“You don’t get to make demands, Tony. I’ve had a while to think about this. All on my own.” Steve ground down hard, punctuating his statement.
“Steve it looks like he beat the shit out of you, your eye-.” Tony said getting up and lightly grabbing Steve’s face, turning it from side to side, inspecting him .
Tony didn’t have to wonder long how he’d do it, however. Because when he finally made his way through their quiet apartment and into the bedroom, that lights were already on.
“Yeah, I’ll be there,” Tony said, pulling out his own phone to show the virtual invitation for some graduation blowout in Malibu State Park. He wasn’t ready for what happened next. Steve took his phone from his hand. Steve Rogers snatched his phone right out of his hand, and there was literally nothing Tony could do about it even if he’d of wanted to. He slowly opened his mouth to protest, but Steve handed the phone back to him before he could.
“I don’t like that. I’m not sure I really want to know.” Tony said, shaking his head, taking a few steps back, feeling suddenly very unsafe. He watched as the kid laid a hand on Steve’s bare arm, an arm much skinner than the one Tony was-had been used to.
“Dreamin’ about me Precious?” Tony asked, scooting closer to Steve so he could run his lips along the line of his jaw.
Not as stunned as he was, however, when Steve grabbed him in a loose hold and kissed him. Right there in the middle of the sidewalk.
“Hm?” Steve just took a bite of the popsicle and raised a brow as if Tony couldn’t see that he was half hard under the stupid Target cargo shorts he was wearing. (Steve refused to let Tony take him anywhere a t shirt cost more than 5 dollars.)
Tony sat upright so quickly he nearly lost his balance. He looked around wildly for the sound of the voice. It couldn’t be who he thought it was.
“What did they do to you?” he asked, but Steve knew he wasn’t really to answer. He supposed maybe that question was the hardest of all of them to answer, because he really didn’t know. It wasn’t this hard to talk to the Kid. Hell, it wasn’t even this hard to
“I didn’t.” Steve said, reaching across the driver passenger side, the side where Tony’d rubbed himself off until he’d come only moments ago, and pulled the door shut. “I’ll see you around Tony.” Steve said, rolling down the window.
“Who’s ‘some things’ then, and when exactly are we going to sort them out by?” She sounded eager. Steve could always count on that. The thing about Natasha was she didn’t really discriminate. She didn’t plan these things out like Steve liked to, at least not as thoroughly as he did. She liked the thrill of picking a target in the moment. She liked the chase, spontaneity. That, Steve couldn’t handle. It’d been part of the reason they’d parted ways. She’d cut it too close one too many times. He could only imagine what she’d thought when she saw him on television, handcuffed and in orange.
So he kept it up. He was more careful now, planned out his victims, made them look like suicides rather than having any fun,fun was what nearly got him caught in the  place, but it was enough for him. It worked, so he was thankful. When a taxi finally stopped for him, he got inside dragging his bag in after. They made small talk about boxing, the guy remarked that Steve looked too big for anyone to be landing any hits, and Steve made up some garbage about helping a guy train and letting him get a few licks in for the hell of it.
“Well, now I’m here too, I guess. The good thing is, I’ve got friends who’re gonna come get us out. We’re not gonna have to wait too long. They’re smart people.” As soon as he said it he wished he hadn't, because she really looked like she believed him, smiling for the first time. She had a good one. It went all the way up to her eyes, reminding him of Tony.
“Tell me,” Tony said. leaning up to bite at Steve’s shoulder. There was something hot about Steve being naked over him, hard cock pressing into his thigh while Tony was fully clothed. He was probably getting a precum stain from the weepy head of Steve’s cock. Steve ruted against Tony’s leg and pushed his blazer jacket down over his arms and started working on his shirt buttons.
"You know, you're gonna have to pick a name soon." he said, changing the subject as they entered the kitchen.
“I uh..” Steve was looking down at his plate, he hadn’t even picked up his fork. “ How was your day, Tony? Was it alright?” It was a sudden question, and Tony was thrown off by the sudden change in the tone of his voice.
"Dad, of course I like her! Did you see her?" Harley replies, offended that that would even be a question that needed to be asked, as if his dad hadn't interrupted Harley in the middle of trying to profess his love.
Neither twin seems moved by Harley's display of emotion, and he takes a second to school himself. "Besides, I don't want to creep her out, I just want to go on a date and hold hands and look at the stars on a clear ni-"
"Wait, I think Thor might have some Vaseline or something around here," Steve says, lowering himself to press a kiss to Tony's lips before fumbling to the front of the van, scratching around before finding a bottle of hand lotion.
Steve deftly passes two pint glasses to them, rolling his eyes at his housemates. This was definitely a bad idea, none of them wanted to just be nice for once.
The situation just can't be helped right now. When Morgan and I finally meet, and I can explain to all of you the situation, you'll understand. I promise.
"Maybe he thinks if he's mean to you, you'll like him back," Bucky says, grinning big as Steve throws dagger eyes at him.
"Hey, kiddo. I saw your light was on and I was just about to make some hot chocolate, you want to join me? When can get a movie playing or something?"
A voice breaks his reverie. "Look who finally got off that farm of theirs to grace us with their presence." Nat was the picture of perfection as she came down the stairs, trailing a hand along the stair rail and over Bucky's shoulder as she came to stand behind him. "Where have you been, James? I've been lonely."
Steve holds his hand until they get to the restaurant, going as far as to lock their fingers loosely across the table once seated. The waiter gives them a shy smile, and they order without taking menus.
By the time they join Sam downstairs, he's pacing in front of the door gesturing for Thor to unlock it. Tony is giggling up a storm sitting in the corner above Bruce, the genius' head cradled between his thighs.
"What are you playing out, Daddy?" The toddler asks, excitedly sitting up in Tony's lap to peer up at him.
Thankfully the captain's boy, Harley, was still above deck when Tony had finally managed to pull himself up from the floor. Aching from the beating and numb with confusion and hurt, he sat quietly as the boy patched him up, drawing the shawl he'd rested on his shoulders closer.
Jess snorts, waking Morgan, and jumps to rock her back to sleep. "Scoping out the territory, I say," she whispers loudly, a gentle hand rubbing up and down the baby's back.
"Now Tony, what did I tell you about going out and looking for trouble?" A (thankfully) familiar voice asked, Sam drawing him up and tucking him into the crook of his neck where a calming woodsy scent settled over him.
They run into the boy downstairs though, the blonde padding to the lounge on bare feet and not even sparing them a glance, besides a nod of acknowledgement.
"That, or Captain Ass is getting nervous. No one's come calling for him yet, which definitely takes a hit at that huge ego of his," Matt supplies, sliding his glasses up his nose.
"We don't know yet, we'll have to see how things play out," Tony informs them, stretching out his arms when Jamie comes barrelling into the room. "Okay, no more work for the rest of the weekend."
James Rhodes had never believed in distracting Tony from his problems, he always believed in taking them head on and dealing with them so that they couldn’t come back to bite either of them in the ass (in the bad way, Tony had always purred). Looking at Tony now though, body beaten and broken, with a million and one machines attached to his body keeping him alive, and no way of knowing what happened (he could guess, Vision brought the arm and the shield back after getting Tony to the hospital and thoughts of Rogers hadn’t been met with anything but rage and the need to go out there and find him, legs or no legs, and make him hurt so that he felt even a smidgen of what Tony must be feeling – and boy did he feel better thinking about the legs than he did a week ago, his therapist would be proud), Rhodey wanted nothing more than to make him feel better, to take away that pained look in his eye and the scrunch in his nose that meant he was over thinking everything and probably finding ways to blame himself for everything that had happened. Not for the first time, Jim wished he could help Tony, take some of the burden and worries off his shoulders, and spare him this world of pain that the last few weeks, years, had turned into. The baby would survive, she was Tony’s after all, and Jim willed it so. Losing the baby would just be another thing to destroy Tony, and the man was suffering through Atlas’ burden already.
Tony hums, sliding his phone out of his jacket with his free hand. "Smile for the camera, everyone else is stunting on us."
Bucky snorted, slinging his bag off his shoulder and walking over to sit down beside Tony at his workdesk. "What does that mean?"
"I just thought it was an interesting observation," Sam says nonchalantly, readjusting his hat on his head.
"If we pool all of resources and information together, we might just be able to do it right," Tony interjects, spying the slight change in Namor's demeanour.
Thank you babes, hope it wasn't too horrible. Let me know what you think, what you'd like to see, and if there are any tags that should be added or updated. Also, happy belated birthday to the Queen We Chose, Miss Emilia Clarke <3
In between the machine finally coming alive and waiting for the login screen, a few soft knocks start up at his door, drawing his attention. He sets his notes aside, kicking loose socks and clothes under the bed before opening the door to see who's on the other side.
"Okay," Steve says defeated, deflating in his chair and going through his notes again when Sam leaves.
Steve groans miserably, reheating Sam's leftover curry from a couple of days ago. "I barely remember what happened last night," Steve moans, head bursting with every scrape and thud the first years made. "Clint, is there aspirin?"
Tony thanks the doctor, peeking down to see Peter was fast asleep and drooling on him. Now that he has the chance to look at him more closely, even jn the dark Tony can see where Peter has been picking at his skin, and that he's been biting his nails again. While these didn't completely set his radar off, a full-blown panic attack in the middle of the night wasn't something they could ever take lightly.
"Okay, you're killing us here, Ri," Sam finally says, turning to face her fully. "Just tell us what your perfect date would be like, minus the seafood and bowling."
The food's good, and the company's even better; Tony's leaning against Steve as the group watches Thor and Sam try to out-do each other in karaoke, both ridiculously belting out the words to Jolene.
"Please, and you think you're a looker?" Gwen shoots back, joining her twin on the bed and moving her foot in circles, like the hand of a clock.
"You know Sam, one of these days you won't be able to speak for you and Stevie any more, especially since he's real sweet on our dear friend, Tony now," Bucky pipes up, trailing kisses along Natasha's collarbone.
Steve blushed furiously, and Tony has never seen a man turn that small in a matter of moments. "I don't think they do that down South either..."
"NEPHEW?" Tony shouts, piping down when about a dozen of the heads in the tavern turn to him. "Nephew? Nephew? You sure have lost it, Natalia, did you bump your head or something?"
"Well, he goes with Richards." Thor shrugs, as if that's answer enough. "Reed makes sure nobody bothers him unless they've paid for his time, and that's
Routine and structure were good for him, keeping his mind busy and tiring himselfbout was even better.
"Sorry." Tony gave him a small little smile, dimmer than his usual ones. "I think I reached my limit two drinks ago, you know."
"Interesting; there are great places in Manhattan, would you be interested in going to any of them?" Sam asks, smiling at her unguarded.
"I missed you today," Steve says when he pulls away, both of them gasping for breath and a second away from devouring each other again. Tony says nothing, he keeps kissing Steve like a he's an oasis in the desert and Tony's a dying man.
Riri almost chokes on her water, before laughing nervously and gingerly putting the bottle down on her tray. "Listen kids, you guys are adorable, but I'm n-"
Tony wrinkles his nose cutely, but takes Steve's outstretched hand anyway. "God, please no. Just Tony is fine."
"Samuel Wilson," Nat cries in indignation, slapping his arm with her handkerchief. "Do y'all say anything when an Alpha way past his prime walks around here with a pretty young thing on his arm?"
"Of course, I understand," Riri says, spotting his dad coming out of the house. "But if you're up for it, let Ned know there's a spot for him too. Our guy, Amadeus, wants to meet your guy in the chair."
Riri throws herself down in his desk chair, spinning in circles as Peter brought his bag over. "It's not really that deep, Peter," she laughs, turning to face him. "You've manifesting your powers already, and we would really appreciate another webslinger on the team, especially since Ms Marvel is training with the Captain and not many supers are around these parts."
"See what you want to do is not lnly turnover and fertilise the soil, but you're going to need structures for the vines to grow with." Tony fans himself with his straw hat, pointing to the sections of land that would be best suited for it.
Hope you enjoyed the read, please let me of tags I should add! POSSIBLE TRIGGERS: there's mentions of both implied abuse by Howard and Tiberius, nothing graphic or descriptive, just a line. Mentions of heavy manipulation and gaslighting by Natasha and the rest of the team, and the possibility of infant death (IT DOESNT HAPPEN). What do you guys think Steve went out and did? Its very similar to the movie. Also, DESCRIPTIONS OF INJURIES/SURGERIES. They're listed but not described!!
"I'm in mechanics, remember? Anyway, we have access to this lab for robotics, which I'm totally only going to take for one semester."
Steve, flushed red from the warm sun, looks over his shoulder. "Yeah, Bucky got those. The fertiliser we got was the right one?"
"Okay, can you two take it upstairs? I have customers trying to enjoy their doggone meal!" Remy shouts from the bar, all pink in the face.
"Ugh, fine. But I'm only shaking on it if you both agree the deal is null and void if you don't make it happen by the Spring Formal."
Tony scrubbed at his hands and face harshly, willing the soot and coal to come off. He couldn't dirty his room again, Madame Masque did nightly inspections of the hostel and had fined him extra for the marks his oil-stained hands had left on the dresser. He dunked hid head in the barrel, hoping to get it at least semi-clean until he could go by the bath house.
Balling his fists up, Tony takes a deep breath. "That's not what I'm doing here, I know what it looks like, but I promise I'm not that naive." Tony couldn't just release Natasha back into the unknown, she was most of that group's brains anyway, and without her, they couldn't go getting into any major trouble.
Steve's smile drops, and a look of concern overcomes him. "Tony, you're scaring me a little here. What's wrong?"
The new football season had finally kicked off again, AU celebrating a narrow defeat against Xavier's, which of course meantbopening the frat for celebrations, some kids from Xavier's joining in because everyone knew the Wolverine, and he never said no to free drinks.
"Rich kids tend to run in the same circles, no way around it," Tony shrugs, plopping down beside him on the bed and scooting him over to lay down side-by-side. "What I'm more interested in, is what an art nerd like you is doing in a body like this? Not that I object of course," Tony teases, lighting up the joint he'd swiped from Danny.
The boy splutters, almost dropping the textbooks he was hauling over to his closet. "Wha- uh no, we, uh, just figured it was kind of an elite society you know? I heard you guys had to personally invite people," he mumbles, staring at her with curious eyes. "Not that we wouldn't not want to join!"
Looking embarrassed by the praise (or probably freaked out by Peter's babbling), Riri scuffs her shoe against the wood floor staring determinedly at her untied laces. "Uh, no worries, Peter, I'm sure everyone knows by now, you know it's physically impossible for Kate to keep juicy gossip quiet," she jokes. "My dad signed me up for a 'Young Innovators' competition, and I guess they liked what I did," she supplies, eyes not lifting from the floor.
"There is no both, you silly Omega, come on," she says, dragging Tony up behind her. "I know just what to do to relieve some of your
And as Steve swings back to stare, he does in fact see Danvers approach them, cupping the unknown brunet's cheek and greeting him a little
When they pull away for air, Steve's face is flushed all the way down to his chest, a noticeable bulge poking Tony's thigh. "So you're definitely not up for morning sex?"
"Please," Namor snorts, pushing the binder away from himself. "You couldn't even control them in your smaller groups, how on Earth do you expect to organise and control them in a larger one?"
So when his chem partner, Riri, tells him they can't meet at hers after school to do their semester project, Peter internally freaks for about .3 seconds before his brain kicks back into gear and he reluctantly suggests that they can head to his. Riri is really cool, and all Peter wants is to be her friend, and she loves science just as much as he does (maybe even more) so he knows for a fact she'll love his lab.
Steve is warm, and comforting, and everything perfect rolled into one human with a horrible fashion sense and a penchant for upsetting any tech he comes into contact with. Steve treats him far more gently than he deserves, and some tiny voice in the back of his mind hijacks things completely and does a rerun of his talk with Bucky.
"Let me help you carry that, Tony," Steve says when he meets him by the road. "What is all of this?"
"That's good then," Nat says, and at the three pairs of eyes staring at her questioningly, she explains, "Tony's been out and about with Johnny Storm, Sue's little brother."
"Would I go into the city for seafood?" she asks, receiving twin nods of confirmation. "Why not? If the place is really good, I'd definitely be up for it."
Harley flinches and narrowly avoids groaning out loud. Stomping to the hall and ignoring the looks Pops shoots his way, he focuses on getting his hair right.
Bucky recounted his chat with Tony in the lab, pulling on his hair. "And then he kinda just freaked."
"That's fine, make sure he takes his meds before you come over too, I'll get in contact with his therapist."
So Peter calls home to make sure it's okay with his parents to bring a friend home, and so that his dad can bully the family into behaving, and is understandably nervous when he leads Riri to the indiscreet car parked by the school gate. She laughs good naturedly when he rushes to open the door for her and signal her to get in, but says nothing, leaning against the window to peer out at the city. The closer they got to the house, the more nervous Peter gets, until Riri (probably picking up on Peter's dorky nervous energy) starts talking about finally starting Star Wars, leading them into a long debate over whether or not Rey actually was a Skywalker or not.
"Even so, certain factions and certain organisations are eager to have them back, though I doubt anyone'll stick their neck out for Lang or Barton," Matt says matter-of-factly, inclining his head to Tony. "It's Rogers they want."
"Definitely," Steve reiterates, nuzzling into his neck. "What did you want to do today beside getting into my pants?"
"Why would you do that?" Bucky asked urgently, wanting to club himself for lwtting the guys talk him into undertaking the task. Natasha would flay him alive if she found out about what he did.
"Yeah," Tony says, a thickness to his voice. Before Ultron, and before the Maximoff girl, Tony would like to think that they had been friends at least. He still can't figure out why this even still bothered him. It's been month's for Pete's sake!
"Fifty bucks they demand to see you within twenty four hours of getting here," Jess pipes up, Morgan sleeping in the cradle of her arms.
This time around, they don't fully have control over the situation, and can't control how much information gets out, so by the time they're transported to the US, the news is already splashed over the front page.
Tony quirks an eyebrow. "Do you mean the drunkards who are too busy trying to get a knot off that they sometimes walk into the sheriff's office thinking it's Nat's?"
Blowing out a breath of frustration, he flips the burner open, going to messages and furiously punching out a text.
"Never mind that, Tony," Bucky says, tucking the covers beneath his chin. "You just close your eyes and drift off, okay? I'll have a cheeseburger waiting for you in the morning."
Steve grins at his son, taking plates out for lunch, and Morgan's bowl. "Jarv, can you tell everyo-"
Steve chortled again, slapping a hand across his chest. "My, you do have a mouth on you. I didn't believe Bucky or Sam."
Laughing good naturedly, Reed walked him out of the forge, a bounce to his step. "And here I thought you weren't like the other spinsters in town. Sue should take you by the farm and introduce you to her mama."
"Yeah, it's the last time I'll ever listen to my mother. I ran away from a perfectly innocent goat straight into the hands of bandits," Tony explains, reaching over to take another sip of water. "Or maybe what she said was true, and he was the reason that happened. Oh Lord, I guess I'll have to go to church on Sunday."
Shuffling into the kitchen, Tony gets a pot out, searching the pranty for chocolate and grabbing a fresh carton of almond milk.
Then Steve is moving, drawing back from the kiss and adding some of the lotion to the condom. He lines his cock up with Tony's entrance, one of the brunet's legs propped over his shoulder, and gently but steadily starts pushing in past the ring of muscle. They moan together at the feel, and then Steve pushes all the way in, bottoming out and leaning forward to litter kisses over Tony's chest.
"Yes, then. Peter didn't just have a cold or flu, what he has probably won't ever go away, but that doesn't mean he isn't able to manage it in a few ways," Tony explains, grabbing Morgan's hand as she starts leaning back out of his hold. "Every now and then, it gets really bad for him though, so I'll have to take him to the doctor in the morning."
Tony plucks it out of his hand, urging Steve closer to him with the heel of his foot pushing urgently against his ass. Looking down briefly, he pinches the tip and rolls the condom onto Steve's cock, tongue poking out between his lips. Steve throws his head back, pleased sounds escaping his lips and shallowly thrusting into the loose fist Tony uses to jack him off.
Peter is glaring at the phone in his hand, like he has ever since he found it in his locker. He had remembered to grab it last minute, afraid his Dad would find it if he had to go back and pack for him.
"Who is he, and what's an Omega doing working in the smithy?" Steve asks bewildered, resting the crate on his shoulder and rushing his steps to catch up with Thor when the brunet disappears down the street.
"Tony!" Steve's eyes light up, but Tony's sure that's just a trick of the light. Steve has one of his big goody grins stretched across his face, shuffling out of the booth for them to move in.
"I know, but I still make time to come look for you every Saturday. You've been blowing me off." Natasha studies her friend, from his slightly-thinner frame, to the poorly concealed deep-set circles under his eyes.
The line connects. "Mr Stark, how can I help you tonight... uh this morning?" Dr Park asks in his deep accented voice.
"I gave you guys unsupervised access to my corner of the lab, and dessert for six weeks!" Harley cries out, looking at them incredulously.
"I'm saying," Tony starts, a little desperation bleeding into his tone, "we need a unified structure amongst ourselves, and a few teams have already agreed."
Steve takes his sweet time working up a satisfying pace, shallowly thrusting in and out before Tony grabs his ass and tries to fuck himself on Steve's dick. "Steve, I promise to God I'll get on top, ride you until I cum, and leave you here for Thor to find with the biggest, bluest balls in existence," Tony threatens. "I know how to make a DIY cock ring in under five minutes."
And with that, he shuts the door, furious whispers of "seriously, you jump right into a monologue?" followed by a dejected "I panicked!" rising from behind it.
"You didn't lose me, James," Nat yells, kicking at his feet before sinking down beside him and leaning in for a kiss. Steve turns away, eyes resting on the brunet beauty once again. He's swaying back and forth now, Rhodes's hand shoved into his back pocket like they were in some teen flick.
"What's understood doesn't have to be explained," Tony says smoothly. "We have our inside jokes though, Platypus, no need to be jealous."
"How do I know this isn't just a ploy to learn Atlantis's secrets? I've heard about you, Stark, and Richards. You'd stop at nothing in the pursuit of knowledge."
Bucky was usually the one to come into town, but he'd come down with a chill, and so Steve was left with doing deliveries and getting something for his best friend's illness by the town doctor.
"We haven't had a Code Blue in a while, has he been taking his meds?" Peter had been taking Prozac since he was thirteen, both for his anxiety disorder, and to help him with a PMS disorder he'd been suffering from  since he was thirteen.
Wiping furiously at the tears that now streaked his cheeks, Harley grabs onto the back of Tony's shirt. "Yeah."
He catches sight of Steve on his way over, the blonde throwing his head back in laughter at something Nat says to him. Tony's heart beats a bit faster, because Steve is so lovely, and so
"Pump those breaks, kid. We barely spoke," she says, but before the disappointment could catch up to Peter, she adds, "but you can give me his number and we can see where it goes from there."
The brunet who'd silently been grinning throughout their conversation, straightens up, smile dropping. "You see how she bullies me into things, Steve?"
The man grins at him, resting a sack of potatoes against the wall of his shop. "That's Tony, prettiest thing to blow into town since Nat."
"Lang and Barton both have kids, they must have been feeling the heat from being international fugitives." Luke gets up with a shrug, heading outside to help Ben with the grill.
"Oh, of course you do, kiddo." Tony shrugs, shoving his hands in his gown's pockets. "I can still bring you a cup if you want though? Maybe it'll help you sleep better."
"For now we're going to admit him for a few days until we see a change in his condition, he'll be undrr twenty four hour care so there will always be someone checking up on him," Dr Park informs, sliding his spectacles up his nose. "All you can do is be by his side supporting him, Mr Stark."
Steve scrunches his nose up, washing whatever product his son had slathered all over him off of his hands. "And I thought we talked about all these chemicals you were putting in your hair. You know in my da-"
The walk to Steve's frat is cold and dark, and Tony curses himself for leaving his phone behind and not grabbing a jacket or something to keep him warm. So far he'd almost been driven over twice (but really who drives around this time of night? Creeps), and had just nearly escaped a fatal encounter with one of the geese that permanently resided on campus grounds.
Finding none, he settled for the loose beads from one of the jumbo drinking cups, and with not-so-precise aim, threw them at his beefy blonde's window.
hope you guys liked!! I always start off with one idea, nd as I write the story and scenes take on a life of it's own lol.
Panting, Tony doubled over and emptied his stomach, shakily accepting the flask of water one of his saviours passed to him.
Slinking back into the back of the wagon, Steve throws an arm around the crate of goods they'd bought in town, getting lost in his thoughts to the sound of Bucky and Sam bickering outside.
When Harley had brought him to dock amidst rain and a horrible cold front, Tony was uncertain whether leaving had even been the best choice. At least if he'd stayed, he'd have a roof over his head and some form of certainty over whether he'd live to see tomorrow (
"Okay, we get it." Gwen rolls her eyes. "But are you seriously not even going to listen to what we're offering?"
"Oh, that's cool," Riri says, dragging a chair from across the room to Peter's desk. While she normally hated group projects, working with someone like Peter was a godsend, at least she wasn't going to have to do it on her own or finish it the night before because her partner bailed.
Tony knew he did not need to hide the letter from her. She could see Tony’s emotions as clear as day, after all they had been friends for roughly 18 years now. Pepper was the daughter of the royal cook, who accompanied Tony during his play time. Over the years she had earned Tony’s trust and friendship. Other than Rhodey, if there was anyone Tony could confide in, it was Pepper.
“No! Get away from me! I am getting the hell out of here.” Right as Tony was about to storm off, he heard the announcement of the next performer which made him stop dead in his track.
Before he could complete the sentence, his brown eyes, his big, beautiful brown eyes lost all focus and he started listing sideways. It was only Steve's quick reflexes, that he was able to grab Tony around the waist in time, before he could hit his head on the tiled floor.
“Really that is what you have to say to this. Steve I am done with you and your mixed signals. You yell at me in one moment and the next you are holding me in your arms, calling me sweetheart. You sit by my side without eating or taking a break in one moment and then go back to avoiding me in the next. What the fuck do you want from me?” Tony was practically yelling at this point.
A lab and permission to have his own projects as an Omega? Prince Anthony’s was very brave to demand something like that. Steve always appreciated creativity and was supportive of Omega rights. He didn’t understand why did the westerners felt that they did not know how to treat their Omegas. One of his most trusted Ministers, Natasha was an Omega and that was just one example. The demands put forward by the Prince were brave and remarkable.
And that was exactly what he needed at this moment. The proposal put forward by King Howard had perplexed him beyond imagination. He knew his decision would not only affect his life but also Prince Anthony’s and the life of the people of both their states. He had already given a lot if thought to the matter but could not come up with a definitive answer. Steve had never been as spiritual as Natasha, one of his ministers and closest friends was, but somehow he had a feeling that this matter would require divine intervention.
“I have made my decision Maria.” Howard said in a firm tone. “I am not here to ask you for your opinion. I am here to tell you that it is your job to train Anthony to be on his absolute best behaviour when he marries into the Great family. God knows that boy is trouble. Specially his new obsession with inventions. Do you know he blew up the entire stable day before yesterday? No wonder Lord Stone’s son dumped him.”
“It was an administrative decision, respected Head of the Nobles,” Aunt Agatha said stepping forward. “And it was perfectly in His Majesty’s right to take such a decision. Choices that are in the good of the Empire should be taken without our Faith clouding our judgments.”
Steve just scoffed, let go off Tony’s arm and walked ahead towards the tower, leaving Tony behind. Oh no! No fucking way! Now Tony wanted to argue.
This particular subject has been worrying Steve too. He knew war is taxing on the economy but it was a necessary evil. He decided he needed to discuss the matters with his most trusted courtiers. “This subject requires special attention. Therefore, we will discuss this in my private court,” Steve announced. “Next subject.”
Natasha and Tony had become close lately. She had even started training him in knife combat. She was way more dangerous than she looked. Tony and the bruises on his body could vouch for that.
The only thing he could think about right now was contacting Rhodey. He knew the Colonel, bless his soul, would go to any extent to get Tony out of this situation. He had seen first hand how miserable Tony had been with Ty. The gaslighting, the causal pushes, the eventual slaps. He had been with Tony all through out. Only he would know what to do. Tony ran a hand through is usually messy hair. He had to do
“How was the journey till Brooklyn my dear? I hope Bucky took good care of you?” was her next question. Tony was still working on finding his voice after all everything that was happening to him was extremely overwhelming, so he just responded with a polite “Yes, Your Majesty.”
“This is all my fault Nat. I was so mad at him that I never bothered to ask if he was okay after taking the hit during the mission. I grabbed him harshly as he was trying to escape from the conversation. The bruise on his wrist is my fault. He kept whimpering, practically begged me to let go of him but I just ignored it in my anger. The next thing I know is that he is limp in my arms and blood is oozing out of his mouth.” He took a deep breath. It was difficult for him to continue. “I just carried him to medical and -…” his gaze was focused on his shoes. He could not dare to look at Natasha. Not after what he had done.
“I have heard that the Emperor is a man of great beauty. It is said that he has muscles cut out of steel, face chiselled out of marble and the stature fit for an Emperor. Betas and Omegas alike throw themselves at him,” said Pepper.
“Do not bother yourself with their words,” she said. “There is a limit to how high a frog can leap. And that is all this is – a frog trying to jump higher than it can. They just want other people to question your leadership at any cost.” Steve nodded, his rage subsiding a little at Aunt Agatha’s calming words.
Her and Natasha then led him to another group of women, who were dressed in simple, linen clothes. “Let me introduce you to Ms. Agatha Harkness – Steve’s wet nurse. She is like a mother to him. And she is also a minister in the Rogers court.”
But even the mightiest warriors need peace some times. A monthly visit to his father’s grave was his way of escaping the royal chaos that was his life. The peace always helped him make better decisions as well. The piece of land where it was situated was also extremely beautiful and the embodiment of tranquillity. It was covered in greenery and located beside a clear stream of water, with a gentle breeze blowing and only hints of the warm sun.
“First you demand a ‘lab’ be built in the Rogers Fort and now you annex the Imperial Kitchen?” she said with suspicious eyes. “I understand everything…”
Steve wanted to. He really did. He had been training for battle for as long as he could remember with General Fury. And he did not wish to disappoint his mentor. He also wanted to earn the respect and loyalty of his army. But, he just couldn’t do it. His conscience would never allow him to.
The marriage ceremony was as grand as Tony had expected it to be. Thousands of relatives and courtiers were attending. It was all decorated with flowers and rich curtains in a white and lavender colour scheme. The Emperor wore traditional Eastern attire comprising of a blue shirt complimenting his eyes and black breaches with a very heavily ornamented cape. The crown he wore was made of solid gold and had very intricate designs on it. Tony on the other hand wore the traditional western garb, an ornamental blouse with flared pants and a heavy veil covering his face.
He was about to apologize again when he saw Tony sway dangerously on his feet. His apology was interrupted by Tony speaking in a shaky voice.
“ You think he was guilty?” Pepper asked, and Barns ran a hand through his hair. His face flickered between so relief and frustration so many times Pepper wasn’t sure whether or not she’d actually get the information she was looking for while the guy was so emotional.
“No time for that, Pep. Gotta get to the conference room. I’ll head down, you clean up—and don’t think you’re not telling me what’s going on. I want the details-“
He wasn’t sure how long they stayed together like that. Tony atop of Steve's chest, his head resting in the crook of his neck-but sooner or later, Steve got up, and Tony, despite the uncomfortable stickiness of his thighs, wished he hadn’t. When Steve returned, it was with a warm towel. He wiped Tony off, then cleaned himself, the pulled the covers back and tucked Tony under them. He got under himself, and held Tony close. Pressing a kiss to the side of his head before leaning over him to turn out the light. Before Steve laid back down, he leaned over Tony and pressed a kiss to his forehead.
Tony looked down at his phone. Upon unlocking it, he saw that Steve had taken the liberty of adding himself to Tony’s contacts as Steve Rogers (;.
"They thinks she's missing." Was the first thing out of her mouth. "They've been looking for her for two weeks, there aren't any suspects, and the usual suspects all have solid alibis." She walked past him into the house. Tony motioned for her to keep her voice down, pointing to a still sleeping Morgan on the couch.
Tony had to put a hand over his own mouth when he realized what Steve was doing. He’d been so entranced in watching Steve tease himself he hadn’t seen the big picture.
“Fuck,” he breathed, pulling away, leaning sideways so he slid off of Steve’s lap and onto his back on the seat, and Steve followed him, sealing their mouths together again and rolling his hips, grounding down hard.
“Can I make it up t’ you ‘morrow?” he murmured, face smushed into the pillow. There was the smallest of pauses, and then Steve was angling his erection away from him, rubbing at his arms and shoulders, running his blunt fingernails up and down his back. It might of been the best thing Tony'd ever felt in his life.
“Only when I want to get stabbed to death by freaks in the woods,” Steve said casually, taking a long drink from his cup. Tony saw a shiver roll through him from the taste, but he put the whole thing down in two gulps. “Or drunk.” he added, setting the newly empty cup back on the table, filling it again.
“Why’d you have to go and do that?” Steve asked, throwing another punch, right to the side of the head. He took a step forward. “ See, now that’s gonna bruise, and I’m gonna have to explain to my guy why I’ve got a shiner.” Which meant he’d have to lie, and that just pissed him off. He took another step forward and struck again, and again, and again, until the guy and wobbling on his feet, weakly holding his hands up. “Aren’t you gonna say anything?”
“Don’t call me that.” He said, but it sounded way more like ‘fuck you.’ Before Tony had any sense to apologize, though he wasn’t exactly sure what he’d be apologizing for, Steve was pressing into him.
“Mornin’ babe,” Tony said, making a show of sitting up and yawning, rubbing his face and eyes. “Sleep alright?”
Tony bent his head slowly, blowing air on Steve’s cock, watching as it filled out again, standing proud in front of his face. It took everything Tony had not to take Steve until he choked.
indulging him now, however in the moment he stoops down to pull the tiny bottle of lube out of Steve’s shorts pocket and comes face to face with a dick so hard it stood nearly straight against Steve’s toned stomach.
“You keep doing that to me not sure if I’m gonna be able to stay standing up.” Tony huffed, feeling weak in in his knees, putting a little of his weight into the hands he had resting atop Steve’s head. He leaned over a little, and couldn’t help the floating thought that he could fuck Steve’s mouth, just like this. His cold, wet mouth with the warm throat beyond it. It would be good too good-
“ Steve!” It was Pepper. She was sitting at her desk, rummaging through sheets of paper. Steve put on a happy face and turned to look at her. “ Oh, god what happened to your face?”
“Shit,” Steve huffed, and only then Tony realized he had to be putting on quite a show. A bead of pre come appeared on Steve’s dick, and Tony lapped it up, sucking the head into his mouth, never breaking eye contact. Steve’s hands were suddenly in his hair, tugging lightly, and Tony really went to work. He swirled his tongue around the head as he ground into the seat, getting closer and closer to his own release as he took Steve as far as he could go. The zipper of Steve’s work pants bumped against his nose. He hummed and sucked hard, feeling light headed as he gave one final roll of his hips down into the seat and came right there, with Steve’s dick in his mouth. He pulled off with a groan, just in time to catch Steve’s load on his face. Before he could do anything Steve was pulling him up, and god, he was strong. Tony felt like putty as Steve kissed him, but not before licking himself from Tony’s lips and around his mouth. After one more kiss Steve took off his shirt and used it to wipe Tony’s face as clean as he could, and Tony let him, hands wandering over the now bare chest as he did his best to find the ability to speak. The windows of the truck were fogged over, and Steve’s chest was still heaving, and Tony was proud. He’d done that.
Just the sight of Steve there, sucking a wet spot into his jeans made Tony want to come. Steve shook his head though, and Tony whined.
"I really am sorry. I didn't mean to make you jump." Clint said, extending his hand in truce. The Kid simply looked at it, then at Steve's back. "You shake it. Like this" Clint took her hand and shook it. Steve watched from the reflection of the toaster, smiling a little. She was learning. Slowly but surely.
They’d been in school together for years, and for years Steve still managed to confound him. He hadn’t always been the beefcake sitting up on the lifeguard chair. If he had Tony wouldn’t of gotten away with half the shit he did to him when they were younger. Tony wasn’t exactly proud of it, the bullying, but he’d been a child. All children are assholes, it came with the description, right? Right?
“Maybe after I take you on a real date huh? Maybe friday? Dinner?” And his stomach was right back up in his throat. He was the one being taken on a date? That didn’t normally happen. He had the money, he liked to treat people, where as Steve didn’t have much but he still wanted to….
Tony left the office at six forty five, much to Pepper’s displeasure. He could smell the food as soon as the elevator doors opened, and Steve had even lit candles. He was already sitting at the table when Tony walked into the seldomly used dining room, but he stood, taking Tony’s bag and jacket and kissing him hello.
Defying all of Tony’s expectations, the Great Emperor had just tried to calm Tony down first before encouraging a conversation. Even when this was the last thing Tony had expected, the encouragement given by the Alpha helped him to be completely honest with him.
The sword made a swishing sound as it cut through the air. The Emperor performed some impressive manoeuvres some of which Rhodey had taught Tony and some which were entirely foreign to him. He guessed that the Emperor probably designed them himself. He moved his sword with such speed, accuracy and confidence that Tony found himself in a reverie. With his back to Tony, the Emperor widened his stance, spread his hands out, with the sword pointed straight at an invisible enemy. His rippling muscles flexed with the movement.
