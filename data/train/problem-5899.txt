I was hyper-aware of the sound of footsteps, people, trained people running into the room. A booming voice ordered Deadpool and Daredevil to back up and ordered others to train the sonic disruptor at me.
Pain, as Bruce thumbed on of the spinnerets, forced a whine from my throat and everyone froze. I looked at him, wide-eyed and had to keep myself from jerking my hands from his grasp.
Well, Deadpool slipped up.  At least the hard part was over.  Now I just had to explain the whole mess to the Avengers, my family.  Yay~~  ......Deadpool, come back!
“Take it easy,” Fury said as he moved closer to my bedside.  “You were pretty close to the blast,” he continued as he lifted a cup of water with a straw towards my mouth.  I reached out to take the cup when I noticed Fury had raised an eyebrow in his silent commanding style.  Was he serious?  I felt my own eyebrow raise in response.  For a few minutes that were a bit terrifying, we stared at each other before I finally gave in, letting my hand fall back on the bed with a sigh.  It's not that I couldn't win.  It's just that it was very unlikely when it came to SHIELD's director.  Surrendering, I sipped from the cup, letting Fury put it back on its table when I was done.
One week into this “R&R” and I feel like I'm about to go insane. Seriously. How did I do it before I came to live with Steve and Tony? I would love to go back to school. Did you ever thought you'd hear me say that? I didn't. I even miss ol' rocks for brains Flash. The dude seriously needs to work on his anger issues, but at least it's something other than resting when he shoves me into lockers.
Regaining consciousness after taking heavy hits did not tend to differ much.  It did, however, come a little bit slower this time.  The haze from the pain and exhaustion was so thick I compared it to this one time Aunt May had tried to make pea soup.  Ehh... How does one get liquid to solidify by boiling it?  Needless to say I was not about to comment on how that had happened, which it was always safe to keep your mouth shut when it came to cooking failures in that house.
“Spider-Man,” Daredevil murmured in my ear anxiously. Anxiously? That wasn't right. “Peter, look at me.” I looked at him, brows furrowed, body feeling weak and numb. “You're okay. It's okay,” he told me. “We've got you.
The sounds of angry screeching made me frown and I turned my head. I was laying on the floor, pretty wary of its sanitation.
“Director Fury! Bit early for a pleasure call, isn't it? Or is this business?” I can only mentally beg that it's a business call. I'm about fully healed and I'm ready to go kick butt. It seems Daredevil and Deadpool haven't caught up with the Goblin yet, so I can't wait to track him down and tell him how grateful I was that he revealed my secret. (Yeah, I'll tell him. With my fist.)
“Maybe he forgot his undies?” Deadpool suggested, huffing as we reached the main armory. Everyone turned to give him a disgusted look as they grabbed more weapons. He shrugged. “It could happen.” Sure it could. Had it? Unlikely.
A light flickered on on the rooftop I was standing on. It was a kind of night-light that I'd not seen before. Perhaps people came up here at night? It could happen. I did like the ambiance of the city at night from high places.
Matt's small smile and soft chuckle caught my attention. I smiled over at him, grateful to have him there with me, grateful to have everyone there with me. Another twinge of pain made me wince. I would've hated to have been alone with this.
That responsibility led me to doing everything I could to separate myself from the dark alien. I tried everything I could think of. I tried pouring gas over myself when we were together and lighting myself on fire. Didn't work. I tried cutting it from my body. It threw the knife away. I tried drowning. It saved me. No matter how I tried to separate, it never seemed to do any good.
The guards looked down at us, huddled together against the wall. I'm sure they saw two people who could hope to somehow phase through the wall to escape. We were trapped, and I wasn't going to enjoy it. Ever.
This was actually a painfully slow chapter to write, but compared to the others and how much I'm lagging with the updates, I'm not going to complain.
“He's done a lot of good.” I looked over at Matt. Bucky's hand reached out and ruffled my hair annoyingly as he smirked, “Yes. He has.” I flushed when I heard the pride in their voices. It was like they weren't upset that I'd kept Spidey a secret from them, like they thought I had done a lot of good as Spidey. ..It felt good.
“You've been denying it ever since they took you in, Peter,” Matt continued, watching as they fought. “I know you were worried for them, but look at them.” He waved his hand at the battle. “They're the Avengers. They can take care of themselves.”
The girl nodded and set her small hand in mine, allowing me to pick her up. “Okay, put your face against my chest okay?” She did as I had asked, nodding into my chest. “Good job.”
He seems to understand and hugs me tightly in return, shifting so that we can both sit on one of the motel level beds. They sag under our weight with a groan, but at least they appear clean. “I'm sorry,” he murmurs in my ear. “I'm sorry...”
Thanks to FeatheredParrot for help choosing which fanfic to work on.  Hoping for "The Vigilante Way" on Wednesday.
I began to fiddle with the comm, trying to tap into the system. I was happy that Tony taught me more about comms. Not that I couldn't have figured them out on my own. It's just that having someone there to teach you was like having a guide to show you not how to get lost.
It was hard not to smirk all the way back to the cell. I was going to have no problem telling Wade that I got “lucky”.
“Petey!” Wade cries as they throw me back into the cell, his warm arms wrapping around my body to keep me from falling. “Shit! Are you okay?” he asks, concerned.
“Pool..” I reached out, blindly as I kept my eyes shut against another throb of pain. I felt his gloved hand slip into mine and he squeezed it gently. “That's my name, hot cake.” I laughed despite myself. 'Leave it to Wade to use the Japanese title for pancakes as a nickname.'
The lights turned on, shining brightly overhead. “Oh my god, it burns!” I struggled to bury my head in Bucky's shirt as he groaned, covering his eyes with his robotic arm.
I puff out my lower lip in a show of pouting, but I know he's right. Geez, Matt always knows when he's right. ..Admittedly, he's not very wrong often.
Usually this is where I'd get whacked, beaten up, something broken, but Doc Ock just smiles. What the hell, man! Creepy! Like this dude shouldn't be allowed near children creepy. I narrow my eyes at him. If he's this happy despite my quips, I'm probably in deep shit. Deep, deep shit. In other words, when I get out of this, Tony and Steve are never going to let me leave the Tower again.
I get choked up now and then, but by the time I'm finished I feel oddly light.  I know there are some details that I skimmed over.  Telling everything over two years would just be way too long and I honestly don't want to stay here any longer than I have to.  Everyone looks shocked, guilty, sad.  I'm not sure I want to know what's going on in their minds, but there's something I have to ask.  I'm afraid to ask, yet somehow I do.  I want to know what they think of me.  I need to know.  So I open my mouth...
Luckily calmer heads prevailed.  Well head.  And by that I mean Uncle Bucky.  “SHUT UP!!!”  His loud, hard voice washed over everyone like icy water and I couldn't help but smirk as I saw even Tony slam his mouth shut.  Ha!  “Now,” Uncle Bucky began, “we all want answers.”  He looked at me and I couldn't help but cringe at the shaken look in his eyes.  “Peter can't answer if we're all yelling our heads off.”  Everyone else nodded reluctantly.  “So, first off.  You're Spider-Man?”  I nodded.  “Seriously?”  Tony cut in and I just nodded again.
“I wanna just chuck the damn thing into a volcano though,” Tony muttered as the three left in a hurry to grab the items that Tony had specified. Bruce raised an eyebrow at Tony but said nothing.
“Deadpool,” Tony warned with a growl. Deadpool, as usual, ignored him. “You kinda went all zombie, eat brains on us, Petey-pie.” I squeezed his hand and he returned it, thumbing over the back of my hand in an attempt to soothe me.
That was all they had to say. I trusted them. Despite what everyone said about Wade, I knew he'd be there with Matt and I knew that they would be there with me, for me. I let myself drift to sleep with two warm, strong, muscled heroes flanking either side of me. I was safe.
“Peter?” The hard voice of Daredevil made me look back at him. “Do you remember what happened?” I frowned. Well. Of course. Okay, so maybe a little less than 'of course'. There were questions. Like 'what the fuck!? Were those bent restraints on my limbs!?'
I haven't been Spider-Man since the bomb and reading Twitter messages has only made me antsy. People are wondering where Spider-Man is. I even read an article sanctioned by JJJ celebrating the possibility that Spider-Man died somewhere in a ditch and New York City is finally free of the “menace”. That guy really has some issues. Even Daredevil doesn't get this kind of bullshit attention.
I smile a little. We both know that this moment of safety isn't going to last. It could be any time when the guards return to snatch me up and drag me back to the labs, but for the moment? Letting myself fall asleep under Wade's watchful eye is comforting. For the moment, I'm okay.
“Wellz, this is all well and good,” Deadpool began before lifting me up in his arms. I squeaked, startled. “But I think Petey-pie's going to need some food and this place is starting to give me the heebie jeebies.”
My stomach churned nervously at the thought that I'd let people who had been missing me, people who needed me, down while I was recovering.
The aftertaste is somehow metallic after the sip, so I quickly just tilt my head back and slurp as much as possible until it's all gone. I gasp as I pass the bowl back to Wade, sucking in air. “Yuck,” I whine, the taste sticking to my tongue with evil hatred.
Hoping to update another fic I haven't updated in a while soon, but you never know I guess.  I hope you have a great rest of the week!
I sighed. I was starting to think that any of Tony's initial calm was more about being in shock than anything. Fury raised an eyebrow at me and I just shrugged. It was Tony. What could anyone do? He seemed to understand and smiled at me covertly.
“Did you know that there are any number of perceptions to stories. One person can see one thing, and another can see something else. It's a lot like art, in a way, I suppose. My dad, Steve, loves to paint and sketch. He's really good at it, but sometimes my other dad, Tony, can't see the same things he can,” I continued. At least I was getting the satisfaction that my chatter was annoying the not-so-good doctor.
At this point though, there was nothing in my mind but protecting my family and stopping Osborne from destroying more of my life.
“Another symbiote,” Deadpool voiced Daredevil's thoughts with a hard, cold sort of certainty that he usually reserved for jobs and for people who hurt his friends.
I quickly pull on my Spider-Man suit and throw a pair of clothes over top of it. Hey, it's a Saturday. And I did my homework. I have more than enough free time to scour the city as Spider-Man. But before I left, I realized I should probably go see if Tony and Steve are awake and if Fury's had a talk with them. I check my room and make sure I have everything I need. Good thing I do. And now… Let's see who's up.
“Well if he didn't see,” Steve teased. “Come here, Peter,” he said, wrapping his arm around my middle and the other under my legs. I whined childishly but let him pick me up, turning my face into his chest.
I jerked back, only to whack my head with a thud that would've made the Hulk proud on a metal table. 'Fuck fuck shit shit,' was all I could think through the pain. I groaned loudly, unable to stop the pain from showing.
I looked towards Bruce, pushing down my fear and pain. “My blood..” I cleared my throat when it came out hoarse and like the call of a dying cat. “What's it look like?”
There's a slight twinge in my chest and then it feels like I'm being crushed under a semi again. My free hand flies to my chest, nails digging into it as my breath stutters. “Shit,” someone swears.
I can’t wait to see what you guys think!  Please don’t forget to hit the kudos button and leave me a comment! 💗
"Thanks, J," Tony murmured as Peter came up next to him, a pair of noise-cancelling headphones clutched in one hand and a pen in the other.
Tony watched as Steve's already pale face paled even more. "Well, it's my real name on that list, and Bucky's, and even Peter's… it even says Peter Stark-Rogers instead of Peter Stark, so… there's no harm in trying."
Gangrene, Uncle Bucky had called it.  Tissue death caused by a lack of blood supply, often accompanied by severe infection.
"That would be helpful," said Steve. "Even if his memories were tampered with, there still might be something there that could be useful."
"And I can verify that that is indeed the case," Gwen said with a short laugh. "My dad says the red cars are just easier to pick out on the roads, especially when they're speeding."
He hears a sigh, which no doubt is accompanied by one of his father’s famous eyerolls, followed by footsteps on the wooden hallway floor as they approach his bedroom.
"This is… really nice!" Gwen stated as she worked her way down the food line, taking a bit of everything as Peter piled his plate high with shrimp, meatballs, and wings. "You sure seem like you're hungry!"
"That's just so weird that your security systems were breached again, don't you think?" asked Ned. "I mean, if it was the same space aliens that attacked New York that one time, you would think that they would've attacked something more important, right? Like the White House or the Pentagon or something? Or do you think it's just 'cause they're still holding a grudge?"
“Well, then I’ll be looking forward to it,” Steve said, his grip on his belt loosening slightly.  “Now, would you happen to need any bookmarks to go with your new books?”
Almost immediately Peter felt his cheeks blushing pink, and he let out a soft cough as he nodded. "Thanks," he said. "Papa… he's a big fan of plaid, my dad really likes it on him so he wears it a lot, and since he's the one who usually takes me shopping, he thought it'd be nice, so—"
"It's a wonder that he's lived this long given the heart defects that he has," the doctor continued. "He's a pretty remarkable young man."
Tony raised his hand, cutting him off.  “Steve, I had a great time too,” he whispered.  “I just didn't want you to feel pressured to come over again tomorrow if you didn't want to.”
"Yes, dear, I know that," Maria said softly, her fingers curling around Howard's hand. "But right now I don't really think that information is going to help Tony sleep through the night, so—"
"I think we do, Mr Lang," Steve said as Tony shook Lang's hand. "There's nothing wrong with giving someone a second chance, as I'm sure Mr Pym tried to explain to you. But those second chances should never lead you right back into what got you into trouble in the first place, as I'm sure you'll now agree."
The sound of a clearing throat broke them apart, and Steve looked up to see Clint, smirking in the doorway of the jet as he fiddled with one of his arrowheads.
"Oh, yeah. Sorry," Ned said with a wince. "But still! You're gonna have all these cool personal first-hand accounts of stuff in your essay, and no one else will!"
Steve pursed his lips as he swung his shield at yet another Chitauri warrior, knocking him into a group of three who were aiming some kind of RPG-like thing at Scott as he ambled by.
The extra-atmospheric engine on the X-302 aircraft had been designed specifically to function during the normal aircraft takeoff procedures. Tony had calculated the time to ignite the third engine down to the millisecond with JARVIS's help, and it had functioned perfectly in every single one of the simulator sessions.
Tony huffed as he nodded, quirking an eyebrow at Steve. "Yeah, okay bud. Go on and brush your teeth."
he thinks as he closes his eyes again, shivering as a single tear drips down the side of his nose.  He wants to tell Tony how sorry he is.  He wants to blurt out everything he’s been bottling up inside for over two years simply because he’s “stubborn as hell”, as Tony would say.
"Yeah, but… honey, even if Bruce and I could figure this out, that doesn't mean it's gonna work," Tony said, his voice quivering slightly. "And if we try, and then it doesn't—Steve, I don't—I don't think I could—"
The two relay medals that flank his individual medal look identical, but Steve can still tell the difference between them.  And while he does cherish the medals and the experiences he had participating on those relays, they just don’t hold as high of a place in Steve’s heart as his own.
"Are you ready to go check out the telescope now?" he asked as they gathered up their dishes. "I thought we could take some hot chocolate up there with us."
"All right. And do you have any new theories as to what they might've been doing here?" Steve asked.
"Okay, Mr Stark, I think I almost have it here," Gwen said, squinting at Peter's computer screen from her seat on the floor of Tony's lab. "It looks like Peter was trying to observe something along this part of the Georgia coastline, but I can't be sure exactly what he was looking at."
"Hey buddy!" Tony said as Peter stepped inside, a wide smile stretched across his round face. "Have a good day?"
"Oh!" Tony said on a gasp as his eyes swept across his husband, as tall and strong and beautiful as ever. A second later his legs gave way underneath him and Steve rushed forward, lifting Tony into his arms.
At first Tony shook his head, still working the logistics through his mind. Finally, he snapped his fingers.
Steve simply had to assume that they were okay. Otherwise, there would be no way he'd be able to lead the team through what they'd likely be facing once they arrived in Wakanda.
"Peter!" Papa screamed as Peter felt his eyes roll back into his head, his frozen hands slipping from their hold on the ship as all the remaining air in his lungs dissipated in one fell swoop, and everything went dark.
The warmth that had been bubbling around inside Tony’s chest like a jacuzzi suddenly spiked, almost as if the arc reactor was overloading.  Every time Steve said those words to him, it was as if Tony was hearing them for the very first time, complete with a replay of all of the shock, awe, and disbelief.
The thought of sleeping, or even trying to sleep, or even thinking of trying to sleep while Peter was sick… well… it was ridiculous, is what it was.
At least that's what Colonel Phillips was always saying, according to the briefing reports that Tony had to read through every single day, and he was pretty sure that Rhodey spouted something similar to the hordes of cadets that came through the flight training school every six months.
Tony thought angrily.  He did wonder from time to time whatever had happened to her after she abandoned Peter at the hospital, but since Tony honestly didn't know what he’d do if he ever came across her again, he figured it was probably for the best that he didn't.
I have several new stories in the works.  I’ll be posting in the IronDadRemix event this coming Thursday, as well in the StonyLovesSteve and Superfamily exchange events.  I’m also participating in the StarSpangled Big Bang, and have both another SamBucky fic and an Everlark fic in the works, so you haven’t heard the last of me 😉
Tony wondered. He didn't dare say it out loud, though. Steve's mood was already tenuous enough, and he didn't feel like getting into yet another argument.
"Copy that." Tony sighed as he rechecked his brand-new data pad, glancing over at Colonel Phillips who was leaning back in his chair about two metres away. Rhodey and Captain Wilson were also present in what Tony had named the Control Room, sitting off to the side.
"Yeah, yeah, hon," Tony said, rather dismissively. "You'd better get going and feed the kid, I'm sure Pete's trying to gnaw his own arm off by now."
as Sam come to an abrupt landing about a metre behind him and assumed the rest of the team was also falling in, already scanning their surroundings for a possible way out.
A ring that Steve was so afraid he might misplace—the fact that he had never misplaced anything was completely beside the point—that he currently had it on his person, hidden in the little secret compartment Tony had built into his uniform for the small sketchbook and pencil he always carried.  Steve supposed he could have left it in his small, barebones Tower apartment since Tony never went down there, but since he had carried it with him ever since he’d picked it up from the jeweller, he hadn't wanted to leave it behind.
"We're with you, Stevie," said Bucky. "Or at least as much as we can be." He dropped his chin to his chest, shaking his head. "Yesterday I got a call from some staffer assigned to one of O'Brien's inner circle, who proceeded to tell me that since I was injured on a mission that wasn't associated with either the protection or the defence of Langara, that I wouldn't qualify for the compensation fund for injured pilots."
"Then you should be able to?" Gwen said eagerly, sending another rush of warmth across Peter's chest. After the whole peppermint incident Dad and Papa had flat-out refused to allow Peter to go back to Gwen's house, and while they had been able to see each other a couple of times over Christmas break, it was always at the Tower under the watchful eyes of Papa, Dad, and JARVIS, which didn't allow for very many opportunities for much of anything besides some accidental-on-purpose knee touching and elbow rubbing. They had exchanged Christmas presents, with Peter giving Gwen one of the brand-new StarkPens for her tablet and Gwen presenting Peter with an incredible model replica of the original Starship Enterprise, but that had been pretty much it.
"What?" Tony exclaimed, wincing as a hot bolt of pain shot up his left arm. "Up at the Compound? But that's supposed to be impossible!"
"Wanda might be needed to help protect the Soul Stone if the enemy ends up finding it," added Steve. "And Pietro, I'd like you to keep your eyes open for anyone wounded. If you see someone go down, you get out there and get 'em to safety. Got it?"
Apparently, Obie had now decided that it was Tony who was responsible for the fact that when Regina Williams, Peter’s mother, started working for Stark Industries, she had been sent there as a spy.  By none other than Justin Hammer.  The most assholery asshole who’d ever assholed.
“So, do you wanna talk about it?” Tony asked once Steve’s breathing was back to normal.  “I don't know if that usually helps you or not, but—”
"I can't, sweetheart," Steve finally whispered. "I can't—I can't relax, not now, not with everything, and I'll only keep you awake. You go ahead, you need the sleep more than I do."
As he starts to swim, Peter wonders why the thought never occurred to him to try out for a swimming team.  He’s always enjoyed the sport, and was bummed when he completed all of his lessons because it meant he didn't have a good excuse to go to the pool anymore.  He still goes with Ned sometimes in the summers, and occasionally Uncle Happy and Aunt Pepper will take him swimming at the pool in their apartment building, but never anything more than that.
Tony grinned as he brushed Steve's soaked bangs from his forehead. "Well… since this is your show tonight, why don't you tell me what you want, hmm?"
"That's 'cause he did, honey. Just like you saved both of us when you found us in that desert. Pete would've been dead if you hadn't shown up when you did."
"Okay, well, I think Betty's waiting for me, we're gonna go get some ice cream," said Ned as the other students headed for the exit. "So I guess I'll see ya tomorrow?"
"Uhh, you too?" Peter cringed as Dad shot Uncle Thor a downright murderous look, causing him to sputter as he pushed Peter back to his spot.
Tony's eyebrows shot up at Wilson's remarks. For someone who'd been in the running to fly the Phoenix missions as well, he definitely didn't seem like he was bitter about the fact that he hadn't qualified.
"Steve," Tony whimpered, his fingers fisting into Steve’s t-shirt. "Honey, we can't—we can't lose him. Not now, not after—"
"Bruce is right, Steve," Sam spoke up before Steve could even react. "And you know he's just stating facts here, right?"
"No, that's okay. You don't have to tell me," Steve said. He'd learned pretty quickly once he and Tony started dating that Tony's clearance level regarding certain things was even higher than his, and the last thing he wanted was to possibly get Tony into trouble for divulging things he wasn't supposed to.
"Okay, but then you'd better put a lid on it for a while," said Tony. "'Cause if you're still trying to convince me that you're not perfect, well… I hate to tell you this,
"Well… once Hank explained that it was him who'd been behind the whole thing, he took me into his secret lab inside his house and offered me the chance to see my daughter again."
"Well… I kinda already asked her," Peter said, rather sheepishly. "And her mom and dad both said it was fine since Uncle Thor was gonna be with us."
Peter wasn't about to tell Dad about it, though. There was already enough bad blood between the two of them.
Hank Pym, a man Tony had grown up despising thanks to Howard's influence, had felt it necessary to essentially blackmail some no-name cat burglar into trying to steal from the Avengers' Compound.
"Tony! Peter!" he exclaimed as he took a tentative step towards him, his heart twisting when Tony shook his head, tucking Peter behind him as they both stepped back, almost like they were afraid of him.
“Okay, so… we just station Barton up in a tree by the tower and let him pick ‘em off, two by two?” asks Tony.  “Seems simple enough.”
"Oh, thank you, Mr Stark!" Ned said with a wide smile, adjusting the brown fedora perched on his round head as he and Peter climbed out of the car. "It gives me confidence!"
"We think so," answered Natasha. She tapped the keyboard again, bringing up another photograph. "This is Morris Bench. He was the second name we decrypted in Mongolia, and from what we've been able to find, he was one of the crew members on the Lemurian Star, which in addition to launching the satellites that were part of Project Insight was also rumoured to be testing some sort of experimental generator."
He just needed to get it out in the open, which meant telling Tony the truth and then hoping for the best. Based on what Peter had told him it seemed as though Tony felt the same way about him as he did about Tony, so maybe once Steve finally talked to him about it everything would be fine.
Tony huffed as he captured Steve's lips again, his tongue briefly sweeping inside, tangling with Steve's.
Finally, after Tony dropped all sense of propriety and flat-out informed Cam and John that it was time for them to leave, Steve made sure all of the doors to the house were locked and grabbed Tony's hand, practically dragging him up the stairs and into their bedroom, barely getting the door closed behind them before claiming Tony's mouth.
Peter nodded miserably, his hands twisting in his lap as he proceeded to tell Tony that he had been secretly decoding their HYDRA files in his room at night ever since he had discovered the bill containing the Registration Act. It was all Tony could do to stay quiet while Peter explained what he had uncovered, his fingers wrapped so tightly around his left forearm that he could feel bruises forming.
That was Steve-code for 'get ready to pack him off to Asgard', but at the moment Tony was too upset to think of much of anything besides getting his husband out of the vile clutches of the three HYDRA agents standing in front of him.
"Peter, I'm pretty sure they already know that," Uncle Bucky interrupted. "But since Steve's controls are completely useless, he can't do a damn thing except sit there and watch the planet go by beneath him. And he's still okay at the moment, but if he gets much colder—"
"Which I completely agree with," Tony said. "Hell, there's no telling what that kid would be out there doing without us putting our foot down all the damn time. But honey, I don't think we can tell him no here, I just don't. If we try this experiment on Bucky and it works, then Pete should have the option of trying it too. He deserves to be free of HYDRA's poison."
"And I always swore that I'd never fall in love because I was too afraid to get my heart broken," said Steve. "That's what happened to my ma, and it almost destroyed her." He kissed the back of Tony's hand, cradling it against his cheek. "I tried really hard to ignore you at first, tried telling myself that it was your father's fault that my papa was killed, anything to keep from falling for you. But none of it worked. I couldn't've stopped it if I tried."
"Ah, yeah, I was just coming in to peek at you," Tony murmured as he smoothed Steve's bangs from his forehead, his heart fluttering at the sheer amount of gorgeousness emanating from him, even in his barely-awake, disheveled state.
Tony thought, sniffing as a tear rolled down his cheek. The exact words he had used when he'd explained Peter's condition to Tony.
"I'll talk to him after dinner tonight, okay?" said Steve. "Are you thinking sometime this weekend for the experiment?"
to me about something that's really important, and that's not something that good relationships are usually built on."
Peter sucked in a deep breath as he knocked on the thick wooden door that led into Pepper's office, the office he'd spent so much of his life in when he was little. Not wanting to be away from him most of the time, Dad had set up an entire mini-nursery on one side of the massive room, complete with crib, rocking chair, cordoned-off play area, mini fridge and microwave for his bottles and food, and enough toys and books for probably three kids. Peter had spent at least part of almost every single day there until he was old enough to start school, and then after school he would usually hang out in there again until Dad was done working and they could go home.
"If you say so, bud," said Dad. He jerked his head towards Peter's notebook. "You've got some more code for me to go through?"
"The—the Wakandans," he said after he'd taken three tentative steps. The cries from the distant battlefield had all but ceased, but he still didn't feel comfortable just leaving without at least exchanging… What was the opposite of pleasantries? Insults? No, that was definitely not it. Remorse?
And not that Peter needed a mother. Both Tony and Steve had certain qualities that he supposed could be considered mother-like, so it wasn't like Peter was missing out on anything. But Tony also knew that sometimes it was just nice for Peter to have a female perspective and influence in a family otherwise full of men.
Both of which were impossible, from how Peter saw it. Even if they had somehow managed to observe Papa reentering the atmosphere, Captain Barnes's reentry point wasn't the same as Papa's, so firing at Papa's reentry point wouldn't have resulted in anything besides a really bright light and a bunch of frightened birds.
Tony breathed a sigh of relief.  At least one of his most important employees believed he was doing the right thing, and he had little doubt that Happy would agree with Pepper.
"I wasn't hiding it, Steve," Tony mumbled into his chest. "You were in no condition to hear it when I found out, and then… well… we needed that trip, honey. We needed that trip to be as relaxing as possible, and I didn't want it hanging over our heads the whole time."
The only thing missing was the medallion he'd been wearing around his neck, the medallion he had revealed had contained the Time Stone.
A knot the size of a marble rose in Tony's throat. Sometimes the selflessness of his son shocked even him.
Not that he ever would.  First, Dad would never do that to his employees, and he’s way too much of a workaholic to even think about taking a day off.  Peter’s lucky when he gets him to stay home from the shop on Sundays, only for him to spend the entire day working on the massive computer program that occupies just about every single one of his waking minutes.

Tony pursed his lips, glancing at Steve over Peter's head. "All right, big guy, go ahead and activate the interface."
"Okay, okay, just… slow down for a second, please?" Steve asked. He sucked in a slow, deep breath, taking a sip of his tea. "What does Wakanda have to do with your bad dreams?"
“But, Dad, you promised you’d be able to pick me up on time today!” Peter said, glancing furtively around his locker to make sure he hadn't been overheard.  Seeing as it was almost ninety minutes after the final bell, he probably didn't have to worry much.  Most of the students were long gone, with the few remaining still engrossed in their chess clubs or shop class projects, where they probably wouldn’t be able to hear him anyway.
"Papa!" Peter yelled, turning in shock as the prison suddenly disappeared and he found himself standing alone in what looked like a very old graveyard. "Papa? What's happening to me?"
"You're what I deserve, mo grá," Steve murmured as his fingers wrapped around Tony's cock, stroking him as another spike of heat raced across Tony's body. Whenever they fucked like this, Steve always made it a personal mission to ensure that Tony came as close to him as possible.
"Oh, yeah," replied Steve, plastering on a smile he had no doubt that Carol could see right through. "Just a bit tired, you know? I was at Ma's all last weekend trying to help her out. Her arthritis has been flaring up a bit again, so I've been trying to fix up some stuff around her house to help make things easier on her."
Once he was showered and dressed, Steve headed back to the kitchen to find Tony helping Peter with the last of his snacks. With Peter's metabolism almost twice that of a normal sixteen-year-old boy, most of the time his daily food intake surpassed even Steve's, and he and Tony had already had to bring him extra food during the day three times since the beginning of the school year.
"No, it never has," Peter said firmly. "And the first time I ever noticed it was around a HYDRA agent, remember?"
Even Colonel Phillips had asked for a Peter Stark-Rogers original, which Peter had already sketched out and received approval from the colonel. An X-302 with its nose pointed up, overlaid with a phoenix.
Shaking his head clear of thoughts of blue eyes and broad shoulders—and don't even get him started on those sinfully kissable
Switching off the receiver, Peter placed it on his bedside table and grabbed his notebook, laying back against his pillows. A proud smile stretched across his lips as he flipped through the pages, landing on the lines of code he'd just completed earlier that day.
"No, no, you know that nothing at work is more important than you, Pete," Tony said firmly. "And I can handle the stress just fine. It's you that I'm worried about."
"That was kind of the point, sweetheart," Steve said, with a downright mischievous wink. "JARVIS, is Peter still awake?"
"There's a toothbrush and razor for you by the sink," Steve said once he'd finished tying his shoes. He sat down on the bed, trailing his fingers along Tony's jawline. "And I'll bring back some breakfast for you too, okay?"
"But I thought you guys already had a ship?" Sam asked. "Isn't that how you got here in the first place?"
"Mr Stark! Mr Stark! How many total credits were spent on Project Phoenix? Did the Meridian government cover any of the cost?"
In fact, Tony was going to make sure of it. Just to prove O'Brien and all of his discriminatory fuckers wrong.
"Yeah, but that's what makes her such a damn good pilot," said Wilson. "Gods know she's had to work her ass off to get where she is."
"But that can mean a lot of things," Steve said quickly, his mind racing with all of the various possibilities. Peter's absence could simply mean that instead of leaving the schoolbus transporting him to his museum field trip that morning, he had stayed put when the alien's ship had arrived, knowing that his dads wouldn't want him placing himself in unnecessary danger.
"No, no, I'd love to see the tree in your backyard, little guy," Steve said. He leaned back in his chair, resting his sketchbook on his knee like he always did. "Ready?"
Steve leaned back against the elevator wall as it began its ascent up to the topmost floor of the Tower. He hadn't wanted to get into it with Sam right after their run, but he was really starting to worry about Tony. Ever since they'd returned from their late summer vacation to Ireland, Steve had noticed that Tony's sleep was getting worse. It didn't help that his own sleep still wasn't all that great, often filled with horrifying images of him battling Tony hand-to-hand as Tony mercilessly taunted him, images he knew were the result of his torture at HYDRA's hands. Sam had told him multiple times that it would take some time for those images to fade, and perhaps even longer due to his eidetic memory, but Steve wasn't concerned about himself. As much as Tony tried to deny it, he was suffering, and Steve was at a loss as to how to help him. As it was, Tony had spent a good portion of their sleeping time working in his lab after being awoken by yet another bad dream, only returning to the bed after Steve had begged him, telling him that he couldn't sleep well without him. It was the truth; Steve never slept well without Tony next to him, but he still felt guilty about it. Both he and Tony had fallen into some pretty bad coping habits following the battle in the Miami bunker, and Steve was afraid that he and Tony were starting to slip right back into those patterns.
A knot rose in Tony's throat as Bucky's piercing eyes locked with his through the window, with Bucky giving him an almost imperceptible nod.
But then, to Steve's abject horror, only a split-second before the blade would have pierced Thanos' purple flesh, it was knocked away, embedding itself into the trunk of a distant tree with a loud
"Nothing wrong with protecting a kid," Bucky said as they exited the locker room. "I had plenty of practise protecting you, didn't I?"
horrific day, when he woke up to find himself lying flat on his face on a hard, smelly cot and Yinsen stitching the back of his head back together with a sewing needle,
Tony sniffed, kissing the top of Peter's head. "Next week, once I'm done with all of the space-flight simulator programs."
“So… do you think this time will work out okay for you guys?” he finally asks.  “I know Peter mentioned something about it maybe being a bit tight, so—”
"Thank you, Papa," Peter murmured. "This is perfect." While the hoodie was still a very poor substitute for one of his father's hugs, it would do well enough until he could come back.
The fact that the U.S. was literally built on the backs of immigrants seemed to escape the President's thought process, something that both Dad and Papa felt very strongly about since they were both descendants of immigrants. Peter had heard the stories about Grandpa Howard's father more times than he could count, and Papa had also told him a few about when his own father came over from Ireland, trying to escape the turmoil resulting from the harsh discriminatory policies of Great Britain against the country.
Peter gave a short nod.  “Uh huh.  Will you text me once you talk to him?  Tell me how he’s doing?  I really want to go there after school, but I wanna make sure he’s okay first.”
"Well, if that's what it takes to keep you with me, then so be it," Steve said. "I'll take that chance."
" Tony said, delighting in the light pink blush that worked its way up Steve's cheeks. "Do enlighten us, hmm?"
"Well, then it's about damn time that he left you alone," Dad grumbled. "It's only taken it how long to get through his thick head?"
Outside of Peter's door, Steve raised his hand to knock, then hesitated. For some reason it seemed almost wrong for him to be there, to be grateful that a kid was sick just to satisfy his apparently inherent need to pretend that he was someone important in that kid's life for a few hours per week.
"You—you look really pretty tonight," Peter whispered to Gwen as Ned's guess of Colonel Mustard in the parlor with the candlestick was quickly shot down by Betty. She was wearing a bright blue sweater that complimented her blonde hair and green eyes beautifully.
"I know," Steve answered, sniffing as a large bead of water rolled down the bridge of his nose. He quickly brushed it away, turning Tony back around while still keeping his palm over Tony's heart, his free hand tracing the chain holding his dog tags before moving down to splay across Tony's abdomen, his lips brushing along Tony's jaw and neck.
"That's correct," Tony said. "All right then, Captain Rogers, why don't you tell me what'll happen if you try and come in too late?"
They ended up working late into the night, until Peter's eyelids grew so heavy that he could no longer keep them open and Tony insisted that they needed to let him get some sleep. By the time he and Tony had tucked Peter into bed and kissed him goodnight it was well after 2300 hours, and while the almost overwhelming anguish that had been hanging across Steve's shoulders like a lead veil ever since that morning had lessened a bit, his heart was still heavy with worry.
"No one in particular," Gwen said quickly. "I've just heard people talking about how you missed like a bunch of school last year because your dads had to send you to a safehouse somewhere while they were on a mission."
"Um, hi," Peter said with a rather awkward smile. "I'm Peter Stark-Rogers, and this is my dad. He's Iron Man."
"Gotta take the tiny victories when we can get 'em, honey," Tony said. "And yes, Pete is visually accounted for and out like a light." He slipped his hands underneath Steve's t-shirt, gliding them up his back and causing Steve to shiver. "Now, I finally got Sam's new pack and Clint's new bow up to snuff, and I think I'd like to take a shower. Would you care to join me,
"Which is why it would help if Mr Wizard here could just teleport us there instead!" Tony stated. He picked up a small rock and launched it towards Strange, grimacing as it hit some sort of personal deflection shield and bounced harmlessly away.
Turning back to his image self, Papa pursed his lips, concentrating as the rest of the people got up from their chairs and filed out of the room.
"The sceptre!" Peter exclaimed, immediately clapping his hand over his mouth. Neither Uncle Sam or Auntie Nat had super hearing, but it still wouldn't do him any good to push things.
Tony’s so entranced by the sheer perfection displayed on the screen in front of him that at least three minutes go by before he realises that Steve has won his race and the video is over.  Swallowing against his dry mouth, Tony clicks on the third video, his heart giving a hard lurch at the razor-sharp contrast in Steve’s demeanour.  Gone is the cheery, kind of
"Tony, Tony, Tony!" Steve whispered as Tony's movements slowly grew faster, unable to form any other words. Because there were no words, no way to describe how unbelievable Tony's body felt wrapped around him, closing around him like he wanted to keep him inside and never let go.
With a heavy sigh, Peter archived the file and selected the next, promising himself that this would the the last one he'd do for the night.
"Oh." Peter had to admit that he hadn't thought of it quite like that, and it did make a lot of sense. "You think so?"
It didn't help that Peter had never told Gwen that he'd actually got captured down in that Georgia prison, and that he'd had to beg Wanda Maximoff to help him escape before Dad and the rest of the team got there.
“And what makes you so goddamn sure that he’s still even there?” demanded Tony.  “For all we know, he could be anywhere by now?”
"Yes, it can," said Mr Clean, completely serious. "Thanos used it to make Knowhere look like a palace in order to trick us."
Tony groaned, scrubbing at his eyes with his palm. "And you didn't tell me about this, why, exactly?"
Tony couldn't seem to help it, though. Not when he could no longer convince himself that Rogers' meaningful glances were just accidents. Or that Rogers seemed to go out of his way to praise every single thing that he did.
Good thing he always left plenty of lines between items, or he would’ve had to rewrite the entire thing.
"You're welcome, little guy," Papa said as he handed Dad one of his weird-looking green smoothies. "And Uncle Sam and Uncle Bucky are coming over in a few minutes to watch a movie with us, does that sound okay?"
"Yes, sir," said Steve. "I've been cleared by the base medical office and I'm ready to resume my duties."
. And when the dust had finally settled from the fierce battle that had followed, and his heroic son had once again freed him from his prison, Peter's very first words to him were, "Papa, it's me! Everything's gonna be okay now!"
Since when had O'Brien ever referred to his inner governmental circle as his ‘parliament’? In all of his years with the Air Corps and before that as a civilian, Steve had never before heard him use that term.
Peter watched as Dad and Papa exchanged one of their eyebrow-quirking looks. "Nothing much yet, bud," said Dad. "Like I said, there's a ton of data here but it's all locked up pretty tight, so we're gonna be working on it for awhile once we get back."
"Oh, Christ," Steve heard Sam mutter as he took off, leaping onto the tank just as Rumlow was preparing to fire again. He swung his shield, intending to strike Rumlow in the head as Rumlow raised his right arm to block the blow, landing a hard punch to Steve's abdomen with his left. Steve grunted as he fell sideways from the tank, managing to right himself just in time to land on his feet. Both of Rumlow's forearms were covered in thick, metal gauntlets, not too unlike the first few versions of Tony's gauntlets, and sounded exactly like the old WWII HYDRA weapons as they charged.
“No!” Steve cried, followed directly on its heels by a burst of such intense pain that he felt like his entire nervous system was overloading.  Chills raced down his spine, spreading down his limbs at a rapidly increasing rate, almost as though his very own heartbeat was fuelling them.
"Don't have to tell me twice," Tony said, just before Peter poked his head up from his arm, his nose scrunched up in disgust.
"Agreed," said Tony. He was starting to feel claustrophobic anyway, stuck inside yet another dank, dark, concrete and stone HYDRA bunker. And what was it about all the HYDRA bunkers being so grey and dark, anyway? Whoever designed their fortresses sure had a severe lack of imagination. Hadn't they ever heard of colours? Or windows?
"Here you are, young man. I hope you have fun at your prom!" the cashier said as she handed Peter the plastic box containing Gwen's corsage, a bright pink tulip accented with baby's breath and some green fern-looking plant that would coordinate with Gwen's emerald green dress beautifully.
"Will you let us know once he's out of surgery?" Tony asked. "After you're all settled, of course. I'd… I'm betting that there'll be something I can do that might be able to help, so…"
"You do?" Peter asked, wincing as soon as the words left his mouth. He was in her house, after all, and if she wanted to sit and watch him eat while pretending to read, then she had every right to do so.
"Yeah, that was probably smart," Natasha said, raising her eyebrows as Scott went to work trying to peel the banana. "So… you mentioned something about the Quantum Realm? Can you tell us a bit more about that?"
Tony winced. He'd noticed lately that Steve had been finding Tony's frequent jokes about his perfection less and less amusing, and so had been trying to cut back on them. But it'd been a lot harder than he'd thought since to him, Steve really
"Mmm. Well, I sure hope whoever it is is smarter than the last civvy we had. Remember that guy who they had a couple years ago? The dude who didn't know his own head from his ass?"
And what lay beneath those linens. His long, lean legs. His absolutely magnificent ass, so gorgeous it would make Michelangelo jealous.
If Peter hadn’t come along a few months later, Tony might’ve even been able to eventually drink enough Scotch to convince himself that Regina had been nothing more than a product of his overactive imagination.  But with the sudden appearance of his very real baby son, Tony’s entire life was radically changed.
"All right. Go ahead and run one more diagnostic and then get it uploaded, yeah? Both mine and Rhodey's suits."
"I know he needs time," Steve whispered. "I'm just… it's just so hard to see him like this. I thought this would stop once we removed the Winter Soldier programming from his mind."
"Tony, I need you and the flyers to start taking out the rest of the Chitauri guarding Thanos," ordered Steve. "We need to get him isolated."
Twenty-eight years of rationing everything from electricity to certain foods to coffee in order to funnel as much as possible into the military, and subsequently treating civilians as second-class citizens.
Tony breathed. "You have no idea just how sexy that is, do you? I mean, there's just no way that you could possibly know, because—"
"Oh, hey there, tiny DUM-E," Peter softly said as DUM-E let out another distressed warble. "Don't worry, we'll get you back to normal in a sec, okay?"
Grandma blinked, her eyes narrowing just like Papa's did when he was puzzled. "And how'd you guess that, hmm?"
Just then one of the brightest bolts of lightning Steve had ever seen lit up the sky around them, accompanied by a shocked, "Holy
"Please, Thor, continue," said Steve, barely clinging to his patience. "We're kind of on the clock here."
Tony shook his head, gripping his left forearm so tightly that his knuckles were white. "I'm sorry, Mr Beck, but I'm afraid I'm going to have to tell you to suspend all further experiments with that drug until further notice. I'll continue to study your holographic technology, but I want the complete supply of that drug brought to Pepper Potts' office within fifteen minutes from the conclusion of this meeting. Is that clear?"
“Yes, please!” Peter said eagerly.  “And I think you should come inside too.  It’s such a cool store, Dad, and I’m sure Steve would love to meet you!”
He trailed off as Dad looked up at him, starting a bit as if he'd just noticed that he was there, his eyes red-rimmed and bloodshot and so full of terror and anger that Peter had to look away, ashamed.
"Oh," Peter said. Papa and Dad had told Peter about his super soldier experiment a couple of weeks ago, something that Peter had to admit he found incredibly cool. "Well, that's good, but… but
It was also a project that Obie had no clue existed, as Tony had kept all of his tinkering on it off of the main Stark Industries servers.  Only the pharmaceutical scientists, himself, and Peter were aware of its existence.
"Yeah, yeah," Tony said as he scrubbed his palm down his face. "The theory is that he wouldn't have to hold the weight for much longer than that, but… what would happen if we increased the density of the titanium in the alloy mixture by five percent?"
Dad rushed out.  Peter sat up straighter as all of the blood drained from Dad’s cheeks.  “Pete, I think I know what’s going on.”
“Monday morning, bud, all right?” said Dad.  “As soon as I drop you off at school.  I just… wanna make sure I’ve got all my ducks in row with this rifle and bullet stuff first.”
Tony's heart stuttered at the mention of his father, his fingers tightening around the air canister. "Yeah, Steve's told me that story," he said shortly. "You remember it, eh?"
DUM-E squeaked, obviously already over the entire thing, but it was so soft and high-pitched that Peter doubted Dad could even hear him.
It wasn't exactly the same. The pitch was just a touch lower and the timbre just slightly… off, likely due to compression by his ancient workstation, but it still sounded so much like him it was as though he'd been raised from the dead.
The amount of lighting and electricity that Steve's four teammates launched at the creature was so bright and so strong that the medical equipment inside the Suburban actually blew out, requiring Bruce to hook up the auxiliary power. Squinting, Steve watched as the monster let out a final bellowing roar before exploding, showering the entire lake and the surrounding shoreline with icy water.
"Yes, yes, that is indeed why I'm here," Thor said. He turned to Steve, his expression rather grim. "Captain, it is my understanding that you are departing for Africa at this very moment?"
"And I'm gonna head down and start on some contingency plans," said Sam. "Nat, you and Clint gonna head out in the morning?"
"This is definitely quite the place you've got here," Tony said the evening before they were set to leave, as he, Steve, and T'Challa strolled around the palace grounds following their evening meal. "I guess I can understand why you guys would wanna keep it hidden away."
"So, uh… Стиви? How'd you know where this thing was?" Bucky asked, his rifle at the ready. So far no one in Thanos' army had seemed to notice what they were doing, but Steve knew it was only a matter of seconds before that changed.
But this nightmare had been different. This time, there had been no words for Tony to scream, and no breath in his lungs with which to scream them, and as such, it was taking Steve a few extra seconds to catch on.
Steve let out a heavy sigh, scrubbing his palm down his prickly face. He'd have to shave before Tony came home, or he would never hear the end of it.
The air temp inside the car seemed to have risen at least ten degrees over the course of their conversation, partially fogging up Tony's glasses and making him feel as though the walls were closing in. Sitting inside a parked car out in the rain was not the ideal place to be having such an intense conversation.
"Okay, well, on that note, I think I've got a plan. Or at least the beginnings of one," he said. "You wanna gather your people around?"
“If it helps at all, I actually googled Tony Stark when I got home last night,” says Natasha.  “I knew I knew his name from somewhere, but I couldn't figure out where I'd heard it before.”
Steve dropped his head, his Adam's apple bobbing as he swallowed. "Yeah, I guess. Pretty stupid, huh?"
"Boom, asshole!" Quill said as he flipped Thanos the bird, back diving into one of Dr Strange's portals just before the device exploded. Peter quickly took advantage of Thanos' disorientation to jump through another portal, bringing both of his feet down onto his head.
"Sorry kid," the thing suddenly said, his eerie voice sending another freezing bolt down Peter's spine. "But this party's over."
"Yeah," Peter answered, his eyes just as wide, which he quickly realised wasn't such a good idea given how scratchy they were. He squeezed them closed, rubbing them with one hand as he fumbled in his backpack for his glasses.
"And he wasn't gonna give it to one now, hmm?" Tony cut in. "Yeah, that sounds exactly like Pym, that old son of a bitch."
"Oh shit, baby," Tony groaned as he clenched down hard around Steve, his fingernails digging into the hard muscles of Steve's shoulder. "I can't—I'm gonna—
Since Steve had decided to forgo his usual morning run that day, he and Tony took their time in the shower, washing each other's hair and body as their hands slid and stroked and their lips kissed across each other's skin, bringing each other to one final climax before they were chased out by a group of arriving backup night-shift pilots. Back in their room, they took their time getting ready, with Steve almost hyper aware that it could very well be the last time that he dressed in the Langaran Air Corps colours.
"I love you, Tony," he whispered, leaning over to capture Tony's lips in a hard kiss. Then he lined himself up and began pushing inside him, careful to take it slow despite Tony trying to hurry him. Once he was fully sheathed he paused for a moment, his eyes squeezing closed as he sucked in a few deep breaths, taking in the incredible sight, smell and feel of his husband's—his
Suppressing a shudder, Peter stepped up to the window, placing his palms against it. The Hammer suits had all taken off after Dad and Uncle James, but just in the last minute or so he could hear them returning, apparently trying to track down the ground personnel still inside the building.
But apparently the twins, and Clint and Natasha, were settling in pretty well up at the Compound. The four of them had spent most of the summer on Clint's sister-in-law's farm in Indiana, returning to the Compound just before the start of the school year. Since upstate New York was a lot more like Indiana than Manhattan was, the team had decided that it would be best for Clint and Nat to take up year-round residence at the Compound so the twins could attend school up there.
was now in possession of the very same particles that Howard had tried his damndest to replicate before Hank Pym's dramatic departure from SHIELD. And given the combined brainpower between Bruce, Peter, and himself, Tony had little doubt that they would be able to eventually crack the formula and produce their own.
Finally, James spoke up. "Well, there's no time like the present, right? So unless you think we need more training, which we don't, by the way, then I say we go tomorrow."
He couldn't imagine how difficult it must have been for Ma to discover Peter unconscious when she'd already been so worried about him being stranded in space, but Steve knew she would eventually be fine. Ma was one of the strongest people Steve had ever met. There were so many times when she'd managed to keep him alive using nothing more than her sheer force of will.
"Goddamnit, Steve, you don't need to be talking like that," Dad muttered into Papa's chest. "You're gonna scare the kid."
"I think that's a great idea," said Peter, placing three cartons of each in their shopping cart. "Is that what you're gonna want for dessert then?"
, if you're not a sight for sore eyes," Tony said as Steve's large hands slipped around his waist, drawing him right into one of his patented bear hugs. Tony immediately breathed in, allowing the glorious scent of his husband's aftershave mixed with just that slight touch of vanilla wash over him, feeling the stress seep from his body in waves.
"Well… yeah, that is part of it," Ned admitted. "You know my mom just likes to know what's going on, so…" He gave his head a quick shake. "Anyway, she told me that one of her friends was walking in the city on Saturday afternoon and saw Dr Stephen Strange go into a comic book store."
"Thanks." Tony quickly gathered his papers, hurrying out of the hangar before Phillips could change his mind. He had no earthly clue as to why the old officer was suddenly so insistent on Tony getting out on time to visit his son, especially since he couldn't recall a single instance where Phillips had ever even met Peter.
I sigh and let him lay me down on the bed, but I refuse to let go of his arm so he slips down on the side of it, sitting. He runs a hand down my air soothingly. “I'll be right here,” he assures me.
They get interrupted as the door opens.  Director Fury steps into the room, looking a bit tired and annoyed.  He looks at me with his good eye and I have enough sense to look guilty for letting Deadpool get Director Fury.  “I hear you're opting for an early check-out.”  I shrug, helplessly.  “They put me in the same room, on the same bed as the first time I almost got torn to little spider bits.”  Fury raises his eyebrow at the 'little spider bits' part but doesn't comment.  “Come on, pleaseeeee~?  I'll be a good spider and rest at home.”  Yeah, I know.  I'm a bit pathetic, begging and all that.  I may or may not be using puppy eyes.
Bucky was silent but he must've been thinking along the same lines. “Yeah, kid. We'll find out how they got passed SHIELD and whether or not they had inside help,” he growled at the thought. Personally, I hadn't thought about a traitor, but after everything it was more than possible and it unnerved me.
As they're running as fast as they can go with me in their safe arms, I can hear the eerie pound of footsteps in the background. I know where they're coming from. Who they're coming for. I press my face into Cap's chest and breathe in the familiar smells of home.
It feels a lot better when Steve slips another, thicker, blanket over my body, being careful of the wires and tubes. Finally, I feel warm.
That specific indentation I had made during my last stint in this medical prison.  Let's just say that I had not come out of the whole Venom incident intact and ended up in this very bed to be plagued by nightmares.  Nights, which in this case, had messed with my senses and... okay, so I didn't remember much about how the heck it happened, I just know that my head did not enjoy the metallic alloy SHIELD's Helicarrier consisted of.  (Drywall is so much more soft~  Like getting thrown into pillows~ ..Meh, for an enhanced human, such as myself, at least.)
“Now then. Let's continue where we left off,” the doctor stated. “I believe I was trying to rip that alien away from your DNA.”
So... I was so grateful for the recent comments that I received on this fanfic.  It's been quite a bit since I updated and I didn't feel much motivation, but the comments really got me to rethink my approach and I was able to write another chapter.
Somehow Steve found some more fruit and kept an eye on my as I nibbled it. We settled in to watch whatever was on TV. I wasn't feeling up to the news though. I didn't want to see all the people I could've been helping.
“The symbiote's cells seem to be trying to forcibly merge with your mutated DNA and attempting to recode it. Kind of like a second mutation,” Bruce stated.
"Tony, don't!" Steve said, grunting as the agent cuffed his hands behind him. "Please, sweetheart, don't. Don't give them anything that they could use against you."
It’s why he’s even here in the first place.  Because he refused to quit.  Even when everyone from Ma to Phillips to his old college teammates were telling him that he should.  That he needed to put his health first.
"Yeah, well, it's not the wizard's husband who's down there fighting on his own now, is it. It's mine! And I'm gonna go help him!" Tony pushed himself up to his feet, bringing Peter with him. "C'mon, Pete. Let's see what we can do with this ship to get it going."
"I know you didn't," Steve said softly. "But I meant what I said. I'm scared, Tony. I'm scared that if this happens again, we won't be able to get Peter back. I know how strong he is, but no one's unbreakable."
"I know, honey." Tony brought Steve's hand to his lips, kissing his knuckles. "Helen and I were talking a bit while you were making Pete's food earlier, and we're thinking that when Obie and Killian were trying to convert him down in Miami that his mind set up some kind of self-defence system against the programming, which is why he goes into a coma whenever he hears the trigger words."
"Six new aircraft just engaged from Meridia, Rogers," said Major Kowalski amidst another burst of gunfire. "We're still picking off most of 'em, but be advised that two of 'em are heading directly for you and Carol."
"Yeah, Buck, I remember," Steve said softly. Like many elderly people in Brooklyn during the late nineteen twenties, Bucky's grandmother had come down with tuberculosis, and not even the expert nursing care of Steve's ma was able to save her.
“Ho-ly shit,” Tony whispered, tapping his fingertips on the dark polished wood of his desk.  “Am I really gonna do this?”
There was no response, and the intellectual part of him hadn't been expecting one. But Steve still felt a sharp stab of pain when he pulled back and saw Peter just lying there, completely unresponsive. It was almost as if he were—
"Is that it?" demanded Steve as he loomed over the man, his eyebrows knitting together into a frown. "Were you ordered to target our son?"
—filled Tony with a dread almost more paralysing than the news itself.  Tony could survive with a broken heart if he had to, but he would rather die than subject his precious son to that same pain.
Pain pierced Tony's heart as he looked down at his half-finished plate. While his mother may have worked hard to earn a living, the intense stress she'd been under because of it had caused her to withdraw from pretty much everyone, including Tony, leaving him to fend for himself from the time he was younger than Peter. If Mr Jarvis hadn't been there to keep him in line for as long as he did, Tony was certain that he would've been dead several times over.
have to tell you that I'm not at all in the mood to remove that privilege from any of you today. Now, do I make myself perfectly clear?"
“Is he still in his room, J?” Tony asked as he ran his fingers through his hair, grimacing at its greasy feel.
It had been eight years, ten months, and thirteen days since the last time Tony had felt anything more than a fleeting attraction for someone, but really, who was counting?
"Yeah, I'm sure Liz's mentioned you once or twice," Mr Toomes said. He shifted his arm carrying the files, causing the top file to open slightly. "Well, if you don't mind, I've got some stuff to do upstairs, so…"
He and Sam got to their feet, with Sam clapping him carefully on the shoulder. "I'm not gonna tell you that everything's just gonna be okay, 'cause I can tell you for sure that it's not. This is something that's been with you for a long time, and it might take just as long to work through all of it. But as long as you're willing to make the effort, then we can eventually get it to a point where it's not completely dictating your life. All right?"
"Oh gods, what now?" Tony groaned as Steve retrieved the datapad, his nose scrunching in confusion as he read the message.
It felt like only a few seconds had gone by when Tony suddenly jerked awake, certain that he'd felt Peter's elbow dig into his side. Peeling his eyes open, he was startled to find that it was already dark outside, with the stars glowing in the distance through the wide windows.
"Uh huh," said Peter. "But I'm fine, and I really think we should be more worried about how we're gonna get the stupid glove off of the monster guy." He glanced over at Dr Strange, who seemed to be regaining his composure. "Do you have any idea when Thanos is gonna show up?"
Peter smiled as he shifted on the bed, his stomach already growling from the delicious smell of his breakfast. It had been so long since he'd eaten a meal that was actually hot that he'd almost forgotten what food was supposed to taste like. Ms Sharon had tried to deliver his meals in the hospital as soon as they came up from the kitchen, but after sitting on the kitchen carts for who knew how long and the fact that Ms Sharon was always assigned to too many patients than really was feasible, his food was always lukewarm on a good day, with it most of the time just being downright cold.
With a quick nod in Sharon's direction, Steve hurried from the room and out of the hospital, barely pausing to take a breath until he was on his motorcycle and racing back towards the barracks. It was so unlike him to lose himself in a conversation like that—and with a kid, no less, one that he'd never even met before—and it was throwing him for a far bigger loop than he cared to let on.
I wasn't too sure about how this chapter went.  I hope it reached your expectations.  I've been caught with my other ongoing fanfiction.
“Who's up for movies and drinks?” Tony piped up. “Not you, though kid,” he shot me a look. “You can have soda or a milkshake.”
I let the gloves fall to the ground as I opened my mouth, licking my lips and trying to swallow my panic. “Well...” I spoke aloud, “that's not normal.”
There are so many conversations about Spider-Man and his enemies that I just don't want to talk about. I managed to keep quiet and ignore Clint the first few 20 times he asked. And then I blew up. My outburst had silenced any questions from everyone. I admit that I feel so guilty for that, but even I have to have my secrets. Some things are too just fresh on my mind to open up about. Tony wanted me to talk. I quickly shut that down when I reminded him that he has a whole ton of his own secrets and traumas. Low blow, but it got them to stop asking all together.
Sure, there were going to be questions. I'm sure the Avengers still weren't completely caught up with the symbiotes. Everyone would want to know about them and then they'd want to know how to kill them. That last part would be debatable, but after this last time, knowing how to fight them
A warm hand slips onto my shoulder and squeezes it gently. My eyes flick towards Wade. I won't be alone, that much is obvious. “Here goes nothing,” I say, putting on my Spidey bravado as I slip the comm into my ear and turn it on.
Finally they break.  “Okay,” Tony huffs and folds under pressure.  What can I say?  I'm awesome.  “But you are restricted to bed rest for a week.”  Shit.  Out of one prison and into another.  I must've been making a disgruntled face because Clint pipes up.  “It's not that bad.  You get to leave SHIELD.”  My head bobs a bit back and forth and I nod, reluctantly.  I hate to admit that he's right.  “And Bruce is in charge of you.”  I sigh, surrendering.  “Fine.”  A flick of my eyes at Bruce and I smile a little.  “Looks like we're buddies, buddy.”  Bruce only raises an eyebrow, remaining silent.
Over 10,000 hits?  Whoa!?  How'd that happen?  Haha, I'm amazed.  Really.  You all are great.  It's no secret that I've been skeptical about this work from the beginning, but to see that people like it this much is incredible (and kind of a mystery to me), but it's the first fanfic I've done in these fandoms (as well as the first fanfic I posted on AO3) and I'd like to thank you all for reading.  And a special thanks to those who comment - I would not be as motivated to continue without all of the great comments.
"Okay, I think we can dispense with the history lesson," Tony said sharply. "Just tell us what you found."
"Peter, what're you still doing awake? It's really late!" Ms Sharon said, startling him as she stepped into the room, her stethoscope at the ready. She had offered to take over checking on him during the night so Grandma could try and get some sleep.
"Oh, yeah. There's a great doctor who works here who keeps a close eye on him, and he still sees the surgeon who fixed his heart once a year. But you know what they say. I mean, even cops tend to have higher incidences of heart attacks and stuff just because of their jobs, right?"
Slowly flexing his bloody, tingling fingers, Steve began searching through the various closets and shelves for another punching bag. It had been a long time, months, since he'd run out, as before—well,
Tony thought, instantly earning an extra squeeze from Steve. Their boy had already been through enough shit to last three full lifetimes. He definitely deserved a pass on this one.
Finally, once he was almost finished with his float, Peter cleared his throat. He'd thought he had heard Dad head down the hall towards his lab during the night last night, and had even been tempted for a bit to join him. But he'd ended up falling asleep again before making up his mind, and by the time his alarm went off for school, Dad was back asleep.
exclaimed Howard, his jaw dropping in shock. He heard Maria gasp behind him, reaching for his arm just as the officer grabbed onto them, drawing his hands behind him. "But how can you possibly believe that I had anything to do with—?"
“I would be happy to, Master Peter,” replied JARVIS.  “Please allow me a couple of hours to compile the information.”
Barely three seconds later, Tony jumped back with a yelp as a fully-grown man suddenly appeared next to Clint and Pietro, dressed in some kind of comic book-looking armour and wearing a helmet that resembled those worn by early twentieth century deep-sea divers.
More tears stung Tony's eyes, ones that he quickly blinked away as he attempted a smile. His contented feeling would evaporate as soon as Steve walked out their bedroom door, but he could at least pretend for the moment, for Steve's sake.
There was a pause as everyone took a collective breath, with Gwen finally breaking the silence by clearing her throat.
"Now you're just trying to change the subject," Steve whispered as he leaned close enough to kiss the tip of Tony's nose. "Please, tell me what's on your mind?"
the best, honey. Barnes and Danvers, they're both damn good pilots too, as are the rest of your teammates, but you definitely stand out from the rest."
“Mr Obadiah Stane, I am Agent Fury of the FBI,” Fury said, flashing his ID badge with a flourish.  “And you, sir, are under arrest for violating the Economic Espionage Act, for conspiring to arm insurgents against a duly-elected government, for conspiracy to commit treason, and, based on these last few minutes that we just witnessed from down the hall, assault on a highly-decorated Officer of the Army.”  He reached behind him for his handcuffs, taking hold of Obie’s wrists.  “You have the right to remain silent.  Anything you say can and will be used against you in a court of law—”
"Language," Steve said automatically, chuckling when everyone except the three Guardians groaned and rolled their eyes. "All right, all right. Is it dinner time yet?"
"What?" Tony yelped as a bolt of pain shot up his left arm. "Now wait just a goddamn minute here! Why all of a sudden is this considered more of an Avengers-level event than the actual attack from space?"
Tony huffed, grabbing the frisbee from Steve's hand and launching it back in Clint's general direction before turning to Steve, looking up at him through his impossibly long eyelashes.
"Oh, really?" Gwen said with a laugh—and she had such a pretty, melodic laugh, Peter had noticed that on their second day of school. "You seem to have two of a lot of things. Two fathers, two Uncle Jameses, two backpacks—"
"Oh, I always love chicken noodle soup when I'm sick!" Peter said as he retrieved the broth, thankfully with no issue. "And I bet yours'll taste even better than the restaurant stuff I've always had."
"What the hell is that stuff?" asked Clint as even more of the shiny water started to pool and then drain off the man's exposed skin, almost like sweat. "It's almost like he's—"
Steve nodded, moaning softly when Tony dug his fingertips into his scalp. Like Peter, Steve absolutely loved getting his head rubbed.
"It is possible," said T'Challa. "I would have to go there myself to verify it, but based on what I have experienced in the past, I would be surprised if it were not the case."
"Yeah, and given that all you super-types were just as affected as the rest of them, I'd say that means this thing must be pretty powerful," said Sam.
"I know that, honey, but the rest of it… sometimes I wonder if the very fact that our team is also our family makes it even worse for you when things go wrong." Tony paused, swallowing hard. "Like when Bucky fell from the train? It hit you so hard because he was your best friend, someone you thought that you loved, where if it would've been Morita or Dugan or any of the other men under your command you still would've mourned him, but not quite in the same way."
Tony huffs out a sharp breath, throwing up his hands.  “Christ, Pete, what’re you wanting me to say?  Yes, I looked at the guy’s face.”
he thought as Thor landed a few metres away, grunting as he swung his giant axe at the seemingly endless incoming targets. After a particularly violent swing he noticed Steve, greeting him with a polite nod.
Once the food was ready, Steve piled it all onto a tray with two bottles of water and headed for the lab. He found Tony in his usual spot near his main workstation, standing in front of a holographic model of what looked like a larger version of the little round robot vacuum cleaners that Peter had had in his Malibu house bedroom. Tony whipped around as Steve approached, his wide, frantic eyes narrowing into a frown as he noticed the tray in Steve's hands.
Tony's eyes narrowed in surprise. "You're joking, right? You actually think I'm gonna leave the two of you alone after what happened?"
"Yeah, yeah, just don't tell anyone, okay?" Colonel Phillips said with a wink. "Can't have anything threatening my reputation."
Glancing down, Steve saw that Tony was right.  Peter was curled up into his side, so soundly asleep that his mouth was hanging open.
If Dad and Steve's date went well enough, then maybe they'd even end up getting married someday. Uncle James had told Peter a while ago that he was planning to propose to Auntie Carol soon, once he was able to work up the courage, and Peter knew that the Air Corps strongly encouraged their pilots—especially their test pilots—to marry and have families since it gave them some semblance of stability in their pretty unstable lives.
JARVIS ran the simulation again, the grainy image reappearing. Against his instincts Tony forced himself to keep from blinking, trying to gather as much information as he could before his scratchy and exhausted eyes gave up the ghost.
Tony wished he could've been a fly on the wall during the tongue-lashing Howard got from Aunt Peggy once he got home, though. He's pretty sure it would've helped him feel a bit better.
looks. "C'mon, Dad. I know I'm not an official Avenger, but I'm not eleven years old anymore either."
"I see," he said. "Well, I'm sure that my officers will be very pleased to hear that a such highly-decorated Captain as yourself has such a firm grasp on the protocols that we hold so dear." He paused, tapping his fingertips together. "Very well, Captain. You are dismissed."
His good mood completely gone, Tony dropped down into his car and slammed the door, revving the engine just a bit too much as he peeled out of the garage and onto the street.  His “talk” with Obie had cost him almost ten minutes, meaning that the possibility of finding Peter with bites taken out of his own arms had just increased exponentially.  The kid had been so hungry lately it was like watching a human tornado every time they sat down to eat, which could only mean that another growth spurt was brewing.
"Please, sweetheart?" pleaded Steve, shifting so he could reach for Tony's hand. "You have that look on your face again, and—"
He paused for a moment to catch his breath, brushing the damp hair out of his eyes and frowning at the blood-tinged wrap stretched across his knuckles. He knew Tony was going to tell him that he'd overdone it again, with that worried look on his face that Steve always dreaded, but at the moment he didn't care. He needed to be both mentally and physically ready to face the Armed Services Committee in the morning, and smashing the hell out of a few punching bags was one of the best ways for him to do that.
"Um, I'm sorry, Mr Stark, but he's refusing to leave the building," interrupted Stacy. "He says he won't leave until he knows for sure that his family is safe."
"Hello, Mr Lang," Steve said as he opened the door, allowing Scott to step inside. The man looked like he'd just driven across the entire country, which, based on what Steve remembered of him, was probably exactly what he had just done.
“But Regina did still pass information back and forth,” Peter said gently.  “And they still made the bullets.  And according to this, those bullets have been used in Sokovia.  And one of ‘em hurt Steve’s friend, and—”
"Pardon me, Captain, sir," JARVIS cut in. "But Sergeant Barnes wishes to report that all is currently well at the theatre. Master Peter and Miss Stacy are holding hands and she is leaning against his arm, but they are otherwise enjoying the movie."
It would’ve been so much easier for Steve to continue to justify his hatred for the man if Tony had been anything like he’d been expecting.  If he had shown up dressed in one of the five-figure, perfectly tailored suits and fancy pairs of sunglasses that he’d worn in all of the Stark Industries promotional photos and videos that Steve had seen way too many times.  If he’d had that aloof look plastered on his face that so many wealthy people wore when they encountered people who weren’t, like they weren’t even worthy to be breathing the same air as Steve was.
It wasn't his fault that his family attracted supervillains like magnets, or that the only one of them not allergic to winter had been Obadiah.
"Oh, like you never do any of that! I'm just a beat cop, but you guys… you're the real deal!" the young officer said, clearing his throat as he glanced over at Stacy. "Anyway, it was so awesome to meet you both!"
Instantly, Steve's eyes darkened again, his half-hard cock twitching where it rested against Tony's hip.
The light flashed again, another direct hit. Over and over, every single command that popped into Tony's mind, the suit obeyed. From forming whatever defensive and offensive weapon he could think of to constructing protective shields and barriers in a fraction of a second, in over ten minutes of continuous testing, the suit didn't make one single mistake.
"No, I'm lucky you love me," Steve answered. He wove his fingers through Tony's soft hair, his jaw tightening as he tried to keep his tears contained. He had no business waking Tony, not after how hard he had fought to get him to sleep in the first place. After an almost three-day stint where he had barely come out of his lab, not even swapping out Tony's coffee for decaf had been enough to get him to stop, finally forcing Steve to have to resort to begging him to take a break. Steve absolutely
Besides, if there really were other people out there like him, then he owed it to them to try and help.
"Let's make sure that he remembers this one, yes?" the voice continued as two sets footsteps echoed against the concrete floor. "I think it might make our task a bit easier from here on out."
Exiting Peter's room, Steve headed next for the kitchen. If he couldn't help Tony with whatever he was doing in the lab, then at least he could make sure he had some decent fuel besides coffee. Tony drank enough coffee for three people on a normal day, and it got even worse when he was pulling his all-nighters. And as much as Tony liked to dismiss all of the issues that he'd had with his heart and his health in general, Steve still believed that he couldn't be too careful.
"Yeah, JARVIS, that's fine," Steve said. He groaned slightly as he sat back up, rubbing at his eyes as he heard the penthouse elevator activate and make its way down. Both Bucky and Sam lived only five floors down from the penthouse, their apartments directly across the hall from each other. Bruce's apartment was directly below Sam's, and featured a built-in Hulk-sized panic room in the very back that he and Tony had designed, very similar to the room where Bucky was kept during his first few months at the Tower following Project Insight, while Clint's and Natasha's apartments were located two floors down from Bucky's.
"All emergency crews to the runway!" Phillips barked into the hangar PA system. "Alert the hospital that we've got an injured pilot coming in, condition as of yet unknown!" Then he whipped around, pointing at Rhodey. "Get on the comm to the backup patrol pilots, I want them in the air ASAP! Tell them that they have permission to fire at anything that even dares to show its face, you got that?"
Finished with Tony's shoulders and upper back, Steve continued down to his middle and lower back, eventually reaching his ass. He took his time there, massaging it with such deep but tender strokes that soon Tony felt the pleasure building deep inside his gut, pleasure that spiked as Steve's index finger accidentally-on-purpose slipped down into his crack.
I am planning a new superfamily story that I hope to begin posting around the beginning of March, so I won’t be gone for too long 😉.
"Yeah, well, good luck trying to throw off Mr Photographic Memory over there," said Bucky. "It's not fair for the rest of us mere mortals that all he has to do is read the damn books once and he's got 'em down pat."
"So?" Peter snapped back. "I can't climb trees anymore! I can't help my dad build stuff in his garage, or even go outside, but that doesn't mean that my dads don't still love me!"
"Yes," said Dr Cho. She stepped over to Steve, placing a gentle hand on his shoulder. "This is how Peter heals himself, Captain. And unfortunately, none of us have any control over it. We just have to give him the time that he needs."
Steve smiles.  He was happy to have Bucky as a teammate at the Trials, and he’s even more grateful for him now.
"Can you please start compiling files on these individuals? Military histories, work histories, things like that? I wanna know how and why these names wound up in a HYDRA bunker. And if you can find their current whereabouts, that would be very useful too."
“I need—I need to move,” he managed to sputter, forcing the words past his frozen throat as he tried to convince himself to stand back up, to keep going towards his destination.  Even if the bunker wasn’t heated, surely the structure itself would be warmer due to the simple fact that he would be indoors, out of the wind.
"Yeah." Steve had heard that story before as well, although not exactly the reason why. "I'd still appreciate yours though," he said softly. "And I know Tony would too."
And the fact that neither he nor Steve would be able to visit Peter for at least the next couple of days was already causing Tony's anxiety level to ratchet up even more. As long as nothing went wrong, Steve and Carol's mission was scheduled to last a little less than three days since they would only be deploying one satellite each per orbital rotation. And while Tony knew that he might be able to sneak away from the base for a bit as long as everything was stable, there still was a very good chance that it wouldn't be.
“Well, I guess that’s what happens when you're the owner of the largest tech company in the entire world,” Steve said.  “And even more so when that same tech company is making groundbreaking strides almost every single week.”
Steve's jaw twitched and his brow furrowed, relaxing slightly when Tony patted his knee. "Director Fury explained that the Strategic Science Reserve had become the organisation known as SHIELD, and since I was a member of the SSR when I went down, that meant that I was an employee of SHIELD after I was found."
Peter sighed, nodding. "Yeah, I know. But he was pretty excited about the space-capable aircraft, wasn't he?"
"That's all right, little guy," Steve said, relieved. "Just come to bed now, okay? You have to be exhausted."
"That is the theory, sir," JARVIS said. "However, without a copy of the structure for reference, I cannot be certain."
An indeterminable amount of time passed. With no windows in his cell Steve had no idea if it was day or night, only adding to his overall disconcertedness. He made an attempt to use his heart rate and respiratory rate as a way of keeping time, but quickly realised that his mind was so muddled from pain, hunger, and dehydration that he couldn't seem to count to anything higher than twenty without dozing off into a sort of semi-sleep, snapping awake again every time the pain crescendoed.
Steve kissed Peter again, then slowly unwound Peter's fingers from his hand, flexing it a couple times once it was free and wincing at the pain shooting across his knuckles. Nothing felt broken, but given Peter's immense super-strength Steve suspected that it had been close. He got to his feet, hurrying around to the other side of the bed to find Tony still staring at Stane, completely still and unblinking, almost as though he had gone catatonic.
"Babe?" Tony said again as he crouched down in front of his husband, gently tugging on his left hand. "C'mon, it's not gonna do any good to just sit here and brood all night."
And since Papa was about to relive some of the worst memories of his entire life, both Peter and Dad wanted him to be comfortable.
Steve thinks for a moment.  “Okay, I can see that.  You're referring to the way Loki was able to use it to open the portal between Earth and space?”
And while the new device had helped some, as had Steve and Tony trying to keep him so busy that he'd have no choice but to sleep, Steve was still rather concerned about how well he was going to do with being away from home for two whole nights.
"Yeah, they're all having a ball," said Phillips, not without a hint of nostalgia. "Almost makes me wonder if you designed those things to be a bit too much fun."
The truth of the matter is, Obadiah viewed Peter as a threat, and used Tony’s mother’s death as an excuse to get Howard to oust both Tony and Peter.  As Tony’s son, confirmed by not only one, but
"Yes, well… we'll have to catch up some more once this is all over, hmm?" said Uncle Thor. "Perhaps over a game of chess?"
"Right," Bruce said as he leaned over Tony's shoulder, pushing his glasses up the bridge of his nose. "But doesn't all that mess with—?"
To any other swimmer, Schmidt would be intimidating.  But to Steve, he's just another opponent.  One that by pure luck of the draw he has yet to face head-to-head.
from the parking lot caused them all to whip around, finding Liz's mother waving from her Mercedes sedan.
As it was, Steve could now hardly look at Tony's arms, which were covered in bruises and bandages from the failed IV placement attempts, without breaking into tears. He at least wasn't completely paralysed, like he had been down in Miami for all those weeks, so he could occasionally respond to Steve's voice and squeeze his hand. But that didn't make it much easier for Steve to have to see him like this.
"JARVIS!" Steve shrieked as he tore off his cowl, fumbling in his belt pocket for his phone. His hands were shaking so badly he could barely hold onto the small device, and his chest was so tight it felt like it was about to split open. "JARVIS, where's Peter?"
And he was right. In fact, during the two-plus hours of car ride, Peter was certain that his cheeks managed to achieve a level of pinkness never before attained in his lifetime.
Peter pressed his palms to his cheeks, trying to cool himself down. He couldn't remember being this flushed since before his enhancements started. "Yeah, and now I'm sorry that I said anything."
normal parameters, the UI had said. Not just anyone's normal parameters, but specific to Peter himself due to the gene mutation that began expressing itself shortly after he turned twelve. With dangerous body temperature drops always a concern due to the spider DNA embedded inside his own, Peter's bedroom was kept at a balmy twenty-seven Celsius, and even that higher temp required him to sleep in pyjamas that would've had Tony roasting in about three minutes flat. He and Steve's bedroom was kept at a cool twenty-three Celsius, the perfect temperature to allow them to cuddle together while they slept without the risk of either of them overheating.
Peter grinned, covering Gwen's small hand with his own. "Well, I'm pretty sure no evil wizard's ever tried to kill me. In fact, I've never even met a wizard. At least, not that I know of."
"A guest?" Steve said as he glanced back at Natasha, who simply shrugged. "JARVIS, show us who it is, please."
"Eh, it's just comfy," Peter said with a nonchalant shrug, as if it was a perfectly normal occurrence for a teenage boy to be doing his homework while sticking to the wall nearly five metres up from the floor. "It's not like I'm gonna fall."
But Steve didn't enjoy thinking about his recovery, so he always just changed the subject, something he knew hadn't escaped Tony's notice. He didn't like remembering the weeks that he spent in captivity with a busted-up foot that still ached whenever it rained, being drugged into believing that he was fighting against his own husband.
"T-Tony! Where's—?" Steve choked out as he grabbed onto Tony's arms, the sheer terror in his voice and eyes hitting Tony like a blast to the chest. He was shivering violently, and Tony drew him close, hoping the reactor powering his suit would help warm him a bit. "T-Tony, w-where is he? Where's P-Peter?"
"And yet, these suits now remain in the possession of Stark Industries, rather than the Department of Damage Control," said Davis.
Tony squeezed his eyes closed, trying like hell to hold onto his patience. Phillips was one of the good guys, it wouldn't do anyone any good to deliberately piss him off.
"Shh, buddy, don't try to talk, okay?" Tony soothed, brushing Peter's hair from his forehead. "We're gonna get you taken care of as soon as we can, don't you worry."
With a muttered curse, Uncle James tossed his phone aside and leaned back on the couch, scrubbing at his eyes with his palm. He gave a start as he noticed Peter, his expression instantly morphing from frustration to sympathy.
"Since whoever was behind this attack did in fact manage to kill the Wakandan king, I'd say that's a very reasonable theory, Mr Wilson," Fury said. "And as I told Tony, I've offered the assistance of the Avengers to Prince T'Challa, but I'm honestly not holding my breath on that one. If this humanitarian visit was Wakanda's way of trying to dip their toes into interacting with the rest of the world, I can't imagine that their prince is going to be too eager to make another attempt."
"Yes, I'm sure you're right," said Ma. She gave Tony's arm a reassuring pat. "Chester was just here a bit ago to tell us that they're almost ready for him down there, so… we'll let you have a bit of time beforehand, all right?"
"Oh, he will," Steve stated, his fingers tightening around Tony's hand. "It'll just take some time."
Glancing up at the wall clock, Steve frowns when he sees that it’s only half past nine, his frown deepening when his thirty-minute warning for his department heads meeting pops up on his monitor.
"Yeah, I guess, but you're sure you don't have something better to do?" Tony asked. "It's not gonna be too exciting watching me read reports."
Nodding at Dr Strange, Steve watched in awed trepidation as the doctor held out his arms, spinning his right in a circular motion as another of the glowing golden circles appeared. Steve quickly stepped forward, holding out his hand towards his obviously shocked husband, who was standing in the middle of their kitchen.
"Yeah, I know," Steve said. "But hasn't the baseball season already started? I thought you and Bucky have already been to a few games."
“Uh huh,” Peter said with a sigh.  “Just… make sure he knows I’m not mad at him or anything.  Please?”
Scrabbling for Tony's hand under the table, Steve gave it a quick squeeze before clearing his throat.
"Oh, this? Yeah, I did," answered Tony. "I like to tinker with cars, or at least, I did; don't really have the free time to do all that much of it anymore, and this lets me alter the air pressure in the increments that I like. Some of the older cars need to be babied a bit more than the newer ones, so…"
Colonel Phillips shot Howard a scathing frown. "As I was saying, whoever the scientist was in charge over there thought that instead of choosing some sickly guy on the verge of death to be their super-soldier, that he'd be extra smart and choose someone who was already proven to be strong. Well… what the scientist didn't take into account was the fact that the guy they ended up choosing was already half-mad, and—"
"Okay, but why?" Uncle Bucky asked. "Just to trap Steve up there? That seems like a helluva lot of work just to trap one pilot up in space, even if they knew it was gonna be Steve."
Peter nodded as he opened the truck door, setting one foot down on the pavement and jumping back just as fast when a fancy sports car suddenly screeched to a halt in the parking spot right next to them. Peter frowned as Flash Thompson climbed out of the car, tossing him a wink as he slammed the door closed and sauntered towards the school.
"Peter's gonna be okay, Tones," James said as he drew Tony into a tight hug. "He is one tough kid, and you know it."
I hate to admit it but the way I've been entranced with my other fanfics about Kid Flash, this one will be updated infrequently (in other words, I have no idea when).
Sabertooth snorted, amused. And that answered that question. Logan was going to be pissed he missed out on kicking Sabertooth's ass in SHIELD. I raised an eyebrow. “Oh, I so have to be there when Fury learns he had a break in. Not that I'm approving of it or anything, but right out from under his nose. That's going to hurt someone's pride,” I rambled, promptly snapping my mouth shut when Doc Ock gave me the evil eye. Grouchy.
“You need to get back,” I told them, desperately, off-handedly telling them that they were right and things could go sideways any minute now.
Venom – an alien symbiote that really has the munchies for humans and, unfortunately for me, seems that I'm the only viable host. The first time I encountered Venom, I'd been naive and too stupid to realize the implications. When we'd become one I was stronger, faster, more energized. I could save more people as the Black Spider-Man than I could on the average day.
Tony shook his head as he gulped down the rest of the coffee in his cup, the hot liquid burning a fiery path down his throat and causing his eyes to water.
Grandma attempted a smile, which came out looking like more of a grimace as she stepped into the room, her eyes flicking over to the datapad.
And, not surprisingly, Dad had thrown a fit once he found out, rushing to do a complete background check on the man who's name turned out to be Spencer Smythe, a war vet who had been medically discharged, likely for mental health reasons.
"Peter!" Steve cried. "Little guy, you have to listen to me! These people are going to hurt you, you have to find Dad and get away from here!"
said Davis. He pushed his glasses up the bridge of his nose, peering at the sheet of paper in front of him.
"Aw, hell yeah!" Mitchell shouted as the entire crowd erupted into cheers. "That's what I'm talking 'bout!"
—seemed more bony, causing his ring to wobble a bit as Steve carefully pressed it to his cheek before lowering their joined hands back to the bed.
“Cool,” said Tony, thanking his lucky stars that he’d had the foresight to link JARVIS’s programming into the security cameras inside the warehouse.  “Tell ya what.  How long do we hold onto those video archives in the warehouse?”
Tony's fists were tightly clenched as he paced back and forth in his lab, the not-so-calm discussion he'd just had with Fury still echoing inside his mind. Fury had assured Tony months ago that every single member of the former STRIKE team had been accounted for, and that Rumlow was likely fish food at the bottom of the Potomac following the crash of the three Project Insight helicarriers.
“So, tell me, Doc,” I interrupt Vanquil, “where's my green benefactor that put me here? I assume the general is in cahoots with that nut-job.”
Even the normally cool assassins were staring at me with looks of shock.  The beeping of the heart monitor had become increasingly faster from the moment Deadpool had mentioned 'Spidey', which was odd because I'd felt like my heart had stopped at that moment.  I felt a distinct lack of oxygen in the room, like that one time I had been drowned in Venom before he'd attached to me.  I was going to die of oxygen starvation.  Not from Green Goblin or Doc Ock, not even from any of the other villains I'd met during my time as Spider-Man.  No, I was going to die from shock because Deadpool opened his mouth one too many times.  “Peter?  Peter, calm down!”  Matt's voice reached my ears with panicked worry.  Odd because Matt doesn't do worry that much, at least not visibly.  Steve was by my side, telling me needed to breathe.  Even the others looked panicked.  Breathe?  Wasn't I?  That was what the heart monitor was telling me I was breathing and… oh.  I was hyperventilating.  Fuck.  That's why I felt like the room was getting a little too close to becoming a roller coaster.
and Steve, though I knew he could've. It just went to show me how much Tony was stressing. “You want to watch a children's movie when we could watch something action packed and awesome like
I grumbled as I took a nice, hot shower. Jarvis woke us at noon, citing some kind of health stuff that made Tony swear and threaten to change Jarvis' voice to make him sing every response. Steve had rolled his eyes and just asked what Tony wanted for lunch.
'I hope Dad and Bruce figure something out soon…' I thought, fading. Not quite asleep yet, I startled slightly. I called him “Dad”. 'Huh..'
Brows furrowed, I frowned in confusion. “Wait – what? DD is scared of going out?” I asked in disbelief.
Bucky's silent and still as he looks at me. He's always been a kind of silent guardian. Ever since I came into Tony and Steve's care, he's paid me as much attention as real family. He helped me pull a prank on Clint once. We put glitter in the exploding arrows he uses for training. It was awesome. Pink and gold everywhere.
My chuckles die as my own stomach grumbles and I make a frustrated sound as hunger pains resonate through my middle half. “Damn, now I'm hungry.”
I plopped down on a stool at the counter, putting my mask in my lap. “I'm going to patrol after we eat.”
Been a while since I updated.  Admittedly, this one and "Crow" are so difficult to update.  I lack so many ideas, but hopefully this recent chapter is enough to get me going again.
Ehhh… They had Thor catch me. Let me tell you, Thor's muscles are freaking awesome for battles. But you do
Seeing the hybrid safely locked away with Fury and Coulson taking charge, I felt safer. Not as safe as I could be, but for what the capture of the hybrid couldn't secure, the arms around me belonging to Daredevil and Deadpool did.
“You're okay, Peter. We're not going to leave you,” Steve assures me. I hope they won't. I really do. Tony ruffles my hair for a moment before he moves over to talk to Bruce. I wonder when they arrived, but I leave it be. My mind must be playing tricks on me.
I wasn't panicking quite yet. Just a little bit. “And that is?” I wanted to know what this 'extra' was that they had added. Hopefully it was just rocket boosters or something.
Steve's hand slid from mine and his arms curled around me, hugging me against him. It seemed like he was speechless. Clint, Natasha, and Director Fury were silent in all of this and it was a bit unnerving, yet not unexpected.
I turned my head so I could smile at him. He did always seem to know what to say. Maybe we'd both been alone, living our lives under the guise of normalcy before we'd joined this group. Maybe we'd both been at very low, lonely points of our lives when they'd found us, but for whatever reason he always seemed to know just what to say.
“I didn't know if I was going to make it..” He reached out and tugged me against his chest, letting my forehead rest against his chin, my face turned into his neck. “Sshh,” he shushed me gently. “It'll be okay. I gotcha, kid. It'll be okay…”
I wanted to believe Tony. I really did, but they didn't know him as well as I did. Normon.. He was always persistent and determined. If there was something out there that he wanted, I had little hope that he'd stop.
“Yeah, Carnage and I have met and we did the whole “bonding” thing. Needless to say I was unsatisfied with its level of redundancy and we parted with me throwing it into a vat of molten metal.” I pulled a smile onto my face and directed it to the vial, letting it become smug. “It was simply too easy to beat.” I was rewarded with a flash of frustration in the Doc's eyes before it was covered up with determination.
Hello~  Sorry this chapter is a little bit shorter than the others and a bit late on the update perhaps?
My head gave a nasty throb and I groaned, burying my face in my hands. “Are you okay?” I didn't necessarily feel like answering, but I knew they were worried. I could practically feel the way Steve tensed and just how on the edge of it Deadpool was. “My..head.. it aches,” I admitted, looking up a little.
“What do we do?” Natasha's voice cut through the tense atmosphere. Tony looked at me, lips tight with concern.
Bruce and Tony, who had been talking in hushed tones, froze. I could feel them looking at me. “Peter,” Steve started a bit concerned. I shook my head, “What happened?”
Matt shrugged at me when I turned my attention to him as Deadpool manhandled me. “Make sure he eats his fruit too,” Steve called, waving them on. I groaned, muttering, “I'm not five years old.. I swear.”
Peter gave a nod, attempting a smile.  “Don't worry, Dad.  You know Papa won’t give up without a fight.  He’s even more stubborn than you.”
"I appreciate it," O'Brien said as he grabbed a crystal highball glass, pouring himself a generous shot of the whisky. He took a sip, swirling the amber liquid around in his mouth before swallowing, his eyes glued to Steve the entire time.
"I'm just not sure how well she's gonna take it. I mean, he's a Stark for one thing, and you know how she feels about Howard Stark. And she's always wanted grandchildren, so…"
that I'm leaving you to fight this alone! Thor can take Peter, but I'm staying right here and that is it!"
"I do," Steve had said as he placed his hand on Peter's shoulder. "And I love you as well. You're like the son I never thought I'd get to have, and I am so lucky that I got to meet you."
"Well, isn't that what this newfangled thing we're starting tomorrow is supposed to address?" asked Sam. "The next phase or some shit like that?"
Steve looked over at Tony, who responded with a quick shake of his head. Turning Lang over to the authorities would accomplish a whole bunch of nothing, and besides, it was Hank Pym he was really after. Not this stuttering, bumbling, Captain America fanboy.
, that as my brother and I got older, we would choose the 'proper' person to marry. Well, my brother did. His wife was the daughter of one of my father's colleagues, and his wedding was considered to be one of the most highly sought-after invitations that year. My father ended up inviting over three hundred guests, and all of it was paid for by the Air Corps."
"I'm surprised your dads actually let you come here tonight, Prince Peter," Flash said before taking a big sip of his drink. "Don't they usually keep you locked in your room when you're not in school?"
"Get this to Maria Hill ASAP, we need to put out an arrest warrant on Adrian Toomes before he can get the hell outta dodge. And something tells me he's gonna need protective custody, 'cause I don't think his bosses are gonna be too happy with him once we get our hands on him."
It was as though the boy was literally wasting away. Most of the time in the hospital Peter had been shielded by his mass of blankets, but now, out in the open, it was painfully obvious to Steve just how thin he'd become.
"C'mon, sweetie, let's get you home, hmm?" Stacy said as he helped Gwen into her coat. "Your mother's pretty worried."
"'Cause I'm not the one that held a fucking blaster to your son's head, you got that?" Tony snapped. "So, if you would all please just circle up here, we can get started!"
"Not calling you out when you saved him at the movie theatre," Dad continued. "Trying to butter Steve and I up, asking if we need anything and then offering to pick you up from school? It all fits, Pete!"
"Oh," Ned said. "Well, I can understand that. Well, maybe he should ask Thor to join the police force?"
"Ah," Thor said as he sucked loudly on the tiny circular mint. "I do believe that I enjoy this particular Midgardian treat. I'll have to secure some more before my return to New Asgard."
he states, grateful when his voice doesn’t quiver.  “Now if you don’t mind, I’d appreciate it if you could get out of my face.”
Or Steve. He was a lot of fun to have around too, and he didn't constantly look at Peter as if he was going to suddenly burst into flame either, which was nice. Peter was getting really tired of people acting like he was going to crumble into pieces if they happened to look at him wrong.
Pepper shot him a puzzled frown.  “Okay?  Um… I’ve done that several times before, so I’m not sure why—”
"That doesn't make much sense, Tony," Steve said. "For someone who loves power as much as General O'Brien, I can't imagine why he'd just relinquish it so easily unless he had something else up his sleeve."
"You mean, our help?" Peter said as he tipped his bowl up to his mouth, downing the last of the broth. "'Cause we make a pretty good team, don't we?"
"I'm—" Tony started, quickly clamping his jaw closed. There was no way his usual, off-the-cuff "I'm fine" was going to fly anywhere with Steve. He knew him far too well.
"A lot of civilians do," Steve cut in. "And in a time like this, being able to communicate with friends and family is very important to keeping the panic down to a dull roar."
At least not until their current crisis had passed, which, despite all of his numerous attempts, Steve was still no closer to figuring out when something might happen than he had been before the team's trip to Wakanda.
"I wouldn't be at all surprised if you're right about that," said Steve. "He sure knew his way around that aircraft."
"I would like the record to show that Captain Rogers and Colonel Rhodes were successful in their mission to rescue myself and my son," Tony spoke up. "And that they not only rescued us from an active war zone, but that Captain Rogers also saved my son's life without question or hesitation, even before I knew who he was."
"No, which is one of the main reasons why he's being moved," said Gwen. "The FBI thinks he's still too paranoid about his bosses getting to him or to his family if he talks, so they're hoping by moving him to this different place it'll make him feel more secure. That's also why we don't know where Liz and her mom went, they're like in witness protection or something now. It's really just a huge mess."
He may as well take some of the wealth that Dad so voraciously protected and try and do something good with it.
“You're damn right it’s gonna,” said Bucky.  “Good thing Sam said to leave my arm back in the apartment, or I might’ve been tempted to beat the hell outta this guy with it.”
Failed to keep Tony from succumbing to his own guilt and despair until he was nothing more than a broken shell of the man that Steve had married.
“Ahh…”  Tony trails off as he starts muttering again, a gibberish of letters and numbers that sounds like a made-up language from one of Peter’s movies.
"I dunno, but from back here it seemed like it was heading directly for ya," said Major Lorne. "And I'd say that it was about three times bigger than any other missile we've come across."
"Well, I'd mourn if I lost my AirPods, so I guess I can understand that," said Ned. "So then if Nidavellir is a real place, do you think Atlantis is real too?"
"Peter, maybe we should quit talking about this stuff," Uncle Bucky said worriedly. "All it's doing is making you worse!"
"Mr Stark," Bartlett said, pulling his badge from his breast pocket as Tony's belly gave a hard swoop. "Captain Rogers. Good evening."
"Captain Rogers?" JARVIS suddenly asked, his subdued voice still nearly launching Steve off the bed. "Are you in need of assistance?"
"Oh, so you're both a genius and a gentleman?" Gwen asked as they started walking towards the exit, with Peter clinging to his backpack strap as if he thought it might suddenly hop away. "Which one of your dads taught you that?"
"Yeah, Uncle Sam always knows who owes who what," said Peter. "We should start calling him the human ledger or something."
“They end up being life-changing,” Tony finished.  He brought Steve’s hand to his lips, kissing his knuckles.  “Pretty sure I’ve experienced something like that myself a time or three.  But hey, that’s that whole saying about hindsight, right?”
"Oh, no! No, of course you don't have to explain it!" Lang exclaimed. "I mean, I don't even know who your father was, Mr Stark, let alone—but you're—well… you're Iron Man! My daughter even has one of your action figures! And personally, I don't think your suit is cute at all. I think it's totally badass."
"Well, it is. And that's not your fault. It's just… how it is. But yeah, there were plenty of times when I'd look over at Pete while I was working, sitting there in his little cordoned-off play area in my office, and wonder what the hell I was doing to him. You know, one of the first words that he ever said was 'rocket'? His very first one was 'Dada', which, you know, made me pretty damn proud, but 'rocket' wasn't too long after that. And, I don't know, it just didn't sit right with me. But at the time, the company was all that I knew, and I was hell-bent on making sure that if by some chance something happened to me, Pete would be taken care of. And that meant I had to make sure that Obie stayed in his lane."
A huge thank-you to my wonderful betas, allthesinnersandallthesaints, JehBeeEh, and She’sLikeTexas ♥️
"Ah, just the two gentlemen I was hoping to find," Fury said, with that dumb, shit-eating grin on his face that Tony had despised for years. "Do you guys have a minute?"
"No, probably not, but I'd really appreciate it if you could do it anyway," Peter said quickly. "Override Hufflepuff6."
"Goddamnit," he grumbled as he shook the scorching hot droplets from his fingers. He grabbed an oil-stained towel from a shelf, mopping up the rest of the spill before it could destroy the rest of Bruce's papers, even though they were already littered with so many coffee stains that he probably wouldn't've even noticed more of them.
“I see,” Steve said with a smile.  “But from the tone of your voice, I’m guessing that you think your strategy is the better one?”
"Oh, ha ha bloody ha," Bucky retorted, in such a perfect impersonation of John Cleese that Steve did a double-take. "I swear, if you say another stinking word about brave Sir Bucky, I'm gonna—"
Steve made a choked-off noise in the back of his throat, tight with the tears he was trying—and failing—to contain. "No, Tony, you know that's not true.
"Eh, I'm doing okay," Peter said as he rubbed at his nose. "I finished my drawing of Mrs Bird and her chicks yesterday, do you wanna see it?"
"But I'm not, honey," Tony said. He lifted his head, gazing at the man that he loved more than he ever thought he was capable. "And neither is Pete, and so… you've just got to know what you're getting into here."
"Yeah, they weren't bad. Not quite up to Times Square's standards, but I'll take this over the stupid touristy crowds anytime."
To which Tony had agreed, now that Peter had been named an official member of the Avengers. He and Steve had debated long and hard about making Peter's presence on the team official, eventually deciding that after his heroic performances in the initial skirmish in New York, on Titan, and in the Battle of Wakanda, they really could no longer deny him.
Three strides later, his lungs already burning from exertion, Steve reached the bank of a small, shallow river. He felt another arrow whiz by his left side as he leaped across it, swinging his right arm at a jumping war dog's head before he even had a chance to land.
"Yes, those will definitely be nice to have back as well," agreed General Arnold. "I guess the one upside to the Pentagon's ancient communications system is that we haven't had to rely on the cell towers, but—"
"I'm pretty sure that's what the Captain just said, Senator," said Tony. "Would you like him to repeat his statement?"
"All right," Steve said as he gently removed his fingers. As soon as they were free, Tony twisted around, settling himself with his back to Steve's chest. He knew that Steve usually preferred to face him while they made love, but Tony was already so dangerously close to breaking down that he was afraid he might lose it completely before Steve left, and he didn't want Steve worrying about him while he was flying into a potential war zone.
"Okay, so…" Steve's voice trailed off as he read over the text, detailing the early life of Mark Raxton. According to the file, Raxton had also been a scientist at SHIELD, working on yet another top-secret project likely under the tutelage of the same head scientist as Morris Bench, who they still had yet to identify. Steve skimmed over the more technical aspects, his belly giving a hard swoop as he came across another name that sounded familiar.
I try to focus on it, keep my mind from the reality of where I am, what I've been through and what's to come, but it's difficult. I feel… weak, helpless.
I didn't notice when we landed on the pad at Avengers Tower. I barely even noticed when we stepped out of the transport. I was too focused on the loud gasps and shouts of my name as Matt and Wade helped me down the ramp.
“How did you end up with SHIELD?”  Everyone turned to look at Natasha, who had been so quiet since the realization.  “I – “ My voice closed up and it felt like my heart was ready to blow up in my chest.  “-eter?  Peter?”  Oh, hyperventilating again.  Damn.  Matt and Wade would burst in here any minute if I didn't calm down.  I closed my eyes and forced myself to calm down.  It left me weak.  I felt too weak to regale them with that particular tale.  But they had to know.  Some of them were agents of SHIELD.  They had the right to know how we could be on the same team.  Fighting the same fights and yet not know it had been me.
Wade grins and saunters over there, picking it up and returning to the cot with the soup. “You really don't, but at least it's somewhat filling,” he tells me, holding the bowl out.
My eyes grew heavy as the adrenaline faded from my body and pure exhaustion took over. “Get some rest, Peter,” Matt murmured softly. I shivered as a sliver of fear rose from the thoughts of seeing that thing in my sleep. “It's okay, we're right here. We won't leave you.”
I'm sure I looked like a limp doll in between their costumed bodies, but for once I could honestly care less. They helped me onto a transport with Coulson and a few agents staying behind. 'Must be staying to scope things out,' I remarked to myself.
I tell them about my parents and how they were SHIELD scientist's working at Oscorp, trying to create a Super Solider Serum with Spider DNA.  At that, Tony looks like he wants to interrupt, but a sharp look for Steve shuts his mouth again.  I go on about how they died before trying to kill the program and how one of the spiders bit me when I was trying to find out more about them at Oscorp.  My tale goes from getting my abilities to using them to earn money, to losing Uncle Ben, fighting the Lizard and variety of other villains.  Finally it comes to losing Gwen and Aunt May, my friend becoming my enemy.  SHIELD had walked into my life after the Lizard incident, but I really stuck with them after getting injured fighting the good fight after Gwen and Aunt May.
The dark red slime monster.. the hybrid. It was contained, but it still felt so near, so close. I could still feel the hold on my body like it had its claws still hooked in me.
Sorry, it's been so long since I've updated this.  My muse has been tugging me this way and that, and I'm also making preparations to move...  And enough of my excuses.
Another nudge and I took the controller from Clint. “Prepare to get your Italian license revoked, kid.” I rolled my eyes and quipped back, “Well, prepare to be sent the nursing home, old man, because you're about to get beat.”
And then in an instant, everything fell silent. The screams stopped. The pain vanished. The blood lust trickled off...
“I'm okay, Wade...” I try to assure him. He hums, not believing me. “I just need to get some rest and maybe dream about those tacos from Santa's.”
“Now, you just sit right here Petey-pie,” Deadpool said, dumping on the couch of the Commons, “and lil ol' me'll go fix us up some grub.”
“Sure, kid,” Bucky said, reaching out and picking me up like I was a child. Normally I would've scowled and mumbled protests, but it felt good to be in his strong arms. A former assassin he might've been, but he was a hero before that and a hero now. My own personal thoughts? Bucky's badass.
“If I recall, you spent a good amount of time making nice with a friend of this,” he gestures towards the vial. “Uhh...” I don't get it. He knows that and he just continues right along. “It made you a better spider. Stronger. More powerful. And more… Deadly.”
a mutant. There's a big difference. Mutate – yes. Mutant – nuh-uh. Not that there's anything wrong with mutants. It'd just be nice if someone got it right for once.
I could hear the eye roll over the phone, I swear I've been trying to do that since day one but only
Daredevil's shoulders tensed, but I could see him thinking it over. Natasha was quietly relaying the idea to Tony and Bruce, who were no doubt getting ready as they were. Steve gritted his teeth, looking very unhappy with the idea that Goblin could be working with someone else.
I look back at Tony and Steve, running my eyes over the faces of the other Avengers.  “So… can we go home now?”  They look a bit nervous?  Odd.  They said being Spider-Man wasn't an issue (in not so many words).  So what's the issue?  “Pleaseeee” I stretch out my begging, widening my eyes and adding a few tears to the mix.  I can hear Matt muttering under his breath about what a manipulating web-head I am, but I ignore him.
My wrists twinge as I bury my face against him, hugging him closely. I want to forget. I want to be somewhere else. I want to pretend that all the possibilities of testing that I've seen in experiments aren't going to happen to me.
“We try everything I've done to get the symbiotes off of me,” I failed to tack on that this time it was more of a kind of.. internal situation. I shuddered, reaching up to Daredevil's hand on my shoulder and squeezing it.
Steve set me down lightly so he could get suited up. “No,” I shook my head. “Maybe he forgot something? Or maybe..” I was hesitant to suggest such an idea. “Maybe, he's a distraction.”
“Spidey!? Spidey, calm down!” It was a familiar voice, but fuck if I could place it. I snarled when metal wrapped around my body, pinning me back.
And then I heard Clint asking what the hell Deadpool was doing there.  The Avengers looked noticably like they wanted to rip Wade's head off for touching me.  Yeek… And they were also looking at me with a lot more confusion and determination, searching for an answer.  Oh yeah.  Changed my answer.  Praise masks.  Someone get me mine.  Fuck maskless faces.  I felt naked in front of them, which was dumb because they didn't know me with a mask.  They'd met Spider-Man, but not Peter as Spider-Man.  You know?  They didn't connect the two.  Matt must've sensed my discomfort.  How could he not?  His hand gently grasped mine and I squeezed his hand as he tried to reassure me without speaking.  This was a good time to tell them.  I could tell that Natasha and Bucky were starting to pick up on the hints Daredevil, Agent Coulson, and Deadpool had dropped.
Clint really looked like a kicked puppy.  God, I hate that face.  “Oh fuck it.”  I started pulling out the wires and the IV.  “Peter!  What are you doing!?”  I ignored Steve and Bruce's protests.  Seriously.  I just wanted to tell them 'I'm a big boy.  I have accelerated healing.  I can get out of bed whenever I damn please.'  I had to reign that in as I kicked off the sheet and walked, albeit slowly and wobbly to Clint.  “Damn bird brain, I'm okay.”  I wrapped my arms around him, delicately and hugged.  It wasn't long before I felt Clint return the hug, a little too tightly, but it really looked like he needed it.
Luckily I still have phone privileges, although I think they are being monitored by Jarvis. But that's not the point. It was early and I hadn't been expecting any calls, which was why the phone near about made me jump onto the ceiling. I groan, digging through the sheets of the bed, searching for my phone. I just wanted to sleep and yet someone was calling this early. Damn them.
I know that. It doesn't make me less afraid though. Ever since I woke up on the building overlooking the city, I've been afraid of closing my eyes, of waking up someplace else, alone, and forgetting how I got there.
I follow his eyes and examine the black bowl of white creamy soup. There's something brown in there and it doesn't look like it's going to taste good at all. 'What's that green thing…' I shake my head clear of those thoughts. “I don't want to know.”
Eyes closed, I dream. I dream of my family, of the times I spent patrolling… I could almost feel the wind slide over my suit, the weightlessness of my body mid-leap. I could almost hear the sounds of my family's voices, their laughter.
