“Well, we didn’t,” Dean says, rolling his eyes. “Do you know if we can get him out of it?”
“Neither did I,” Dean admits with a frown. He still feels like he’s behind the curve on that one with Jack, at least. He can feel Cas studying him, so he puts on a smile that he knows doesn’t reach his eyes and says, “We should try to put him to sleep.”
“Sure you are,” Dean agrees, even if both of them know that’s bullshit. “Do you want to talk about it?”
from happy, and kissing you isn’t going to change that.”
, he tries saying, but there’s no sound. He tries shouting, but it gets lost in a vacuum of nonexistence. It’s hell; it’s
Jack is truly an adorable toddler, which shouldn’t surprise Dean because Jack, normal Jack, is an adorable teenager, or pseudo teenager, or whatever the hell he is. It’s funny how Jack doesn’t actually look like either of his parents much. Actually the more Dean stares at the bright blue eyes and the quietly reflective way Jack looks at his surroundings, it hits him that while he might not be Cas’s actual son, the resemblance is uncanny. It’s not even that Jack looks like Jimmy Novak’s vessel, but there’s something so intrinsically Cas about him that Dean feels a wave of warmth.
When they pass through the blankets section, there’s some debate on whether the baby blue blanket with cows on it or the pale green one with ducks on it is more Jack’s style, but they decide it’s neither when Jack grabs a baby pink blanket with elephants on it. There’s also a debate on what toys Jack needs; Dean insists that he should get a bunch of hot wheel cars with the little ramps to slide them down, while Cas thinks Jack should get something more mentally stimulating. Once again, Jack wins the debate.
Cas startles awake with a gasp and blinks up at Dean. “Hi.”
Dean bows his head in shame. There’s not much he could say to that, so he says what he knows is true. "I'm really sorry, Cas."
Dean feels a chill run through his veins and he can feel Amara scan through his entire being. When he doesn’t say anything, she asks, “Why do you want to destroy it?”
“Five more minutes,” Cas says, his voice hoarse with sleep, and Dean tries to ignore how
Cas’s voice brings Dean out of his thoughts. Dean opens his eyes and sees Cas shuffling from one foot to another, a look of concentration on his head. His voice trembles slightly when he says, “Is the spell literal? As in, does it have to be the grace of Jack’s actual father?” Cas hesitates before he looks at Dean. Something flickers behind his eyes and Dean knows that Cas has an idea. Cas turns to Rowena and says, “Could the spell be a metaphor and we can substitute it for something else?”
Feeding Jack ends up being a lot easier than they thought it would be. It’s probably more due to the promised ice cream than anything else, but Jack eats his dinner quietly, with Cas feeding him. Dean tries to school down the
“Or Caddyshack,” Claire pipes from the floor. “I already gave you my review, and you still made me watch it again.”
"He's here," Cas whispers, eyeing the church with some apprehension. "I'm surprised Chuck hasn't found him with the amount of energy he's radiating."
“Sometimes I still think that I’m going to wake up one day and find myself in the middle of another apocalypse,” Dean admits. He averts his gaze away from Cas, but Cas tilts his head so that Dean is forced to look directly at him. “I’ve spent so long fighting one stupid war after another that I don’t know what’s real and what’s not.” He hesitates, looking away from Cas. “I think I’m broken, Cas.”
“Haven’t seen this in a while,” Dean says as he stands in between Cas’s legs; he slips his hand inside Cas’s jacket and sneaks it under the flannel which is certainly his. Cas noses at his jaw and Dean leans in to kiss him softly.
There isn’t a word to describe the chill that runs down Dean’s body — he almost physically rears back in shock and fear but catches himself before he does. Cas immediately pushes himself off the table and stands in front of Jack. Dean reaches a hand out to pull Cas back.
Dean sighs. “Okay, fine.”
“Which already makes you better than our own fathers,” Cas says. “They knew they should have been better, but chose not to. At least, you’re trying.”
“Good luck,” Dean says, clapping him on the back. “You’ll be great. She’s insane if she agrees, obviously, but you’ll be great.”
"The old sheriff in town was a djinn," Cas explains as he shrugs his trench coat off. He folds it neatly and drops it into the trunk of the Impala; the action triggers another memory of another trench coat that Dean hauled from car to car during another period in time where Cas wasn't there. Dean closes his eyes to calm the memory of the black goo, still utterly vivid in his mind. If Cas notices anything, he doesn't react. "I don't know who the new sheriff is, but I'm sure they would be willing to help."
“Can I ask you something?” Dean says later that night.
Nobody says anything for a long time until Billie stands over him.  “Now, you live your life, grow old and alone, and you’ll die — and when you die, I’ll come to collect you.” Her voice is icy cold and Dean feels a sense of vindication when the fear flickers all over Chuck’s face.
Cas averts his gaze away, clearly uneasy at the whole situation, but Dean doesn’t really care. He’ll do whatever it takes. When he looks at Billie, her face is soft. She shakes her head. “I’m sorry, I don’t. The Empty is different. It is vast, terrifying, and exists out of normal governance. I don’t even think God has power over it.”
With that, Cas steps to the side and takes the cart out of Dean’s hands, pushing it towards the pasta. Dean instantly thinks about Sam telling him to not complicate it, and this is pretty ridiculous, all things considered. It’s Cas; they’ve been through so much that there’s probably no gesture in the world that could do that justice, and all that matters is that they’re together. Dean catches sight of David Jenkins, the owner of Lebanon Food Mart, reading a newspaper. There’s nobody else in the shop.
He freezes at the sound of the bunker door opening and shutting behind him. He looks up to see Cas and Jack standing on the balcony. Jack raises a hand in greeting before he marches down the stairs, quickly turning down the hallway towards his room, not saying a word to the room. There’s something about Jack’s expression that feels dark and worrisome, but Dean literally can’t bring himself to look away from Cas.
Dean knows that there’s no point arguing against it now so he just nods, resting a hand on Cas’s shoulder. “If there was any other option, you know I would —”
Dean puts away Cas’s trench coat in the hall closet and puts away the fishing poles and bait. He walks into the kitchen to find Jack sitting at the kitchen table, frowning at his coffee mug. When he hears Dean walk into the room, his eyes shoot up. “Is Cas okay?”
any of this, and it scares me.”
Dean takes in Cas’s form and the softness of his face as he pushes himself further into the pillow. It’s a funny sight, Dean thinks - an actual angel of the lord sleeping like there’s no tomorrow. Dean realizes that if Cas was human - truly, fully, human - he would hate the mornings. Dean thinks about how things would be if the scene in front of him is actually how his life is. It surprises him a little at how much he aches for that.
, that.
Billie narrows her eyes and says, “What are you talking about?”
Cas puts the spellbook back on the shelf - this time it’s much, much higher, and drops down to the floor. He ruffles Jack’s hair. Dean twists so that he’s sitting cross legged on the floor across from Cas, with Jack in his lap. Cas aimlessly reaches over to the talking teddy bear and hands it over to Jack who finally seems content enough to just sit around and play with it.
Jack grins at him, and Dean just hopes he can keep that promise.
Dean looks down at the sleeping boy in the bed, so utterly small that he’s dwarfed by the pillows and feels the shame run through his veins. He feels his throat constrict at the wordless emotions. Cas walks up to them and gently places an arm on Dean’s shoulder, tilting his head towards the door.
Cas is stirring the soup on the stove with all the concentration in the world, like making dinner is the same as leading armies in heavenly battles. Dean bites the inside of his mouth to keep from smiling too hard. He walks over, careful not to wake Jack up and asks, “Need help?”
,” Cas argues, cutting her off, his eyes flaring dangerously. “You’re the only one who can reap God.” Cas pauses to look at Billie. The anger in his face dissipates and it’s replaced by a look of pure desperation. “You know that there’s another way. It might be harder, it might be more dangerous, but it exists, and we’re begging you to consider it.”
Dean huffs out a low laugh. He softens when he looks at Jack who is all fiery determination. He says, “I know you want to help and you think that this is the only way, but running to your death isn’t exactly the best idea out there.”
He keeps repeating the words to himself as a reminder; his fingers twitch and he reaches out to grab some dirt, only for Cas to smack his hand away.
They get like this sometimes; infinitely comfortable in a way that Dean hasn’t been with anyone in a long time, or ever, if he’s being really honest about it. Months being apart, actively angry at each other, doesn’t change that. With his hand still on Cas’s waist, Dean takes a chance; he traces his hand along Cas’s hip bone, slides it under the hem of Cas’s t-shirt.
His statement hangs in the air and he knows Sam feels it too. He doesn’t say anything though because there isn’t much to say. Instead, Sam reaches over to the side table and pours two glasses of whiskey. He quietly hands Dean his glass and they drink in silence.
He’s about to fall asleep properly when he hears Cas’s soft, “Hey, Dean?”
“Dean,” Sam starts, but hesitates. “Is this about —”
“I think I’d like to try it,” Jack tells them. He’s quiet for a moment, but then laughs. “I think I found some movies on what to do in high school, and they have my favorite actor, Zac Efron.”
“Maybe angels would have been happier if they were human,” Dean says.
“Cas, you know me,” Dean tries again. He doesn’t move towards Cas, and instead keeps his distance, like he’s approaching a wounded animal. “I know you’re scared, and I know this fucking black goo has been pretending to be me, but man, you gotta believe me.”
Cas doesn’t actually want a reply, though, because he pushes himself off the stool and walks out the kitchen without waiting for Dean to say something. Dean feels like an empty shell as he follows Cas out to the living room where Cas has a duffle bag packed. He watches Cas pick up his angel blade; he eyes it with a focused intensity that Dean has only ever seen in battle. Cas doesn’t look at Dean, doesn’t say a word — hell, he doesn’t move. The air between them is so brittle that it could snap at any moment, and if it doesn’t, Dean feels like he would.
So, Dean does. With his voice barely keeping it together and his hands trembling, Dean tells Sam about it all; he tells him about The Empty deal, about Cas, about the fact that he feels like his whole world is about to explode under him and how it’s all Chuck’s fault, but they can’t kill Chuck because that means Jack dies, and he’s back at square one. He chokes out his feelings, one by one, because he’s been piling them up for years and now, it’s like the floodgates open and everything rushes out at once. He doesn’t know when Sam moves to the bed, but he does, and Dean feels strong arms pulling him into a hug.
“Sam, this is the only way,” Jack argues, voice rising an octave. “Billie read Chuck’s death book, and she knows that this is the only way.”
"I'm driving to Sioux Falls," Cas says, after a lengthy pause. Dean knows he probably looks comical with how quickly his mouth drops and his brows shoot up. What the hell does Cas need to go to Sioux Falls for anyways? He doesn't need to wonder for long, though. Cas takes a sip of his coffee and eyes Dean carefully over the cup. "Claire called last night, and she might have a lead on Kaia’s killer, and she asked for help."
“I will do my damned best,” Rowena promises.
“No,” Dean says, pulling out the chemistry packet and handing it over to Jack. “Your chemistry homework is a science.”
“You should have told us,” Dean points out. “We could have done something about it.”
Cas narrows his eyes. “Clive McAllister?”
Dean does know, but he also wants to be prepared. “Yeah, but he needs clothes at least. He can’t just stay in my shirt forever. What if he spills something on it?”
“Yeah, but he’s my —” Dean freezes. He’s
“Dean, you can’t,” Sam says, exhaustion lacing his voice. “This is what I mean when you always get more and more reckless whenever Cas —”
Sam shrugs. “It wasn’t exactly a secret. I’m surprised it took you this long to figure it out.”
Jack blinks up at them. “Hello.”
Dean groans, but pushes himself up and rushes over to Jack. He manages to pull the book out of Jack’s hand before he could rip out the page. Jack immediately stares up at him with wide eyes and pouts, and Dean thinks that he’s doing it on purpose because Dean is
Dean lets out a low whistle, warming his hand on the fire. He says, “So, you’ve got it all figured out, then.”
The video itself is self-explanatory — Jack enters a doctor's office, speaks to the doctor in question before the camera glitches out. When the camera comes back on, Jack is sitting on a chair, eating a heart that clearly belonged to the doctor. Dean shudders, trying to keep himself from gagging. He's seen some whacked out, straight up insane things, but that's definitely up there on the disturbing scale. He stares at Cas for any kind of explanation that could make sense of it all.
goes entirely unsaid because Dean has never been good at swallowing his pride and admitting when he's wrong. Not even when Cas stares at him expectantly. Dean tries to say something to continue the conversation, but everything he could say at that moment feels inadequate at best and actively inappropriate at worst. When Dean doesn't say anything, Cas shakes his head, like he's confirming a silent theory he had, before he turns away to look out the window.
When she doesn’t say anything for a while, Cas squints at her. “Can you be more specific?”
It’s not until he hears footsteps walking into the room that he stops. Cas is leaning against the door frame, a frown on his face. Dean drops his head in shame. Cas doesn’t say anything, and instead walks over to the bed, and takes the bottle out of Dean’s hand.
"Dean —"
“Maybe now, you’ll stop spoiling the endings of movies,” Dean mutters, trying to rack his mind for tenth grade chemistry. When he looks up, Cas is glaring at him. He huffs out a breath and walks around the car. Dean groans. “Cas, come on. I love it when you spoil the endings of movies.”
Eileen makes a sympathetic noise. “You love him.”
“Chuck spent millennia doing nothing,” Dean says with a laugh. “I think you’ll be fine if you take some time off to be a kid. If there’s really some God thing that needs your attention, you can always pop out, take care of it, and come back.”
Dean feels the wetness on his face as he tucks up against Sam. He’s shaking and he can’t find the words anymore. He thinks he sobbed out something along the lines of
“Uh, fine,” Cas says, voice strained. He takes off his trench coat and suit jacket and drops them on the chair. He leans against the desk and crosses his arms across his chest. He meets Dean’s eyes when he says, “The usual. We killed the monster and saved the girl.”
“Goodnight, Cas,” Dean manages, after a moment.
Dean groans. “Jack, it’s too early.”
When he gets out, Cas already shrugged off his trench coat and his suit jacket, leaving him in his white button-down. Slowly, he takes that off too, with just the undershirt remaining. He doesn’t say anything before dropping down on the bed in the far corner and closes his eyes. Dean waits until Cas’s breathing steadies before turning to Jack, who is also watching Cas with concern.
There’s a vague buzzing sound, like a fly out of reach, and Dean’s heart lurches; hoping against hope, he thinks it’s Cas, but no matter which direction he looks at, he can’t see anything. There’s a flicker of movement in the distance, and the terror rises through him as he takes each nonexistent step. The movement disappears into nothing, the sound recedes into eerie silence, and Dean keeps walking. He tries keeping track of the time, but it could be minutes or hours or days, and Dean has no way of realizing it.
"You're going
“Yes, Cas, we do,” Dean says firmly. He’s sure Cas can manage just fine; he read hundreds of books on parenting, after all, but also Dean wants to help, and Jack is
, and there is a chance that they could bring him home. Cas studies him with cool, piercing eyes.
“Dean plays it more than me,” Jack points out.
She picks up her scythe again and is about to teleport out of the bunker when Dean says, “Wait.” Billie raises a brow at him. Dean clears his throat and exchanges a look with Cas before looking at Billie. “Do you know about Cas’s deal with The Empty?”
“You can use the bunker for your operation,” Cas suggests, changing the topic quickly.
Dean rubs the back of his neck and sits up. He really takes in Cas’s appearance. He’s here, he’s real, and Dean feels his heart tug. His emotions are racing away to the point where his mouth can’t catch up to them. Eventually he manages a quiet, “Hey. Are you —”
Cas hesitates, looking ahead. Dean waits because whatever this is about, Cas will get there eventually. Which he does because after a moment, he frowns and says, “Billie warned me that I would eventually start losing my angelic memories, and I know it’s starting already. There’s a lot of things I logically know happened, but I don’t
Dean blinks and thinks that every time he feels like he could never be more in love with Cas than he already is, he’s always proven wrong. He squats down next to Cas near the dirt patch; they started with carrots, but gradually the garden has everything they could need — Dean’s personal favorites are the pumpkins and the tomatoes. He sits quietly and watches Cas dig up the dirt, planting some seeds for herbs.
“Okay?” Cas echoes.
He kicks his bedroom door shut behind him, collapsing on the floor, with his back to the door. He’s tired. He’s so fucking
“Well, not yet,” Cas says from next to him. “We still need to close and we won’t get the keys for another month. There’s also the fact that it requires a lot of repairs before it’s suitable for us to live in and —”
Dean feels the heat off Cas’s body, feels the way Cas shifts to make himself comfortable. Dean stares up at the ceiling, counting backward from a hundred to one; he tries to make sense of his dreams, of Jack turning into a bomb on a soccer pitch — god, the normalcy of that; Cas’s voice ringing out in a black, empty void but Dean can’t find him no matter how hard he tries. His subconscious has a sick sense of humor. Dean lies awake, listening to Cas’s even breathing.
“Actually, on second thought, maybe you should take him with you. All he does is play that game,” Dean grumbles. Sam’s eyes light up with amusement and Dean shakes his head, “Man, I’m old now.”
Cas looks up at him and bites his bottom lip. Quietly, he says, “Something for you.”
Dean tears up the archives, pulling books and film tapes out, to find anything he can on The Empty. He carries them carefully to his bedroom, spreading them out. He takes out the bottle of whiskey that he keeps hidden under his bed, taking a swig directly from it, and dives in.
“Then, we have an agreement,” Amara says. Dean hesitates, twisting his fingers around. Amara eyes him curiously. “There’s something else, isn’t there?”
Cas squints at him. “I’m not quite sure that we’re that similar to a pair of reckless, Italian teenagers.”
Cas lifts his head to finally look at Dean. He studies Dean, his blue eyes unreadable. Eventually, he says, "I know."
Jack doesn’t say anything and, instead, bites his lower lip. He still doesn’t look at anyone. Dean exchanges another silent look with Cas whose eyes flicker with worry. Dean tries again. “Is someone else hurt?”
Dean feels himself drifting from focus as he looks through archaic versions of the Bible to figure out information about The Empty. He’s halfway through rereading the same page he’s been trying to read for an hour when Cas walks into the war room.
Dean finds Cas and Jack in the kitchen, a Connect Four board between them. Jack drops a yellow disc into the center column of the board. Cas huffs out a breath, staring at the board in complete concentration. Dean smirks, tip-toeing over to the table.
Dean is six months sober, which is six months longer than he ever thought he would be. The reception, hastily thrown together in their backyard, has a makeshift bar that Eileen is at, but when he walks up to it, she just hands him cranberry juice. From his corner, he watches Cas dance with Claire, and he catches Cas wincing as Claire steps on his foot. Donna and Jody are dancing with each other as well, and Donna waves at Dean when she catches him looking. Dean smiles, and waves back. There’s Jack doing a puppet show for Garth’s kids, and Rowena and Charlie in some form of argument. Dean feels so utterly warm at everything. He has a family. It’s a weird, completely dysfunctional, family, but it’s his.
“I have to do it for Jack,” Cas explains, voice filled with newfound determination. “I can’t say that I have much of my grace left, and it’s not regenerating fast enough, but if it’s enough then I will happily give it up.”
“You raised me from hell, you put me back together, and there’s nobody else in the universe that knows me the way you do. So, let me get you out of here,” Dean begs, his voice cracking. “Please — please open your eyes. Can you — Cas, can you look at me?”
Dean twists his fingers into his bed spread, pulling a loose thread. He says, “Cas would be so proud of you. He always said that you’d do great things, and I know I didn’t always believe him, but I just want you to know that I couldn’t be more proud of the person you’ve become.” Dean can feel the tears stinging his eyes. “I know you miss him. I miss him too, you know. If there’s even a chance that you could help bring him back, that would be great. I know you said you want to be hands off, and I respect that, I do, but if you could just bend the rules just this once. I’m trying; I really am, but I just don’t know what to do, kid.”
“The ghost isn’t
Cas turns around and glares at Dean. “Dean.”
; that he doesn’t need Cas. Except he knows it’s bullshit, and Sam probably knows it too. He could say that he needs Cas like he needs air; that he needs Cas like he needs something entirely separate from this world and the next, and none of that matters because Cas wants nothing to do with him right now. But, of course, Dean would rather die than say any of that out loud. Sam can fill in the blanks if he wants to. Hell, he probably already has.
“Yeah, we know,” Dean says with a sigh. “Jack.”
“Are you getting anything off him?” Dean asks in a hushed voice.
“Couldn’t sleep,” Dean admits. Jack takes one of the cookies and bites of a corner. For a fraction, his eyes light up, and Dean smiles to himself. “Good?”
When he opens the door, Cas is at his desk, staring down at a book. He doesn’t look up when Dean walks in; Dean twitches his fingers, looks around, not knowing what to do now that he’s actually here. He takes a step towards the bed and sits down. He waits for a moment and hopes that Cas takes pity on him and says something, but when he doesn’t, Dean clears his throat. “I talked to him.”
“You know, Jack, we can’t save everyone,” Dean says quietly. “We did what we could, and we stopped it from taking any more victims.”
Dean knits his brows together. “What about me?”
“I know I feel bad about killing her, and I know it’s my fault,” Jack explains slowly, his face scrunching up in concentration, like he’s picking every word carefully. Dean curls his fingers around a cookie. Jack lets out a sigh, dropping his face into his hands. “And I know I miss her a lot because she was kind, beautiful, and so strong. I know you don’t forgive me, and I feel bad about that.” There’s a slight tremble in Jack’s voice now.  “But, Dean, I don’t
Instead, he says, “We’ll figure it out. Promise.”
Almost like everything in their lives, nothing is ever as easy as it looks. The revenant wasn’t just unbelievably old — over a  hundred years — and immensely powerful, but it’s also way more violent than they expected. They got there too late to save two of the teachers, and by the time they got to the third one, he’s bleeding profusely. Dean sends Jack and Cas to take the teacher to the hospital, and works to resolve the ghost’s issue. It’s something about the school being a former school for misbehaving boys, and the entire thing hits frustratingly close to home. Still, he works it out because that’s what he does.
Dean shudders. He doesn’t like to think of those long weeks while Cas was dead.  It’s easily the lowest he’s ever been, but Cas doesn’t know that, and Dean isn’t about to open up about that. Instead, Dean says, “It’s probably for the best. Imagine doing all the shit we do with a newborn.”
“We’ll cross that bridge when we get there,” Dean tells him, placing a hand on Jack’s shoulder. Dean smiles encouragingly at Jack. “You didn’t give up on me when I had Michael trapped in my head, so give us a chance.”
Cas mumbles a quiet thanks when Dean hands it over. He’s too busy counting through the twenty dollar bill that Maria, the owner of the market, hands over. It’s not until they’re heading back to the truck to load their groceries that Dean can’t wait anymore. He blurts out, “I think I’m going to quit drinking. You know, cold turkey and all.”
Logically, Dean knows that it’s a throwaway line, and Cas doesn’t actually care about getting married; hell, they probably can’t get married in any legal capacity anyways, but it doesn’t stop Dean from thinking about it really fucking hard. He doesn’t even know where to start; he could propose and do the whole nine yards with a pawned ring and everything or he could just wait until Cas brings it up again. The problem is that Cas doesn’t bring it up again. He carries on with his life like nothing happened, and Dean is left googling
“For what?” Dean asks roughly, not quite looking at Cas.
Jack is silent for a long time, still staring at the ground. When he finally looks up, there’s the first hint of tears forming in his eyes. Dean takes a step forward to comfort him but hesitates when Jack wipes the tears away with the back of his hands. It takes a moment but he schools his face into steady determination. He takes a sharp breath and looks at them.
“Really?” Dean asks, mouth falling open in shock. “You’re coming back?”
“Woah, indeed,” Billie says, after a moment. She’s smiling down at her hands. “Well, this is certainly new.” She smirks at them. “I think I like this.”
“Can I -” Dean starts, unsure of his voice. Cas, bless him for knowing him better than he knows himself sometimes, nods slowly.
“Oh, you’re awake,” Jack says with some surprise. He leans against the kitchen island, where Dean places the cookie tray to cool.
Jack claps his hands together. “Now, you guys are compatible.”
“Alright, get in the car,” Dean says, handing all the papers over to Jack.
running through his head on a leash. Finding the grave turns out to be easy; he’s buried in the cemetery at the end of the road, with a clearly marked grave. They wait until sundown to start digging the grave, and Dean drops his lighter and sets the remains on fire. They circle back to the house to confirm that there’s no EMF, and when it’s all clear, they walk outside.
Dean smiles at them. “You kids have fun.”
Sam stares at him for a long time, and Dean can tell that he’s debating bringing up whatever he wants to bring up. Eventually, he says, “Are you sure you want to retire?”
Dean bows his head and closes his eyes. He lets out a quiet breath and asks, "Where is he?"
“Alive,” Cas mutters. “I have no idea how you dealt with being tossed around like a rag doll all these years.”
“He used to live here in the 1940s,” Patricia explains. “He was apparently a very mean old man. He killed his second wife in a drunken rage and then killed himself.”
Cas blinks, letting Dean tug him off the porch into the rain. “Dean, what —”
"Probably not," Cas admits.
“He’s a baby, Sam,” Dean says, rolling his eyes. “It’s not like we’re facing an apocalypse. We fed him, Cas gave him a bath, and now we’ll put him to sleep.”
He’s had good sex before; great sex, even, but it’s something totally different with Cas. Dean thinks, not for the first time, that no matter how many times he's touched Cas, no matter how many times they’ve kissed or fucked each other, it always feels like the first time all over again. He can map out every inch of Cas’s body like it’s his own, and yet, he’s always discovering new ways to fall in love. It’s so stupidly sappy, so unlike the version of himself that he thought he had to be, that it makes him more than a little dizzy.
Dean hates that he chose that moment to take a bite of his cookie because he chokes. “We — what?” Jack just furrows his brows in confusion. Dean swallows hard and clears his throat. He debates whether it’s worth explaining why they’re fighting to Jack. Dean sighs. “I said some things to Cas that I didn’t really mean, and neither of us is in a good enough place to talk it out yet.”
at some point, but right now, all that matters is that Cas is alive and home and Jack is — well.
He hugs Sam once and Jack starts reciting the incantation. The vial of Cas’s blood burns up, while Jack’s blood rises up to create a rift. Slowly, painfully slowly, the rift begins to open, revealing the black ooze that haunts Dean’s nightmares. He takes one last look at Sam and Jack, and steps into the rift.
Dean is bought out of his thoughts by Jack whimpering, his impossibly small mouth opening in a yawn. When Dean looks down at him, he lifts his tiny arms up. Cas laughs, and it’s this blissful, little thing that Dean can think about forever. Cas says, “I think he wants you to carry him.”
Later that night, when Sam and Eileen come over for dinner and movie night, Cas slumps against him. Halfway through Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy, Cas leans over and whispers, “The answer is forty-two.”
Amara laughs loudly at that. When Dean glares, her laughter turns into a small, amused smile. “You can’t destroy The Empty because it’s nothingness, but not the kind of nothingness I am. It exists as an absence of light and darkness; it’s cut off from reality, life, and God himself. So, no, it cannot be destroyed because what exists in the place of emptiness?”
Rowena stays silent for a long time, gingerly flipping through the book. She bites her lip in concentration, looking at the different diagrams that are laid out in front of her. Dean tries reading over her shoulder, but he can’t make out any of the words. Sam seems to, though, because he leans down and focuses intensely on the book.
“I don’t doubt that,” Cas agrees.
“Sorry, it’s the omniscience,” Jack waves, grinning. “It makes me — well, wordy.”
Dean grasps him gently around the waist and lifts him up easily, and Jack settles back into his arms, letting out a wet yawn against his shoulders. He stirs a bit, pulling a loose string from Dean’s shirt, but otherwise seems content with Dean lightly bouncing him as he paces the room. It takes about ten minutes, but Dean can feel Jack’s breathing steady; when he looks down, Jack is fast asleep, bringing his thumb unconsciously up to his mouth.
Lebanon Central High School has sixteen teachers and approximately hundred and fifty students. It also has exactly one exhausted principal. Cynthia Kearny takes one look at them, and Dean immediately knows that she’s some mix between overworked and underpaid, and she’s in no mood to argue with two middle aged men about student enrollment. She glances over Jack’s paperwork, and the three of them wait in silence.
Lately, he finds that he hates sleeping because he dreams, and his dreams are relentless in their cruelty. He dreams of his mother, gone too soon, and just when he got her back in the first place. Dean dreams about Jack and the gun in his hand, Chuck's cold smile, and Cas looking at him like he can't recognize him anymore. Dean dreams about Cas's hand in his, fingers trailing down his body, only for Cas to fix him a look and leave him empty and alone. He dreams of his own anger and rage, eating him up from the inside and pushing away everyone he's ever loved until he's all alone.
He doesn't know what he wants to say to that. He knows that he should argue it, say that it's not like
“He will,” Cas says easily. “He’ll probably criticize our decorating.”
The corners of Sam’s mouth curve down. “Dean, I’m really sorry.”
He can go a week if he really wants to, and he does really want to, but anything more than that is a struggle. Deep down, he knows that Sam is probably right and this is a problem.
“Please, Billie. Don’t make us lose him again,” Dean begs. He doesn’t have an ultimatum, he doesn’t even have the energy to fight her. He barely has the energy to fight Chuck and that’s out of sheer adrenaline and nearly four decades of increasing PTSD. When Billie doesn’t say anything, Dean sighs. “We’ll give you whatever you want, just — just, please. Please find us another way.”
“You saw him, Sam,” Dean argues, his voice becoming increasingly frenzied. “There’s no stopping him when he gets like that.”
Dean hears Cas exhale sharply next to him before he wordlessly crosses the room towards Jack. He kicks the body with his foot, and when it turns over, he hunches over to examine the body, tracing the hole where the heart is supposed to be with his finger. Dean takes several steps closer and picks up a discarded angel blade, which clearly belongs to whoever Jack killed. Cas pokes at the body once more before standing and wiping his hands on his trench coat. He hesitates a moment before he pulls Jack into a tight hug. Dean stands back as Jack drops his head to Cas's shoulder, and Cas pulls him in even closer. When they break apart, Dean notices that Cas's eyes are misty. He cups Jack’s face with one hand, his face trembling with unspoken emotions.
Cas is really handy, which is surprising because Cas is pretty terrible at anything involving actual house work. The number of times Dean walked into the kitchen to find terribly washed dishes and even more terribly categorized spices is enough to drive him insane. That’s also saying nothing of the clothes on the bathroom floor and the coffee mugs on the side table; but, when it comes to fixing a roof or replacing a toilet, there’s nobody better than Cas.
Cas doesn't lift his head from where he's leaning against the window. "I was thinking about taking him to a local diner and getting him a burger."
Cas tilts his head and narrows his eyes to study Dean. He doesn’t get a chance to push because Jack walks into the room wearing a backpack and looking every bit a high schooler. If Dean gets a little misty at the sight, well, nobody has to know.
Jack just eyes him with his brand of curiosity but doesn’t say anything, so Dean goes back to pacing the room. He walks over to Cas’s limp body and places two fingers on the side of his neck, but doesn’t find a pulse. He keeps his breath steady and walks from one end of the room to the other.
“Did you and Castiel get married?” Jack asks as soon as they’re out of earshot. He widens his eyes and looks at Dean with genuine hurt. “Was I not invited?”
Dean thinks. To Eileen, he says, “I’m fine.”
Cas blinks at him. “Dean?”
“Hello.”
Cas’s face twists into something so utterly devastating  that Dean freezes on the spot. Cas shuts his eyes and says, “I know you aren’t him, so please stop.”
Cas freezes, and everything suddenly goes still. Dean can see the regret crossing over Cas’s face, so painfully obvious that Dean wishes that he could take it back, but it’s too late. Cas’s eyes widen and he tilts his head away from Dean, and Dean feels like a complete idiot because of course Cas doesn’t feel the same way. As human as he is, Cas is still an Angel, capital A, of the fucking Lord, and Dean is as human as human can be. Cas has seen him do things that would have shamed the devil himself, so of course, Dean never had a chance. Dean opens his mouth to say something else — anything else, but closes it when there’s nothing else he can say.
“I have an option for you, Castiel,” Billie says, voice firm but still betrayed by a level of warmth. “You have a vial of your grace in your hands, and I can increase that enough for your seraphim powers to return.” Dean watches Cas twist the vial in his hand, eyeing it warily. When he doesn’t speak, Billie continues, “Or, I can give you another option.”
Dean waves a hand towards her and pretends to bow to her. “All yours.”
“Hey, guys,” Dean says loudly. Cas immediately flinches, dropping his red discs onto the table.
“You’re a miracle worker, kid,” Dean says, relief washing through him.
“Go ahead, Sam,” Cas says, firmly.
“Hey, Dean.”
Dean laughs. Sure, it’s a two day drive, but they’ve driven longer for things that are decidedly less fun. “Guess we’re going to Minnesota, then.”
“My grace is gone,” Cas tells him, the corners of his mouth curving down. He doesn’t look unhappy, but Dean feels guilty anyways. “Jack tried to put it back together, but it was practically impossible. I decided that it would be best if I gave it up.”
“We’re working on rehabilitation too,” Eileen says, signing along. “With the demons in hell, we’re just working with regular monsters and most of them can be saved.”
He hands it over to Jack and says, “I don’t know how much you need or if you can even get it off that, but it’s his blood. I didn’t wash it because —”
“I don’t know, Jack.” Dean says slowly.
Dean blinks in confusion. “
“What are you doing?” Sam asks again, confusion all over his face.
Dean takes that as an invitation to step into the room, closing the door behind him. He walks over to Cas’s bed, his bare feet pattering on the tile floor of the bunker. He doesn’t sit down though; instead, he picks up the vial, and delicately twists it. He can feel Cas studying him, so he puts the vial down and looks at Cas, who blinks up at him.
“And he agreed to it?” Cas confirms. Dean nods. Cas exhales and the tension leaves his face immediately. “Thank you, Dean.”
Jack sighs. “I understand, Cas.”
“Well, she’s been wrong before,” Sam shoots back.
“I got a job,” Cas says, looking incredibly proud of himself.
She hands them everything they need. As they walk back to the car, Dean feels dizzy staring down at the packets of sine and cosine curves, acid and base titrations, and the essay prompts on
“Wait, what,” Dean chokes out, dropping the butter knife in his hand. Cas narrows his eyes in confusion. “You — you think — you really are a fucking idiot.”
Dean thinks Cas is going to pull away, so he loosens his grip just slightly, but Cas just moves around him to pour the coffee into the mug, so Dean tightens his grip again. It takes a moment and then Cas is in front of him, handing him the mug; Dean slides his hand over Cas’s, taking the coffee mug from him, and placing it on the counter behind him. Cas looks up at him, blinking, and Dean thinks, not for the first time, that he could drown in the blue of Cas’s eyes forever.
Rowena bites her lip and shakes her head. “Well, no. I don’t think there’s anything that can kill God, but it could neutralize him and transfer his power to another being that can hold it. In this particular case, it would have to be Jack.” She shoots Jack an apprehensive look. “If he would be willing to do it.”
"Yeah, about that," Sam says slowly, eyebrows drawing together in worry. "You never told me why he left in the first place."
He can feel both Cas and Jack stare at him, but he focuses on the road ahead, taking the exit towards Lebanon. He clears his throat. “Yeah, I mean, why not? We could ask Sam to forge you paperwork and we could probably get you enrolled next semester, if that’s what you want.”
Dean nearly put The Rain Song on the mixtape. It was his mother’s favorite song, but it was a song that his father would always skip over whenever he would play the old Houses of the Holy cassette tape. When he made the tape for Cas, he didn’t know what he was trying to say. There’s the Earth-trampling guitars of Immigrant Song leading into the retelling of
“Marry me,” Dean blurts out as soon as Cas drops the croutons into the cart.
“I’m sorry, boys,” The woman says, shrugging apologetically. “There’s only one room. It has two queens, if that would help.”
“I’m sorry, Dean,” Cas’s voice says from somewhere.
A storm blows through overnight, the wind rattles the motel’s windows and walls. The room is cold and musty, and Dean is shivering, pressed tightly against the back of the lumpy, uncomfortable sofa. He wasn’t expecting to get much sleep anyways, and the stop is only for Cas’s sake, but at this rate, he might as well sleep in the car. A particularly strong burst of lightning fills the room, and Dean buries his head under the blankets and tries to tune out the sound of the wind and the thunder.
There’s a hardness to Cas that Dean hasn’t seen in years. He thinks back to those early days, over a decade prior, where he had no idea how to approach Cas, an otherworldly being in every way. Even back then, when his unflinching glare and single-minded righteousness could break the world effortlessly, Cas was still unreservedly gentle towards Dean. But now when Dean looks at him, Cas’s expression is devoid of any affection or care and that strikes Dean through the core.
“The Empty is of my control, Dean,” Billie says immediately.
Dean looks at Jack, who pouts at him. Dean shakes his head and grins. “I know, buddy. We’ll get him.”
“Wait a minute, there might be a way,” Dean says, a momentary burst of excitement bubbling in him.
Dean exchanges a look with Cas and Sam before turning to Billie. The fleeting illusion of security that he’s been holding on to disappears instantly. He says, “Hold up, can you tell us what the endgame is? We’re sending the kid into these quests with no idea what we’re getting ourselves into.”
Dean rolls his eyes, but mock salutes.
Dean closes his laptop and sighs. He fixes Cas a look. “We’ll find a way to fix it.”
Amara frowns, eyeing the diagram carefully. She doesn’t say anything for a moment, her gaze flickering between the diagram and Dean’s face. The corners of her mouth quirk up into a half-smile and she says, “You’re playing with fire, Dean — but, I think I can do this for you.”
Sam nods and turns to Cas. “Do you, Castiel, take Dean Winchester to be your non-lawful wedded husband, to have and to hold, from this day forward, for better, for worse, for richer, for poorer, in sickness and in health, until death do you part?”
“No, you aren’t,” Cas says immediately. He reaches a hand out to cup Dean’s face
, Jack had said. Dean studies Cas carefully and tries to determine if it’s the real Cas. The shape in front of him still has his eyes closed, curling in on himself. Dean doesn’t know how he knows this is Cas, but he just does. This is Cas — this is his Cas.
“How is The Empty?” Dean asks when there’s a lull in the conversation. He knows Cas is still awake.
“Dean, what are you saying?” Cas asks, squinting at him.
“So, you mean to tell me that you weren’t expecting a teenager in the place of a newborn?” Dean laughs.
“Stop.”
Cas hums. “Sounds good to me.”
“Claire, Jack,” Dean lists off with his fingers.
Cas reaches out again, touches his elbow, but Dean turns around and steps out of his reach. Dean lets out another shaky breath and walks out of the room.
,” Patricia exasperates as Cas guides her out of the room.
Still, there’s people that didn’t make it. He misses Bobby — his Bobby — like hell. He misses his Charlie, too. She would have been his best man without doubt. There’s Ellen, Jo, and Ash. There’s Kevin — God, he misses Kevin. Crowley would have made the wedding infinitely more chaotic, but sometimes Dean misses him too. The journey to this exact moment was so long, but it’s finally all his. Even through the grief that’ll never really go away, he’s just so
The cabin is eerily quiet. Jack occasionally comes out of his room and puts up a hand in greeting, but generally passes by without saying much of anything. Dean knows that he should probably talk to him, but he also knows that Jack doesn’t deal well with being pushed to talk, especially since he’s lost his soul. Several glasses of whiskey in, Dean calls Cas to check in on the case in Sioux Falls, but it goes straight to voicemail which, obviously, it does. Feeling restless and bored, Dean decides to call Sam, which ends up being a bit of a mistake.
“Are you sure you’re okay with this?”
“I’m here if you want to talk about whatever you’re being strange about,” Cas says, rolling his eyes, but sounding genuine nonetheless. Dean just nods, even if he has no intention of not being weird about this. Cas doesn’t seem to want an answer though because he just continues, “Sam sent over all the paperwork we need to get Jack into school, and it’s still early enough in the year that we might be able to get him enrolled.”
“We should give Cas a birthday,” Jack tells him with all the seriousness in the world.
Cas freezes on the stairs. "Of course. I promised Jack that I'll be back in three days."
, Dean tells himself.
Cas lets out a soft, wet breath against his chest, pulling a loose string on Dean’s t-shirt. “It’s dark and disconcertingly quiet. Angels and demons sleep for an eternity, but it’s not a peaceful sleep. They’re haunted by the memories of their greatest regrets —” Cas hesitates; he blinks up at Dean. “I think that’s the part that worries me the most. The regrets I have — well, I suppose I can’t say they would kill me because I would be dead already, but it would feel like eternal torture.”
Dean can’t keep the smile off his face when he says, “That’s the only reason, right?”
"I do," Sam says. "Rowena."
fine. And I can’t lose him again, man, not when —” Dean hesitates, inhaling sharply. “Not when I just got him back.”
A bright light explodes all around him, and Dean finds himself in a void of emptiness.
“Sam, come on,” Dean says softly. “You have to call her.”
“I know,” Dean tells him. He’s heard sounds coming out of Jack’s room more times than he wants to count, and he’s had to pull Jack awake on more than one occasion. Dean scans the room and his eyes settle on the light flickering in from the hallway. “We should get away.” Cas knits his brows and squints. Dean clarifies, “We should go on a vacation. Get out of the bunker, you know? Grab Sam and Eileen — maybe, Claire, if she’s up for that kinda thing.”
Dean huffs out a laugh. Cas has this incredible way of talking him down from whatever ledge he’s on at any given time. He doesn’t even know what he could say to thank Cas for it, so he says the only thing he can. “Thank you, Cas.”
“And you did a very good job with that,” Cas tells him, completely seriously. He looks at Dean with such earnest fondness that Dean has to look away. He knows he did a good job with Sam - hell, he probably did more than a good job with Sam, but to hear Cas say it makes his chest constrict. When he looks at Cas, he’s still giving him the same, warm, look. Dean says, “Thank you, Cas. You’re not bad at this yourself.”
“Sorry,” Cas says, voice rough with sleep. “I struggled on the case with Claire. I don’t know what’s happening with my powers, but I can’t seem to do much of anything.”
They’re halfway out the room, hand in hand, when Sam groans, “Seriously?”
he thinks because that’s an incredible feeling, that all the bullshit that he’s put Cas through over the years hasn't scared him away. Cas saw all the anger and rage and decided that he still loves Dean.
Cas squeezes his hand again and looks at him so fondly that Dean feels his heart thudding, everything feels just a little bit brighter. He says, “I love you, too. I don’t — uh, I know I don’t say it often enough, but I would have been long dead without you.”
“How long?” Cas asks, and Dean pulls back to eye him curiously. Cas chuckles softly and mouths at Dean’s jaw. “It’s a simple question, Dean.”
Cas hums in quiet acknowledgment; it’s the obvious, Dean knows that, but he also knows that sometimes you need to be reminded of the obvious. Chuck isn’t writing their lives anymore, The Empty can’t get you, the world is as safe as it’ll ever be — Dean knows that, Cas knows that, but sometimes they just need a reminder.
“We will,” Dean says quickly. He almost wants to shove Sam out the bunker to make him get on with it.
“That has to be the last one for a while,” Dean says as they make their way back to the bunker. “We’ll put Jody and the girls on hunts if we need to, but until we figure out what to do about Chuck, we’re staying home.”
"We're not coming back to the bunker, Dean," Cas says with a heavy sigh, shaking his head.
Cas smiles up at him, sweet in a way only he could manage. “Thank you, Dean.”
“I’m not giving up, Sam,” Dean says quickly because he’s not. Far from it. “I just don’t know what I’ll do with myself when the inevitable happens.”
They take on a case in Arkansas that involves a creature feeding on young children. At first, Dean didn’t know why they were taking on cases when they have so much on their plates, but he’s never been able to turn away from cases that involved children. Cas and Jack come along, even though both are still limited. Eileen also tags along, and she’s easily the best of them right now. It’s a tense case, drawing on all their emotions, and rendering them exhausted by the end of it.
“Dean,” Sam starts. When Dean looks at him, Sam gives him a withering look. “You need to stop Jack from doing this.”
“Well, yes,” Cas deadpans. “I did literally pull you out of hell.”
Sam just hums, the corners of his mouth quirking up into a smile. He tries for subtlety, but that lasts about five seconds before he’s fully grinning. “You should see yourself from the outside, man.”
“Hey, kid,” Dean says, feeling his nerves catch up to him. He drops down across Jack at the table. When Jack stares at him expectantly, Dean clears his throat. “Listen, Jack, I need you to promise me something; if you sense anything wrong, even the vaguest inclination that something is out of the ordinary, I want you and Cas to turn back.”
“Dean, just go to sleep,” Cas murmurs. When Dean looks at him, his own eyes are closed. Without opening them, he says, “We had a long day.”
Cas smiles against his chest. “I did learn that from you.”
“Shut up,” Dean mutters. He turns to Sam and says, “Can I kiss him already?”
Rowena pinches the bridge of her nose. “I suppose you’re right and it could be a metaphor, and a replacement could do, but —”
Dean actually laughs at that, and Eileen presses play on the next episode.
“So, what’s the plan?” Sam asks, breaking the tension in the room.
Dean wipes his eyes with the back of his hand. “Even if you can’t do anything about him, it would be good to see you again, Jack.”
"I know," Cas says, finally breaking his silence. Dean watches Cas scan the bunker before setting his sight on Dean. "Where's Sam?"
“We have three minutes until Amara will arrive,” Rowena says darkly.
“Yes, you can,” Cas tells him firmly. “You’ve fought so much over the years, and this is just another thing that we need to get through.”
Nerves flicker over Sam’s face suddenly. “Right, guess I’m doing this, then.”
Again, then. It’s the most common one. Dean says, “It can’t get you anymore, you know.”
Dean is shaking, his own emotions about to burst out of him and Cas has to place a gentle hand on his shoulder to bring him back to his senses. Dean croaks, “Fuck you. Now I’m crying.”
Cas hunches his shoulders and looks away. “What if you can’t?”
Dean frowns. “It’s complicated.”
“So, who’s picking the movie?” Sam asks, not looking up from his book. Eileen drops down onto Sam’s legs; he lets out a loud groan, moving so that he’s sitting half up and Eileen is half laying down on top of him. Before Dean can say anything though, Sam adds, “Not Dean because we are not watching The Lost Boys again.”
"Right," Dean nods. "Call me if you need help?" He means for it to be a statement, but it comes out as a question anyway.
Amara laughs, low, shaking her head in amusement. “Oh Dean, do you think you found me? I let you find me because I have information that might be of use to you.”
Dean doesn’t know how to pray to Jack.
“Dean?”
“Billie approached me while I was having my Tuesday afternoon massage telling me that you boys need help,” Rowena explains, flipping through the pages of the spellbook. “Of course, I could never say no to that. This is the Draíocht Dhiaga — an ancient, Celtic spell book that has been kept in Hell for millennia, and we think that this might solve our collective problems when it comes to God.”
“But, we’re here,” Cas says softly.
“About fucking time,” Dean practically shouts when he sees her.
Dean snorts. Figures that he would get radio silence from Cas for weeks on end, and when Cas finally comes back to the bunker, he's looking for
It’s pretty funny how Sam’s face tries to contort in anger at Dean not telling him, except it doesn’t actually do that because he’s so happy. He clears his throat. “I am definitely going to kill you guys for not telling me sooner, but wow, that’s amazing.”
“Woah,” Jack says, passing his hands in front of his face. He turns to Dean and says, “I feel like I’m on fire.”
“Oh well, we could leave,” Dean snickers, as they walk down the stairs. “Sammy doesn’t get laid often, so you know —”
They both turn around to look at Jack because he’s always the one to break the tie. Jack looks up from his homework and says, “The second one.”
Sam calls them after dinner when they’re in the middle of changing Jack into his pajamas. It rings four times before Dean manages to get to his phone; he puts it on speaker and drops the phone to the table.
“He told me that he loved me, and that just saying it was enough for The Empty to get him,” Dean bites out. He feels like throwing up. “I didn’t have time to say anything back.”
“I can’t believe he ate it,” Dean says, rubbing his face in his hands.
Sam nods and unscrews the vial and drops it in. He looks at Rowena for instruction. She reaches out to take Sam’s hand. Her voice is precise and calm when she says, “Listen to me carefully — all of you. Sam, the spell is in Gaelic, so you must focus on your pronunciation. Any mistake, and we will not be able to bind him. Do you understand?” Sam lets out a sharp breath and nods. Then, Rowena turns to Jack, her face softening immediately. “Jack, my boy. I do hate the burden of responsibility we’re putting on you.”
Almost right on cue, Jack strolls into the main room, his Nintendo Switch in hand. He waves at Sam and Dean before he drops down on a chair, looking down at his game.
Dean closes his eyes, knowing that at any minute, footsteps will run down the hallway and Sam will peer into the room, a look of disappointment on his face, but they won’t talk about it.
“I don’t think I can save you, Cas,” Dean says quietly into the emptiness of the room.
Dean shakes his head. “What, you can’t read my mind?”
“But, Dean,” Jack says, slowly, his face pinches in confusion. “You were there for me. You took care of me when I was sick, you taught me to drive, and you said
Cas’s recovery takes a bit longer than expected. Jack insists it’s because of humanity catching up to him. He akins it to creating the first humans; Cas is in a new body that’s his own, without his grace, and needs to figure it out all over again. Dean is there every step of the way. He still remembers the last time Cas turned human, and Dean feels terrible whenever he remembers that. It bites at him that for the last twelve years, all Dean has done was disappoint Cas, especially when Cas was human.
Dean doesn't know why he didn't realize it sooner, but Cas looks
Dean turns towards his door to find Sam standing in the hallway, his eyes darting between Dean, the whiskey bottle, and the books. Dean struggles to control the sickening wave of fear rising through him.
“Better,” Cas confirms, trying to blink the sleep out of his eyes. “It seems that human beings need way more rest than your habits have led me to believe.”
Dean hums to signal that he’s awake. Cas shifts so that he’s turning so that their bodies press up together until he’s close enough that Dean can make out every speck in his blue eyes, even in the dark. Dean’s gaze dips to where Cas’s collarbone peeks out of his shirt. Dean trails back up, meeting Cas’s eyes.
Dean curls up on his side and drapes his throw blanket over his lower torso, unperturbed by the state of the world. He doesn’t know how long he lies there, staring up at the ceiling, but he knows it’s been a day, maybe longer. There’s quiet whispering outside his door, but Dean doesn’t move. He tugs his blanket more tightly around himself.
Cas is so much, always. It sometimes hits Dean suddenly that Cas is this multidimensional wave of celestial intent dressed in a trench coat who lives down the hall from him, and Dean couldn’t be luckier for it. He doesn’t know what he’s done to deserve someone so otherworldly finding it in himself to spend time with Dean, even if it’s temporary.
“Don’t say anything,” Sam says, more than a little defensive.
There’s a whiskey bottle stashed under the bed that Dean hasn’t touched in three weeks, which is the longest bout of sobriety he’s had in at least two decades. He manages to dodge Cas and Jack when they get back to the bunker to sneak into the room. He pulls it out to eye the golden brown liquid.
Dean flushes. “What’s that supposed to mean?”
"Hello," Jack says, voice clear as day in the empty church, as he raises one hand in greeting. Dean doesn’t know what to look at; his eyes flicker back and forth between the dead body and Jack before settling on Jack’s face. There’s a lengthy silence between the three of them, but Jack steps forward and says, “I can explain.”
Jack eyes Dean carefully, and just for the briefest moment, a flash of guilt spreads across his face. It dissipates so quickly that if Dean hadn't known better, he would have missed it.
“Of course,” Cas agrees politely.
Billie stares at Cas with sharp eyes. “Yes, I do. It was a stupid move, if you ask me.”
Dean snorts. “Yeah, that went really well.”
“Cas, sweetheart, enjoy the moment,” Dean says, with an exasperated sigh.
Dean opens his eyes, and focuses on his room. He sighs and gets up. There’s a million problems in the world right now, and he should know better than expect Jack to pop in at a whim, especially not when Dean tried turning him into a bomb less than a month ago. If he was in Jack’s place, he wouldn’t bother either.
Dean hums, lazily dropping his hands to Cas’s waist, dipping inside his suit jacket. “Just thinking about how long it took us to get here.”
“Well, maybe we learned something from our terrible choices this time around,” Dean says, wryly. It almost gets a smile out of Cas, which he’ll take as a win. Dean doesn’t know what possesses him to reach one hand up, tracing Cas’s cheekbones lightly. He can feel Cas trailing the movement with his eyes, but Dean doesn’t drop his hand. “I’m sorry I didn’t give you a chance to save him. I just hope you can forgive me for that one day.”
“Thank you, Jack,” Dean chokes out. Cas had said that despite everything, Jack still cares about his love, and Dean doesn’t know what he did to deserve that. Hell, he doesn’t deserve it, but Jack is willing to offer it anyway. Dean tries smiling. “We will get your soul back. I promise you that.”
Cas gives him a look. “I don’t
makes him feel. He doesn’t even know why Cas is sleeping in the first place.
“I just want you to be okay and I want you to stay, and I don’t give a crap if you can’t go on hunts anymore,” Dean says, trying to keep his voice from wavering but failing at it. “I don’t know what I need to do to convince you that I want you around because you’re you and not because you can do something useful.”
Dean presses his lips together and narrows his eyes at her, his temper flaring slightly. He can’t keep the frustration out of his voice when he says, “He locked you up for eons.”
Cas hums into the kiss. “I thought it was practical.”
, what did you think was going to happen? You needed a soul bomb to take out Amara, and that was when she was significantly weakened by your band of merry misfits. Chuck, even with a magic bullet wound, is still devouring worlds at an alarming pace. This is the only way.”
“I don’t know,” Cas says softly. “You, probably —” Dean smiles despite himself. “But, I suppose saving Jack and defeating Chuck would make me feel content enough. I’d like to know that you and Sam will be okay and that Jack has a home where he’s safe.”
Billie rolls her eyes. “Yes, Castiel, okay. I will reach out to my contacts and figure out an alternate path, but I do have to warn you that whatever it is could be dangerous. With the original plan, Jack’s life is the only life that would be at risk, but there’s every chance that we could be messing with some intense magic. You have to be prepared.”
“I have to do this, Cas,” Jack says, tilting his chin up as he looks at Cas with steely determination. “Please don’t try and stop me.”
Dean immediately closes his eyes and tries to blink away the wetness pooling in his eyes. When he opens his eyes again, Cas's mouth is flat. He studies Dean with a sharp precision that only Cas can manage, and Dean feels like his insides are on fire. The way Cas can see right through him, no matter how many barriers he puts up, will always get to him. Cas has seen every inch of his soul, several times over, and he’s never looked as resigned as he does in this moment.
Dean thinks that he should probably argue, say that’s unnecessary and that the couch is absolutely fine, but he doesn't. He gets up, pulls his blanket around his shoulder like a cape, and crosses across the room, each step stiffer than the last. The bed creaks when Dean settles down on his side. Cas shifts slightly, moving the sheets so that he’s more comfortable. Dean focuses on the steady sound of Cas’s breathing just to avoid thinking about anything else, like the heat radiating off Cas’s body.
He can see the gears turning in Cas's head and the silent debate he's having with himself, and Dean feels a little sick at the thought that whatever it is that Cas is here for, he can't trust Dean with it. Or maybe he can, but he doesn't want to and somehow that feels even worse.
“Sure,” Dean agrees. He loves the stupid trench coat more than he’ll ever admit. Dean kisses Cas again for good measure because that’s a thing he can just do now.
No response. Dean pulls out the half-empty decanter from his bedside table. He drinks and drinks and he doesn’t stop until he empties the bottle, the cool liquid burns as it trickles down his throat. Dean can feel his hands tremble under him and his eyes burn with tears that he refuses to shed. Against his better judgment, he throws the bottle down, and it shatters against the tile floor, the glass flying off the ground, a piece nearly hitting Dean’s eye.
“But you can fix it, right?” Jack asks. “You’ll fix it, and we’ll go back to the bunker, and everything will be back to normal, right?”
Dean just stares at him incredulously. “As long as you’re alive, that’s all that matters. Even at the expense of your powers.”
“Well, that’s settled,” Dean says, feeling oddly tense. “What’s next?”
, Dean thinks as he walks through the vast, horrifying nothingness.
Dean blinks up at the room and registers Sam, Eileen, and Jack looking down at him. He croaks, “What the hell was that?”
“The catch?”
Eileen signs. She smiles gently as she looks over his face. “What happened?”
Yeah, Dean is
He can feel Cas studying him in the dark. “Jack is struggling too.”
“Okay,” Dean repeats. He can work with okay.
, Dean thinks. He could just let Cas walk away again, knowing full well that it would probably be another month, maybe longer, before he sees him again. But, Cas deserves that, doesn’t he? He left, so Dean shouldn’t call after him. Except —
“But, I do have an option for you,” Billie says slowly. Dean whips his head up to look at her. Billie bites her lip and looks away from him and directly at Cas, who tilts his head to the side in confusion. Billie sighs and pulls out a vial filled with blue-white fog and recognition flickers across Cas’s face. She walks over and hands the vial of grace back to Cas.
Dean doesn’t actually know what one looks for in the prefect ring. He eyes Cas carefully, trying to gauge his reaction, but all Cas does is tilt his head to the side and squint at the pictures of the two rings on Sam’s phone.
“Good morning, Eileen,” Cas says, signing with practiced precision.
Jack tilts his head and narrows his eyes in concentration, or as much concentration a two year old can manage and says, “Yes!”
“You don’t have to talk about it if you don’t want to, but it might help you work through it if you do,” Dean offers again.
"Wait," Dean calls out, pushing himself off his chair to follow Cas towards the stairs, and grabs Cas’s arm to stop him. When Cas turns his head around, his eyes flash with anger. Dean immediately drops his hand and Cas follows the movement with his eyes before he looks at Dean again. The moment stretches before them and Dean feels like he’s being pulled apart seam by seam under the weight of Cas’s stare; each passing moment feels longer than the last. Dean swallows hard and says, "Did you want something?"
Sam returns a couple of hours later with a vial of purple fluid. Jack eyes it apprehensively, but he stays relatively calm, while Cas injects him with it. He immediately keels over, and Dean feels a twist of worry in his gut, but then Jack slowly starts aging up. They put him in Dean’s oversized shirt, so at least he has some dignity while he returns to normal.
Dean swallows hard and tries to plead with just his eyes. Cas, who probably knows him better than anyone else, gives him a flat look, his mouth twisting wryly. He says, "I don't know anything, actually. Time and time again, you push me away, and whenever things go wrong, you lash out at me. I don’t deserve that, Dean.”
“Something like that,” Dean agrees. He clears his throat and picks one of the chips from the bowl between them. He asks, “Okay, now that we got our chick flick moment out of the way, spill. What’s going on with The Empty?”
Dean gapes, feels his face warm, and shakes his head. “Yeah — yeah, okay. You better make it back alive.”
Dean freezes at that. Jack raises a brow at him, challenging him to deny it, but Dean can’t. Of course, he would do it. He would lay down his own life in a heartbeat if it means that they can get Chuck. It’s funny, Dean thinks, how easily they all run towards their own deaths, but can’t accept it if anyone else makes that choice.
“Where’d you learn how to do that?” Dean asks, looking down at where Cas has finished installing the new toilet in their bathroom. The bathroom itself is mostly finished; they finished painting the walls a pale blue, the shower has a new shower head, and Dean managed to put together a nice enough counter.
. No matter how hard he tries, he can never put a label on what Cas is to him. He’s everything.
Dean blinks, smiling despite himself. “I knew I liked you.”
“We’re just waiting on Rowena,” Sam says, not looking up from where he’s mixing some myrrh and cassia. There’s less than an hour before Amara is scheduled to bring Chuck to the bunker. Dean taps his fingers on the table, feeling the anxiety rise. Sam finally stands up and looks over his handiwork. He turns to Dean. “Once she gets back from Hell, I’ll recite the incantation and Rowena will use her magic. Jack would have about a minute to snap his fingers.”
Dean nods, squeezing the hand on Jack’s shoulder before he gets up off the bed. He’s halfway to the door when Jack says, “Dean?”
“I was just thinking,” Dean admits, nodding towards Jack. “He’s so little.”
“Jack, you do know that —” Cas starts, but then Jack looks up at him with big, blue eyes and Dean knows that Jack won. “Of course, Jack. When should my birthday be?”
that hangs in the air between them.
Dean glares at his watch. He could swear that time is moving slower than ever. When the timer runs down to two minutes, Dean approaches the body. Jack has the vial with Cas’s grace in his hands. Thirty seconds.
“And everything,” Dean finishes for him because
“That day in the kitchen when you asked me if you were the only one that felt something between us, I told you that I was sorry,” Cas says hesitantly. Dean closes his eyes and feels the wetness on his face. He only opens his eyes again because he feels Cas’s hand reaching out to his as he laces their fingers together. “I believe I made you feel like I didn’t feel the same way, but that’s not true. I — I love you. I’ve loved you for as long as I’ve known you, even if I didn’t realize it.”
Considering the state of their lives at any given moment and the fact that they didn’t actually want a traditional wedding, Dean should be glad that the wedding isn’t as chaotic as it could have been. Nobody dies, which is nice, and as far as serious injuries are considered, the sleeve of Sam’s suit catching on fire isn’t the worst. If Dean really thinks about it, weddings don’t usually go wrong when the people involved in them actually want to be there.
“You let him win,” Cas accuses later when Jack leaves the kitchen.
Sam immediately whips his head around to where Jack’s voice rings out. It takes a moment for Sam to register what he’s looking at and then his face splits into a huge smile as he dashes across the room to hug Jack. He says, “I knew you’d come back.”
Dean is about to argue that
“No,” Dean repeats. “I’m done.”
“I’m seeing Eileen tomorrow,” Sam says, not looking up from his tablet.
“Do you want to hear the story of Daniel in the lion’s den?” Cas asks Jack, whose only response is to stare at Cas and blow a spit bubble. Cas laughs. “I’ll take that as a yes.”
Cas pulls away to look at him, his eyes bright and happy. “Since the beginning, Dean.”
When Patricia and Cas walk into the kitchen, Jack immediately tucks the EMF meter away and smiles his trademark smile and says, “Patricia, what can you tell us about the ghost haunting the house?”
Dean grins smugly. “Ha.”
Sam looks between them before he walks down the hallway. Dean inhales sharply, focusing on steadying his breath. He can do this; he
Cas beams next to him.
“Okay, hold on. Let's get you up,” Dean says, helping Jack sit up. He cups Jack’s face and meets his eyes. Despite having all the power in the universe, he looks exhausted. Without thinking, Dean pulls him into a tight hug. Jack hesitates for a moment before wrapping his arms around Dean. “Hey, kid.”
Jack glares at him. “
“How’d it go?” Eileen asks, looking through Rowena’s book.
Cas stays quiet as Dean tugs them back towards the bunker, through the trees and weeds. It’s not until they’re almost home that Cas pulls Dean’s hand, stopping them, before he says, “Do you want to talk about it?”
“Fair enough,” Sam concedes. Eileen strolls into the room with her duffle bag, and Sam’s face immediately lights up. “Hey, ready to go?”
Dean slumps his shoulders. He knows he should just rip the bandaid off, but every time he thinks about Jack, all he can see is the box and the gun, and the shame washes over him, skating over his skin like a scar; but, Cas is looking at him with such gentle hope that Dean says, “Okay, I will.”
“Hear me out,” Dean says, feeling more than a little hysterical. Dean feels his face warming, but he pushes on. “I know I haven’t always been the greatest, but you always make me want to be the best version of myself, and if you give me the chance, I would really like to spend the rest of my life with you.  Cas —
. Nothing human can exist in The Empty and it can’t come to Earth unless it’s summoned.”
“Taking care of kids is hard, man,” Dean says, and Cas hums in agreement.
“Eating and sex,” Cas tells him, swatting his hand away, not opening his eyes. Well, okay then. Cas likes sex. He can work with that, maybe. One day. Dean leans back against the headboard. Cas’s breath immediately steadies again; he’s not asleep, not really, but Dean can tell that he wants to rest a bit longer.
"Are you okay?" Dean asks as they make their way up the stairs to the Sheriff's office. Even though they're actively looking for him, Jack still remains a very sore subject, and Dean doesn't want to push those buttons if he's going to regret it later. When Cas doesn't say anything, Dean tries again. "You know, what happened with Jack was a tragedy."
“What?” Dean rasps out.
“No, it doesn’t,” Sam quips, scratching the back of his neck. He eyes Jack. “Will Dean be okay in The Empty?”
“Yes, that’s quite common in the movies you like to watch when you think nobody is looking,” Cas says, tipping his head to the side and blinking the water out of his eyes. “Though, I will say that we’re both probably going to get sick if we stay here any longer.”
“No sleep,” Jack says against Dean’s chest.
The room is the standard Winchester fare. It’s small, consisting of two queen beds with bright orange sheets. A dusty olive carpet covers the floor, and the smell of cigarettes hangs in the air. Dean wrinkles his nose, takes his laptop out gently, before dropping his duffle bag in the corner. He makes a beeline for the shower.
“I’m sure, Dean,” Sam tells him as he brings another box out into the main room of the bunker. He looks at Dean, knits his brows together, and gives him a look. “Are you sure
to do this. When Jack looks at him expectantly, not saying anything, Dean continues, “Look, kid. I know there’s a lot of bad blood between us, and I know you have no business forgiving me, but I wanna try and do right by you.”
Dean knows his face is probably bright red. He ducks his head and scratches the back of his neck. “A bit hard when one of us is legally dead and one of us technically doesn’t exist.” Sam is still staring at him with the same expression so Dean concedes, “Yeah, okay, consider it considered.”
Dean exhales slowly before he says, “Someone I care about made a deal with it, and I would like to get him out of it.”
“There’s a case about an hour away,” Jack says as soon as they cross state lines back into Kansas. Dean instinctively grips the steering wheel tighter, his knuckles whitening in front of him. Jack, for his part, doesn’t notice anything. Dean can barely make out the kid scrolling through his phone in the backseat in the rear view mirror. He continues, “It’s at a school and according to this, it might be a ghost or a revenant.”
Cas still doesn’t open his eyes. Dean inhales sharply. “Jack tried breaking you out, but it didn’t work, and he thought I could do it. I don’t know why the kid has that much faith in me, or why you do, when I’ve done nothing to deserve that.”
“How touching.”
Dean doesn’t know what to expect when Cas calls in the middle of a routine hunt insisting that they have an emergency at hand, and that Dean should return to the bunker immediately. He barely makes it into the bunker before he freezes on top of the stairs, nearly causing Sam to collide into him.
“What if you can’t?” Cas asks again, wrapping his arms tightly around himself. “What if you can’t fix me?” There’s a tremble in his voice as he speaks. “What if — Dean, what if my powers continue failing and I can’t get them back?”
Dean blinks at the woman who sits down next to him. She has short, brown hair that frames her pale face. She hands over a kite to a boy that looks about five years old, give or take. Even though they don’t get out much, it’s pretty easy to know who everyone is in Lebanon, and he’s never seen her around. Dean clears his throat. “Hey.”
"Okay," Cas echoes him. His eyes don’t look furious anymore; instead, when Dean catches his eyes, he can see Cas’s hurt. His mouth is drawn in a thin line as he turns away to walk up the stairs.
, Dean thinks. They’re already off to a great start.
Dean scratches the back of his neck. “Trust me, there’s nothing I want more than Chuck meeting his end, but just give us some time to find another way.”
“I’m sorry,” Cas says quietly. Dean blinks down at Cas; he doesn’t have a clue what they’re talking about. Cas drifts closer, however impossible that is, their bodies slotting together easily. Cas lets out a soft breath, looking Dean in the eye. “I should have told you about Jack.”
“Somewhere,” Dean says, waving around the bunker. Billie just stares him down. Dean rolls his eyes and shouts, “Jack! You have a visitor!”
The scene in front of him is so comedic that he almost thinks Gabriel zapped them into some movie. There’s Cas, with his hair in fifty directions and a scowl on his face, chasing after a toddler with mousy brown hair that’s currently drowning in one of Dean’s t-shirts. It takes Dean a minute, but when the boy smiles, it becomes obvious. Dean exchanges a look with Sam, who just shrugs.
Billie eyes him. “He’s more likely to deal with Jack.”
?” Dean asks, voice rising an octave. Cas just shrugs, go figure. Dean shakes his head. “No way. Absolutely not. You just got your strength back, and it’s not even all back.”
“For fucks sake, Dean,” Sam says, practically shouting now. Dean refuses to look up from the cutting board. Sam lowers his voice just a fraction when he says, “I can’t forget about how you tried to kill yourself the last time Cas died, so forgive me for being worried.” Dean darts his eyes up to meet Sam’s. His eyes are watery and his bottom lip quivers. “Please, just tell me what happened.”
He knows that Cas is studying him from the corner of his eyes, but he doesn’t say anything. Instead, he stands up and rubs his hands on his jeans before reaching a hand out. Dean immediately takes it and lets Cas pull him up. Cas squeezes his hand, and Dean feels a rush of gratitude surge through him and feels Cas anchoring him to the then and now.
He doesn’t look back at Sam as he leaves the room, even as Sam calls after him. He locks the door behind him before dropping down on the bed; the dim light in the corner casts a foggy haze over the room, and Dean shuts his eyes.
Dean shrugs. “If you mean, is he emotionally fine? Probably not, but I told him to give us time to figure this out.”
“That sounds nice, Dean,” Sam says softly.
?” He lets out a strangled laugh. Dean knows he’s losing any grasp of himself with each word he says, but he doesn’t care. If he could shout, he would. He chokes out, “You said the one thing you want was something you can’t have, but you never asked me. You didn’t let me say my piece.”
Cas is curled up tightly in one of the chairs in the library, using his trench coat as a blanket. Sam is sitting at the table, laptop opened in front of him, and Dean drops down across from Sam, opening his own computer. Dean watches Cas rub his eyes, attempt to crack his knuckles, mutter something to himself, and change positions in the chair. It’s only after Cas lets out a frustrated sigh that Dean finally asks, “Are you okay, buddy?”
Dean shakes his head. “Cas, come on. That’s crazy.”
“Hey.”
“I’m sure we can manage,” Cas says over the phone when Dean walks over. When he spots Dean, he puts the phone back on speaker and says, “Sam is explaining that he found a way to track the demigod down, but it might be too late to try and get him tonight.”
to do this. Mary was always going to be a sore topic between them, but Dean can’t run from it forever. Not when Jack, soulless and an actual child, is willing to talk about it. Dean meets Jack’s eyes and nods slowly.
"Hey, kid," Dean says, completely unable to keep his voice from wavering. He blinks rapidly, trying not to tear up. "It's been a while.”
“Don’t worry, I already obtained all the math taught in the American school system,” Jack explains, waving to a teacher that passes by. “I couldn’t absorb history or literature because my powers aren’t as strong as they were.”
“Rowena is trying to come up with a spell,” Sam explains over the phone. “If it works, we’ll be able to bind him and hopefully convince him to give us the serum to turn Jack back. If we can’t convince him nicely - well, you know.”
“I beat Sam as well,” Jack points out. Dean bites back a laugh. Jack gives him a shit-eating, absolutely top-level, smug grin. “I bet I can beat you too.”
“Sam, relax. We aren’t getting married,” Cas cuts him off. Dean freezes. Well, shit, that throws his perfect, perfect,
“I’m fine, Cas.”
Dean slumps down back on to his chair as Jack goes back to his homework. Cas returns to the book he’s reading, eyeing Sam. “Well?”
Cas looks at Dean with wide, stunned eyes, like this is something he never thought he’d hear, which is absolutely fair because Dean never thought he’d get a chance to say it. He opens his mouth and closes it again. When the words don’t come to him, Cas surges forward to take Dean’s face in both hands, and kisses him.
Jack’s eyes immediately snap away from the wall towards Dean. When he doesn’t say anything, Dean steps inside the room gingerly, closing the door behind him.
kill him.”
Sam arches his brow. “So, ask him.”
“Dean —”
“Don’t overthink it,” Sam says firmly, giving Dean a look. Then, he shoots an absolute shit eating grin at Dean. “We could have a joint wedding.”
“I’m  glad that you and Cas finally ‘figured yourselves out’, as Sam would say,” Jack tells him. Dean immediately balks; he dares to take a look at Cas, who is looking pointedly down at the floor, the tips of his ears turning a light shade of pink. Jack blinks at them. “Did I say something wrong?”
He loves the bunker, he does. It’s been the closest to a home he’s ever had, but he would be lying if it’s not cold and clinical sometimes. Every corner he turns, there’s a reminder of the things they’ve all gone through. They’ve all nearly died in the bunker, nearly killed each other in the bunker, and it’s just time to move on, time to build something somewhere else.
Dean blinks. “You downloaded
Dean swallows hard and blinks away the emotions threatening to break through. He chokes, “You can’t just say things like that.”
Cas looks away from him, frowning at the floor.
“Yeah, are you okay?” Dean asks. Cas runs a hand through his hair before fixing his tie. Dean says, “You scared the hell out of me, man.”
“I know, Dean,” Cas says softly.
,” Dean says at the same time that Cas says, “Jack, your time will come, and even if it doesn’t, that’s okay too.”
Dean considers his words very carefully. “I mean that if you get to Santa Fe, and this Adam seems dangerous, I want you to get back to the bunker and wait for reinforcements. Cas is going to be graceless and —” Dean freezes, unable to get the words out.
Cas tilts his head to the side and squints up at him. “So, you don’t want to marry me?”
Cas smiles at him softly. “You might never believe me, Dean, but the things I’ve shared with you are far more important to me than anything else.”
At the edge of the lot, there’s a circle of tall trees, their leaves turning a burnt orange shade as they fall to the ground. Dean can feel the heaviness settle into his head as he tries to focus on them. The hangovers are worse than they were, which definitely has something to do with age, but there’s also the fact that he’s no longer a character in one of Chuck’s twisted stories, so he’s feeling it.
Dean feels something unfold in him as he looks around the room. There’s a newfound sense of hope rush through him as he watches Sam kiss Eileen and Billie exchange a handshake with Rowena. It’s not until he catches sight of Cas, his face in profile looking a bit sad that Dean comes back down to Earth. He knows it’s probably the right thing to do, the brave thing to do, for Cas to give up his grace like that, but it doesn’t mean that it’s not profoundly unfair. He watches as Cas walks out of the room towards his bedroom.
“I’m doing it, and I literally don’t care if you’re not on board with this,” Dean snaps, raising his voice in the process. Sam’s eyes widen in momentary shock before settling into something more knowing. He nods slowly. Dean turns to Jack. “Alright, kid. What do I need to know?”
Dean thinks and drops to one knee.
"So Billie sprung him from The Empty as soon as Chuck went off-world?" Sam asks over the video call. Dean looks over Jack's shoulders at the laptop screen on the kitchen island in Cas's cabin. Sam's face is pinched in confusion and vague anxiety like he always seems to be sporting these days.
. That was the plan."
Dean opens his mouth to retort when Jack jumps off his chair and walks over. His eyes shine with excitement and he tilts his screen towards Dean. He says, “Dean, look, I found a surfboard in Nook’s Cranny.”
“Eileen and I can head down to Hell to figure out if Rowena has any information,” Sam offers, picking up his laptop and leaving the room.
Sam laughs.
Dean swings open the door and spots an elderly woman reading a newspaper in the dim glow of the office. Dean puts on his best smile and approaches the woman. “Hey, we’re looking to book two rooms.”
“Jack, I don’t think High School Musical is —” Dean starts, but Cas shoots him a reproachful look. Dean quickly amends, “I think that’s a great idea, Jack.”
Dean huffs out a low chuckle, feeling immediately better at the thought of Cas recovering. “I’m not exactly the most functional human out there.”
“We should take him back to the bunker,” Jack suggests.
“Chuck is almost done destroying all the other worlds. Once he’s done with them, it’ll be our turn, so we need to be prepared,” Billie says, darkly.
“He always takes your side,” Cas pouts. Jack looks at him innocently and Cas just shakes his head fondly. To Sam, he says, “Well, guess our consensus is the second one.”
Cas blinks. “Do we really need both of us? I think I can manage just fine.”
Cas immediately reaches a hand out to cover Jack’s eyes, but the damage is already done. Dean clears his throat. “Having fun, were we?”
A chill runs up Dean’s spine and he feels his heart stumble over its own rhythm. Jack's face flashes in his mind — bright eyes turning burnt and blackened, carefree smile turning heartbroken and betrayed. Jack is
“I’m sorry,” Dean says, softly, feeling his heart twist. He exhales sharply. “My uh — Cas died three weeks ago.” He says it like this random woman would know who Cas is, but it’s the best he can do. He tries again. “My brother thinks I’m losing it, and maybe I am. I keep thinking that I’m gonna wake up one day and see him squinting at his coffee in the morning, like he can somehow make the caffeine to work faster if he just glares at it hard enough.”
“No kidding,” Dean says. A part of him really hates that they couldn’t keep him like that a little while longer. “At least you’re back to normal.”
Jack’s eyes snap up and he looks at Dean.
Dean glares. “Alright, cut us some slack. Maybe if Chuck didn’t keep screwing with our lives, we’d actually stay dead for once.”
"Not this time," Dean says quietly, as he walks out of the kitchen. He’s pretty sure Sam calls after him again, but Dean tunes it out.
There’s a universal cliche about how you’re lost before you find your person, but Dean thinks there’s some truth to that. There’s a lot they still need to figure out, but they have a lifetime for that. It’s the first time in Dean’s long life that he feels like he has an anchor. He feels like he’s coming home after a long war, and in a lot of ways that’s exactly what happened.
“Grab Eileen, then,” Dean says, with a wave. Something dark crosses over Sam’s face, and Dean immediately narrows his eyes. “Dude.”
Dean blinks. “Huh.”
Jack’s face closes off, averting his gaze to the cold eggs on the kitchen island. “Not really.” He picks up his plate and walks up the stairs, and Dean can hear the bedroom door shutting in the distance.
“Yeah, well, Metatron did a number on him and now Heaven isn’t what it was,” Dean explains, trying not to give away how much that thought freaks him out. “At some point, I’m pretty sure all the remaining angels are going to be human, more or less.”
When Dean wakes up, he realizes that the whiskey bottle is gone. He also realizes the one he keeps hidden in his wardrobe is gone as well. It’s a miracle that he’s gone this long without realizing how out of his depth he is because the signs are all around him. A glance at his phone tells him that it’s a quarter after ten. He can smell the coffee as he walks down the hall towards the kitchen. As always, Cas is sitting at the table, newspaper open in front of him. Today, though, he also has his laptop.
Dean drops down across from him at the table. He shoots his most confident grin at Cas and says, “I love presents.”
“It’s not your choice,” Jack says, keeping his voice level. Cas exhales and his lips tremble.
Cas doesn’t look convinced, but he doesn’t say anything. Instead, he paces the kitchen, humming a tune under his breath. Dean wonders whether Cas can sing and what he would need to do to hear it if he can, but he doesn’t get a chance to think about it too long because the soup starts bubbling on the stove. It’s
"As you wish," Cas says before leaving the room. Dean watches him walk up the stairs before turning back to painting.
“Well —” Jack starts.
Dean snorts. “And, what? Do you think he
“You’re fine,” Dean says, mostly to comfort this woman that he doesn’t know. He suddenly feels very warm, and all he wants to do is get back to the bunker and drown himself in whiskey. He gets up from the bench and whistles towards Miracle, and she trots over to him. He turns to Mila. “It was nice meeting you.”
“I’m sorry,” Dean mumbles, reaching out to grab Cas’s wrist, pulling him closer. Cas settles between Dean’s legs and loops an arm around his shoulder, threading a hand through the hair at the back of Dean’s neck. Dean drops his head against Cas’s chest. He says, “I can’t do this, Cas.”
“Right.” Dean looks away, takes a step back from Cas, his breath shaking out of him. “Right, of course.” Dean shakes his head, feels his chest constrict. He barks out a strained laugh. “Christ, I’m sorry. I never should have said anything. Just — just forget it, okay?”
“Hey Cas,” He says, out loud, when he’s alone in his room. “I don’t know if you can hear me wherever you are. Well, probably not, but I hope you can. I went through everything we have in the archives, and I can’t find anything to get you out, but I’m not giving up.”
“I do forgive you, Dean.”
“You’re just happy,” Sam says with a shrug. His eyes are twinkling. “So, talk. You’re thinking about popping the question.”
” Cas bites out. If he didn’t know Cas better, Dean would assume he’s angry; but, he does know Cas, and he knows the desperation.
Billie takes a step forward and places a finger on Cas’s forehead. She says, “You now have a human soul, Castiel.”
“Sam, I’m okay,” Dean tells him, and he is. He really is. He smiles when he says, “I don’t get why you would want to go hunting on the road in shitty motels when you could live here, but hey, it’s your choice.”
Because Cas knows him better than anyone else, he smirks slightly, and raises a brow. “Just do it, Dean.”
Billie shrugs. “I suppose Jack can spring you once it takes you, but obviously that would require you to summon it in the first place and I’m guessing that he —” Billie tilts her head towards Dean. “He doesn’t want you to do that.”
Cas looks towards the door before turning back to Dean. “Dean, as happy as I am that he’s gotten his soul back, Billie’s plan seems —”
He strokes a hand down Cas’s back, feeling the evenness of his breathing. Cas lifts his head from where it’s on Dean’s chest, rubs the sleep out of his eyes with the back of his hands, and blinks up at him. “Of course.”
“Are you sure you don’t want to sleep?” Dean asks again, not at all embarrassed that he’s letting a toddler decide for himself. He yawns and tries again. “Please?”
“Moved in about six months ago,” Mila says, tilting her head towards him. She smiles slightly. “After my husband passed away, I needed a change. We used to live in Wichita, and I just kept driving until I ended up here. It’s a nice town.”
“You can’t have ice cream, Jack,” Cas says slowly before doing something that Dean would never, in a million years would expect from him. He pitches his voice slightly higher in what could only be described as
“You’re
Dean sighs. Of course, this isn’t going to be easy. Cas seems to feel the same way because he frowns before he says, “I contacted her and it turns out that she passed it onto the demon, Ruby.”
Dean is leaning against the kitchen island, whiskey glass in hand, when Sam walks in. He immediately frowns and shoots Dean a look when he catches sight of the glass. Dean twitches, fully ready to get defensive over his drinking habits, but Sam doesn’t say anything about it. Instead, he walks over to the fridge and pulls out a half-eaten sandwich. He quietly moves to sit at the table, pulling out his tablet, and wordlessly scrolls through something. Dean thinks that’s it and that Sam would leave well enough alone, but it doesn’t last long, and Sam starts to get twitchy, darting his eyes around the room as he taps his fingers on the table.
“I’m sorry I didn’t stop by earlier,” Jack says into his shoulder. Dean helps him stand, and it takes a moment for Jack’s powers to flicker back in, and his eyes glow bright before settling into a familiar blue. Jack says, “I heard your prayers, but it wasn’t the right time for me to come to Earth.”
“Yeah, you’re right, buddy,” Dean tells him. He picks up a navy hoodie instead and shows it to Jack. “How about this?”
“Did you now?” Dean asks, completely unable to keep his own pride at bay.
“Jimmy Novak’s birthday is the 10th of July,” Cas suggests, not bothering to question why they’re looking for a birthday for him.
"Right," Cas says cooly, not looking at Dean. He moves towards the discarded jar of paint, picks it up, and hands it over to Dean. "If you want to stay, then start painting the warding."
“Alright, show off,” Dean mutters.
Jack squats down to the floor, dropping the ingredients into the cauldron. He looks between Sam and Dean as he explains, “Basically, we’re opening a rift into The Empty. When Nick did the ritual, he was trying to draw Lucifer to him, and he would act as the vessel for Lucifer. However, in our case, Dean is going to enter The Empty, and pull Cas out, and I’ll be able to recreate Cas’s vessel, as well as close the rift. With any luck, I might be able to put it back to sleep.”
“Well, that’s as much a reason as any for me to want Chuck dead,” Billie says with a hint of a smile. “Maybe after this is all over, you boys will make my life a lot easier.” She pauses and looks at them. “I can’t make any promises, but I will reach out to you if there is an alternate way, but if there isn’t —”
“He died,” Jack mumbles, opening the back seat and slamming it behind him, not saying another word.
“I like the first one,” Cas says firmly, like it’s a carefully researched decision.
“We’re people who want to talk about buying the house,” Cas says, pointedly. Dean snickers, but immediately shuts up when Cas gives him a look. Keeping his voice level and entirely too professional for an ex-Angel with very few people skills, he says, “Ms. Blake, if you could show me the garden while my husband and son find this ghost, that would be great.”
“I’m fine. The case just took a bit out of me and I need rest,” Cas says, not quite looking at Dean. Without another word, he walks out of the room.
Jack’s face closes off immediately. His eyes dart around for a moment before settling on Dean’s face. He explains, “Well, I knew Chuck could resurrect angels from The Empty and I knew I was able to do that before I absorbed his power, so as soon as I saw that you were struggling, I tried pulling Castiel out.”
“My dad was a dick,” Dean points out, finding that he doesn’t feel all that guilty describing his father in those terms anymore. Still, yeah, Jack might be four, but Dean can’t exactly follow him around like an overprotective father. He wrinkles his nose and gives Cas a once over. “Well, get cleaned up then. I’ll get dinner going.”
Dean hangs up and tries again.
Jack blinks, still staring at his hands. He shakes his head and smiles at them. “That was really weird.”
Lebanon is a town with a population of two hundred and eighteen people, which doesn’t include anyone living in the bunker on the rural road on the outskirts of town. There’s exactly one non denominational chapel that brags about being the geographic center of the contiguous United States, but the actual center is a tiny monument at a nearby park. Nobody actually visits Lebanon, so it’s very easy to know who everybody is, and everybody notices the weirdos living in the abandoned factory on the rural road that isn’t actually a part of the town.
he thinks, but each breath he takes feels choppier than the last, and Dean curls into himself, bringing his knees up towards his chest and wrapping his arms around them. He can’t stop surrendering to the grief that swells through him like lava threatening to erupt at any point. He doesn’t know when the tears start falling, but once they start, they don’t stop, not until his eyes burn and the front of his t-shirt is drenched.
Cas’s voice quivers slightly when he says, “Of course, I’ll marry you, Dean.”
“Of course,” Cas promises.
“Dean,” Sam starts again.
“I’m sorry,” Dean says. He doesn’t know what he’s apologizing for. “For what it’s worth, I’m glad you never gave up on me.”
“I love you too,” Cas says, closing his eyes, and loops his arms around Dean’s neck.
He holds his arms out, and they have no choice, but to let him hug them. It’s secretly very, very nice. When they pull away, Dean says, “Well, lets see the rings then.”
“I made a deal. In return for complete silence, I would get Jack,” Billie explains. “The Empty has as much a reason to see God fall as the rest of us.”
“Hey,” Dean says, reaching a hand out to poke Cas’s sides. He lets out a low whine, pulling the sheets up higher. Dean laughs. “I thought you didn’t need to sleep.”
Jack immediately perks up, reaching a chubby hand towards the hoodie. “I want!”
“That’s nice,” Dean mutters, tossing the potatoes into the broth. He ignores the bitterness creeping into him. It’s not that he’s not happy for Sam, of course, he is. It’s just that he doesn’t want to consider what his own happiness looks like. When Sam doesn’t say anything else, Dean adds, “I’m happy for you, man.”
He spots Cas’s truck parked on the gravel path leading to the cabin as they make their way off the trail. Dean moves to unlock the door, turning the light on in the entryway. The first thing he sees is Cas’s discarded blade and wallet on the kitchen table before he sees Cas on the couch. He’s on his back, an arm thrown over his face, with his eyes closed. The trench coat is discarded on the floor and his tie is undone.
“Rowena?”
“Can I ask what happened?” Jack asks, not bothering to be delicate about it.
“Talk about what?”
“It doesn’t make it easier,” Jack says, eyeing Dean carefully. “You know that.”
Dean feels like he’s floating on air when he sees Jack kick a soccer ball, dribbling past two players before he puts the ball in the top corner of the net. He turns towards Dean, waving in pure joy. Dean raises his hand to wave back when Jack’s eyes glow bright yellow, the skin on his face cracking.
“I’ll take that as a win,” Dean admits, voice cracking slightly.
Dean tries rattling his brain for any stories he knows, and finds that he can’t come up with anything. He doesn’t have to though because Cas has him covered.
With less than ten minutes left, Rowena walks down the stairs of the bunker, smiling coyly at them all.
“I am,” Cas confirms. He tilts his head towards Dean. “The thing I still don’t understand about being human is how I could be so profoundly happy, but still feel sadness at certain things.”
Cas doesn’t look up from his newspaper. “Good morning, Dean.”
Sam immediately closes his mouth and nods slowly, an unspoken understanding passing between them that Dean is grateful for. Sam nods twice; the concern palpable on his face, and Dean can see the emotions flickering behind his eyes. He says, “We could try and get him back.”
Dean controls the trembling in his hands to hunch down and lift Jack off the ground. Sam is instantly by his side as they manage to get Jack to a bed. Rowena instantly pulls out a spellbook to get to work.
"Maybe you're not saying the right thing," Sam suggests.
Sam just stares him down and Dean lets out a frustrated groan.
Dean rolls his eyes. “Come here.” He pulls Sam into a tight hug. “See you soon.”
It shouldn’t be easy to avoid people in a cabin as small as Cas’s is, but that’s what happens. Dean doesn’t get any sleep the first night, so he finds himself up early. He walks down the path from the cabin to the grocery store. He picks up eggs and bacon, tries cooking, and hopes the smell would draw Cas and Jack out of their respective rooms. It doesn’t quite work, and Dean heads back into the living room and pulls out his laptop to work. The second day is a little better because Jack comes downstairs in his pajamas. His hair is unruly, and he looks terrible.
“He didn’t always,” Dean admits. Cas tips his head to the side and squints his eyes. Dean feels Cas trying to study him, and he figures he might as well pull that particular band-aid off. He clears his throat. “When you - uh, well. When Jack was born and you - well, you know. I wasn’t great with him because I was scared, and he wasn’t like anything I expected or understood.”
Dean looks at Sam who nods. Dean says, “That sounds fair.”
“Hey,” Dean says, softly as to not startle Cas.
“It’s complicated.”
“You are,” Cas confirms earnestly. “I think you’re doing well, and I think you’ll do better eventually. You clearly care very deeply for him, Dean, and it shows in everything you do.”
Dean lets out a low chuckle at that. "Probably better than what he's been eating." Cas hums in agreement but doesn't say anything else. The silence between them feels strange. It's not like Cas is much of a talker under normal circumstances, but the strain is unbearable right now.  Quietly, Dean says, "You know I miss him too, right?"
He pulls Cas a little closer, and Cas steps into his space and blinks up. He reaches a finger up to trace a finger over where his grace is hanging around Dean’s neck and smiles. He drops his hand and slides his arm around Dean's waist, up the back of Dean’s flannel. It’s a simple gesture, but Cas’s presence grounds Dean to Earth, to this new Earth, where God is on their side and they’re all safe.
“I am,” Cas agrees, but he’s smiling softly at Jack. Cas tilts his head towards Jack. “Jack, on the other hand, could be a world champion.”
When Dean knocks on the door, there’s no reply on the other end; Dean waits a moment before turning the handle to find Jack sitting cross-legged on his bed as he stares at the wall, completely zoned out. “Jack.”
Dean barely gets to the door before he hears her; he turns his head and spots Amara as he stands under a street lamp across the street, with a disbelieving look on her face. Her eyes are wide, and they turn wary as Dean makes his way across the street.
“Or, Cas escaping,” Dean fills in the blanks. They’ve pissed off every cosmic entity out there at some point. It’s really no surprise that they’re not all that willing to work them anymore. Dean runs a hand over his face and asks, “So, it’s hopeless then.”
There’s also no jobs in Lebanon, which Dean realizes several job searches in. He also realizes that he actually has no marketable skills and next to no references, and there’s only so far a GED and a give ‘em hell attitude can carry a person. The one garage in town is owned by a man named Rudy Schmidt; he’s a man in his fifties with broad shoulders, neatly trimmed beard, and a vocabulary that extends to a few grunts and an occasional huff. Dean doesn’t know why Rudy decides to offer him the job, but he suspects it has more to do with Baby than himself, but still, he can fix a car and Rudy is more than a generous boss.
“I’ll pass.”
A ghost of a smile flickers over Jack’s face. “Like love.”
“Next time, you ask for help,” Dean points out from his spot on the floor. Jack just nods, expression blank. Once Dean finishes up, he asks, “So, now what?”
Cas frowns. “Jack was able to pull me out.”
Dean looks away. “Felt like me.”
. He groans, “I feel like a teenager right now.”
Anger flares in Dean before he can control it. It’s not that he blames the kid, but he’s had a lifetime of goodbyes and he’s not sure he could handle another one. Thankfully, Sam is there and he reaches out to place a hand on Jack’s shoulder.
Cas kisses him, first softly, and then properly, and Dean sighs into it. He shifts, pulling Cas closer still so that he’s half on top of Dean. He touches his tongue to Cas’s bottom lip and Cas hums into it, and opens up to let him in. Dean rolls back onto the bed and pulls Cas on top of him. Cas holds his face as he nudges at his jaw. Dean tilts his head, a soft noise breaking out of his throat at the feel of  Cas pressing an open-mouthed kiss to his neck.
Dean nods. “I need to know about The Empty.”
? How could you — fuck, how could you just leave
“How are you feeling?” Cas asks hesitantly.
Dean looks around to place it, but he can’t find Cas anywhere. Dean tries shouting, but it comes out as a muffled sound that gets lost in the void. All the sensations filter out and Dean feels like he’s running on air and going nowhere.
"Well, at least we got Jack back. I don't know if we can trust Billie, but if this works, we might finally be free," Sam says with a shake of the head.
“Yes, but -”
Dean still doesn’t like it, but he nods.
“No, you aren’t,” Cas deadpans. Dean bristles with swift offense, but there’s no heat in it because Cas smiles, cocking his head to the side. When Dean scoffs, Cas schools his face into the picture of innocence. He blinks up at Dean and asks, “Coffee?”
When Dean lifts his head to look at Cas, he can tell that Cas is still angry, but there’s something else behind the blues of his eyes. Dean isn't delusional enough to think that everything is water under the bridge just because they're in the same room again, but they both want to save Jack, and that might be enough for now.
“Thank you,” Dean tells him when he manages to catch his breath.
“Oh,” Jack says slowly. He’s still staring at Dean, and it’s disconcerting in a way that’s so reminiscent of Cas. After a moment, Jack shrugs. “Well, you should get married.”
Sam rolls his eyes, probably agitated that Dean didn’t listen to his research, but Cas just looks at him fondly, the corners of his mouth curving up into a small smile; he doesn’t say anything though, and it’s Sam who breaks the silence between them.
It’s Cas who breaks the ice. His voice quivers slightly when he says, “Dean, I’m sorry.”
It was Jack’s idea to start a fire in the backyard. He wants to go camping, and while none of them were willing to set up a tent, this seemed like an easy enough compromise. Dean grilled dinner with Eileen’s help, and Sam and Cas started the fire.
“Stay safe,” Cas tells him, taking a step back. Dean just blinks at him, probably for a fraction too long because Cas chuckles. “Dean, I’m currently in the process of dealing with losing my grace for good while we’re all on a nigh-impossible mission to defeat God. I’m
When Cas looks at him, Dean can feel the warmth and appreciation radiating off him and Dean’s heart clinches. He just wishes — no, he can’t go there, not now. Instead, he tries smiling, even if he knows that Cas can see right through it. “He's a lot more like me than I realized.”
like an idiot. He debates calling Sam about it, but decides that his little brother getting involved in his personal crisis is the last thing he wants to do, so he just waits. He just doesn’t know what he’s waiting for.
Cas opens his mouth to say something, but immediately closes it when someone clears their throat. Dean throws his head back to look at the ceiling, letting out a quiet, but exasperated, sigh. Cas wordlessly steps back, and Dean looks over his shoulder to where Eileen is standing by the door. She smirks at them, running a hand through her sleep-tousled hair.
Dean hisses a breath and tries to focus, the doubt beginning to creep in his mind. He wonders how his life ended up here. Long gone are the days when his biggest worry was whether he can kill a demon or not. Rage flows through him like lava; this is all Chuck’s fault, it has to be. Chuck designed the universe; he designed the game that they’re all playing. It’s his fucking fault that Jack might die; that Cas will be taken by The Empty. Dean feels lost in the vortex of anger swirling in him, and he slams the books off his bed, the papers flying in every direction.
Dean feels a chill run down his spine. How many worlds has Chuck destroyed? The countless lives that he killed; the lives that he ruined for no other reason than for his own, twisted amusement. It’s all a game that they were never fair players in. The idea fills Dean with cold, unfiltered rage. Chuck has to die, there are no two ways around it, and they have to do everything they can to make sure that’s the endgame. No matter what it takes.
Amara raises a brow. “Well, it’s a vast nothingness that existed before my brother and I came into being, and it will exist long after both of us have been destroyed.”
“We have to try,” Sam insists.
Dean plays The Rain Song for Cas one night when they’re alone in the bunker. He lets the low guitars and the steady drums wash over him as he considers the words. He has a weird relationship with music in general; oftentimes, it was a way to impress a father who never seemed to be impressed, and sometimes it was for himself to communicate something he didn’t know how to communicate.
Dean blinks. “We will?”
Sam and Dean exchange a look. Dean says, “That’s okay with me. I have to try, man.”
Cas blinks in confusion. “My grace?”
Dean doesn’t know what to say to that. Instantly, he remembers Hell and how the physical pain was bad, but it’s the emotional torture that tormented him the most. Their lives are just one regret after another. He asks, “I can understand demons dreaming about their regrets, but what about the normal angels? You know, the ones that never came to Earth and never really did anything out of the ordinary. What would they dream about?”
“Play stupid games and win stupid prizes,” Billie says with a shrug. “All of you mess with the rules of the living and the dead so often that you’ve pissed off pretty much every cosmic entity out there.”
“I thought I had — something with Cas, but I was wrong,” Dean says hesitantly. He runs a hand over his face. This is
That's the million-dollar question, and Dean doesn't know the answer. He doesn't know where to even start. Even at the best of times, Cas is flighty — desperate to stake his life on a new crusade, but this time, it's different. Cas didn't go somewhere to do something; Cas walked out on them, on
"Hey," Dean says, voice still rough from sleep. Cas immediately flinches before turning around to face him; he leans against the counter, wrapping his hands tightly around his coffee mug. Dean already knows that he's facing an uphill battle when he sees Cas’s face and it’s as blank as ever, clearly not in the mood to see Dean, let alone talk to him. Cas slants his head to the side but doesn't say anything.
After a moment, Jack - their normal, late teenage but still actually two year old, Jack - stares at them. He alternates between looking at his own body and all their faces.
Dean notices Claire’s car pull up into the driveway of Donna’s cabin, so he walks out to greet her. It’s a brisk evening and his socked feet are cold against the porch. He raises a hand in greeting as soon as she gets out. Claire pulls her backpack out of the back seat and throws it over her shoulder.
“I love you,” Dean says again, enjoying the way the words sound on his tongue. Cas smiles at him softly. Dean points between them. “If we do this, it’s for real. I can’t lose you again. So, please stay forever, or as long as our human lives let us, because this is it for me, Cas.”
Cas gives him a look. “You would hate it if your father followed you around.”
“Cute,” Claire tells them. “But, please for the love of God —”
Dean tries focusing on the mission, on Jack, on anything that isn't Cas, but he can't. They've been broken for years now, either running away from each other or pushing each other away; Chuck might have hit the final nail in the coffin when he killed Jack, but Dean knows he built the coffin to bury Cas in long before he even knew about Chuck's manipulations. His anger and his pride caught up to them, and Cas walked away, and Dean isn’t sure that he’s ever coming back.
"Right," Dean says absentmindedly. At least until Cas's statement hits him, and a sudden fear loops around in his gut. "You hunted a djinn here?"
“I do,” Dean says swiftly with no hesitation at all. “If there’s one thing I know I want to do, it’s that.”
. If you’d have told him that they would involve a devastating hangover followed by Cas asking him to accompany him on a routine trip to the farmers’ market, well, he would have laughed and then pined over that thought for ages.
“Cas?”
look of all time.
he thinks. They’re so close. Something softens in Rowena and her mouth curves down. Quietly, she says, “The final ingredient for the spell is the grace of a nephilim’s father, and unfortunately, we don’t have that. As much as I love all of you, I don’t feel comfortable bringing Lucifer back to life.”
“Jack!” Dean shouts, rushing to his side with Cas right beside him a moment later. He reaches two fingers out to check for Jack’s pulse and realizes he’s breathing. Dean exhales sharply and looks around him.
“Jack?” Cas asks, voice laced with worry. He looks at Billie. “Is he —”
“Obviously,” Cas says, casually. Dean tries really hard not to preen at that.
Jack gives him a look, very clearly not buying that, which Dean supposes is fair because he has no fucking clue how they’re going to do that, but there’s a lightness between them now. Dean watches fondly as Jack picks up another cookie, biting into it with a smile. Dean stares at him for too long, he knows, but it’s been a long time since he’s had a chance to do this with Jack. It’s always been one of Dean’s favorite things; he would sneak Jack out on a hunt and they would come back to the bunker and eat sugary cereal. Sam would hate it because, of course, Sam would hate it, but Cas would catch them and smile that half-smile of his before joining them quietly. Dean picks up a cookie, smiling wistfully at the memory.
When Sam had come to him to discuss the possibility of moving out, Dean told him that they all had true free will now and that Sam can do what he wants. Dean admits that it was probably a little snide at the time because it’s hard to break away from more than two decades of indoctrination at the hands of his father, but now, looking at the boxes, Dean thinks he’s okay with it. There’s always a time for the kids to move out because that’s who Sam is -- Sam is his brother, but he’s also his baby brother, and in his own way, a son.
Forty five.
Eileen cautiously pokes her head through the door; the light from the hallway is too bright and it instantly hurts Dean’s eyes, but then Eileen turns the lights in his room on, and Dean feels his head split from the sensory change. She steps fully into the room, laptop in hand.
“Are you sure you don’t want to come along?”
“January 24th,” Dean says automatically.
He looks at Cas again. It’s probably just a salt and burn, and it’s on the way back to the bunker, and it’s not like they have anywhere pressing they need to be. He has a lot of sympathy for Jack’s boredom too. He shrugs, smiling slightly. “What the hell — we’re due a family hunting trip, anyways.”
thought away because that’s not what this situation is.
"That's nice," Cas says, a ghost of a smile flickers over his face. It quickly drops though, and Cas's face settles back into the same blank apathy. Dean doesn't know why he expects something else from Cas when the last time they were in the same room together, Cas had walked away and Dean had to grapple with the end of their already fractured friendship. It's like his memories fade into reality because Cas turns away from him and walks towards the stairs. Without looking at Dean, he says, "Tell Sam to reach out to me when he gets back."
. Christ, Dean really thought this would all be over once they got through Chuck’s last apocalypse, but it’s never over. He’ll be back, and he’ll want his revenge, and Dean knows that there’s going to be death and pain at the end of it all. But the worst part is that the world might be ending and yet, all Dean can think about is the way Cas turned his back away from Dean as he walked up those stairs.
He blinks up at Cas. His voice is rough when he says, “Mornin’, sunshine.”
“I’m going to die,” Jack tells them quietly. There’s a slight tremble to his voice when he continues, “The last quest for Billie’s plan will turn me into a bomb, and when the time comes, it will take Chuck out — and, it will kill me as well.”
Dean closes his eyes, trying to keep his memories from catching up to him again, but Cas places a light hand on his back, and Dean can feel the tension leave his body. He’s surprised how strong his voice sounds when he says, “It wasn’t all your fault. I knew he wasn't well, and I tried hard to ignore it too. Besides, we never would have been in that position if Chuck hadn’t played us.”
“Dean, come on,” Sam exasperates, throwing his hands up. “You’ve barely left your room in weeks.”
"I know," Jack tells him. "I'll keep you posted."
“Then, okay,” Billie says with a nod. “I’ll contact you when I have information.”
. He’s said it before, but right then, with Cas hunched over, beyond defeated, Dean knows that’s not enough.
Cas smirks and Dean thinks that it’s
Cas pushes himself off the counter and settles down on one of the bar stools. He opens a newspaper, pulling out a pen from his pocket, and gets to work on the daily crossword puzzle. Dean makes his way to the coffee machine, pulling open one of the cupboards above to get a cup, and silently pours himself coffee. He eyes Cas furtively, but Cas pretty much ignores him, focusing on his puzzle instead. The early morning sunlight is drifting through the window above the sink, so Dean pulls apart the blinds to let the sunlight in.
Jack studies Dean carefully before nodding. “Okay, Dean.”
Dean hesitates outside Cas’s room; he’s been avoiding Cas for days, and now that he needs to face him, Dean feels lightheaded and he just wants to walk back to his room and curl up in his blankets until a new, hopefully, better day. But, he saw the devastation on Cas’s face and Cas has been with him through every tragedy in his life for so long that Dean can suck up his pathetic, midlife
“He’ll live,” Billie confirms. She hunches down to run a hand over Jack’s chest. “We would need to watch over him, but he should come back into consciousness in a couple of hours.”
“Does it ever get easier?” Dean asks, before he could stop himself.
“I won seven games in a row,” Jack chimes, looking incredibly proud of himself.
Dean's brows draw together in confusion. "And you think she's right?"
Cas stares at him, tilting his head to the side. He places a hand on Dean’s shoulder. “We’ve all tried to kill each other at some point.”
Dean is brought out of his thoughts by Cas sliding up to him. “Hey.”
per se, but I suppose — well, I suppose I would rule as Death. The natural order is what it is now, and when people die, they will be weighed against the abacus, and those souls that belong in Heaven will go to Heaven.” She gives Dean a
Between Claire and Jack, they settle on some Disney fare, and Dean knows he should probably protest just for old time’s sake, but really, who’s going to say no to Elsa from Frozen anyways? It doesn’t really matter though because Cas is carding his fingers through Dean’s hair, and it takes all of Dean’s strength to keep from falling asleep right there and then. About half way through, Dean gives up and drops his head to Cas’s lap, curling his legs into himself.
Dean decides to start with Jack.
“Google,” Cas says, standing up and eyeing the toilet proudly. Cas flushes it once and tilts his head to shoot a crooked grin in Dean’s direction. “It’s not, as you would say, rocket science.”
Cas tilts his head to the side, blinking his eyes up at Dean. There’s still tired lines around his eyes, and there’s a gray hair or two, but he looks
“So, we get Amara in on this, and then what?” Sam asks.
?” Sam practically squeaks. He narrows his eyes. “When?”
Sam suggests that they split up. Cas takes Jack to figure out the missing children situation, Sam goes with Eileen to sort out the demigod, and Dean — well, if there’s one thing Dean still knows about his life, it’s that he’s pretty damn good at killing vampires.
“Absolutely not.” Dean shudders at the thought. “That’s just a recipe for disaster.”
“Getting Castiel back.”
Cas waits until the front door shuts behind Jack before he says, “We are not following him.”
Dean watches Cas stare at Jack like that’s the most interesting fact he’s ever heard, and Jack for his part blinks back at Cas, babbling something nonsensical. Cas laughs, low and utterly happy, and instantly Dean feels a pull in his heart.
Dean opens his mouth to say something when Cas runs his fingers through Dean’s hair and says, “Not Lord of the Rings either. We watched the extended edition at least five times.”
“Maybe,” Dean concedes because there’s very little he wants in this world more than Chuck dead. When Jack opens his mouth to say something else, Dean raises a finger.  “But, I don’t like it and neither do Cas and Sam.”
Sam gives them one last look before he packs his gear bag and leaves the bunker. Dean waits until the door closes before he picks Jack up and turns to Cas. He flashes a crooked grin and says, “We should go shopping.”
The smile that Cas gives him is so unreservedly fond that Dean feels his heart flutter. He should be used to it by now, but he’s really not, and he doesn’t think he’ll ever be used to being in love and being loved.
Billie shakes her head. “Theoretically, he should be fine. I’m sure that there could be some physical side effects for a while, but nothing that would leave long term damage.”
Dean laughs. “Yeah, we can make that happen.”
Dean half expects Cas to be at the bunker when they get back; that he could walk through the empty halls and hear Cas’s low voice calling his name out once again. The world is right again; their friends are back, the birds are chirping, and Miracle is a living, breathing dog. With a flick of a finger, Jack was able to put everything back in its right place, like nothing was ever amiss, except —
He pulled up into the hospital parking lot, glancing at his watch. 10:20 am, New York traffic could suck it. He all but ran through the front door, where Eileen was waiting for him, furious. She was a surgeon who saved lives, she was engaged to Sammy, she couldn’t kill him right? ….right? The look on her face suggested otherwise.
“God so excited to get ready for him ARENT you?! Use prote-“
Cas: yes. I mean, I did ask you didn’t I?
“No way. you’re a stalker I’m sure of it. Because I’m from Lawrence too!!”
And then he saw him.
Stopping right outside the door, he took out a scrap of paper with castiels number on it that he had handed him. while saving the name-
It was Dean’s turn to be indignant. “Wh- excuse me I was not!”
“Its nice to meet you Dean, I’ve heard a lot about you” Cas managed to say with a small smile.
“I can’t believe this. All these years of friendship and you’ve only been plotting to get me a boyfriend.”
“GOD YOU'RE SO GONE ON HIM ALREADY I LOVE IT HERE.”
Castiel was kind of a mouthful. He was gonna call him Cas.
5:58 pm
“You act as if you’re not completely smitten. Wear the maroon v necked sweater over a checkered shirt with black pants.”
“I didn’t even do anything.” He muttered as he left the auditorium.
“This place called Passage Du Grand Cerf.”
“Shut up Dean. Oh and before I forget-“
“Ah. I see” she smiled. “well, go on then I won’t keep you any longer.”
“WHO CALLS THEIR BEST FRIEND ONLY ONCE A WEEK”
He had only met him an hour ago but something about him felt familiar, felt right.
Dean nodded as he headed to take a seat somewhere near the middle of the auditorium. Jody Mills was his film teacher, and probably the only reason he wasn’t bored out of his mind. She treated him like a son, and he saw her as a mother figure. She always made her classes so interactive, engaging and interesting that dean couldn’t help but focus.
Whatever Dean expected, this was not it. Castiel wanted to see him again? Or was he just getting ahead of himself? He hoped to god it was the former.
“BYE CHARLIE.” He cut the call to the sound of her laughter.
Ah, fuck it. Might as well just call him over.
“What can I say, romance isn’t dead. I’ll see you later?”
Cas: cas?
Dean knocked on the door labelled ‘professor Jody Mills.’
John died a few years ago in a car crash, and the multimillion dollar company fell into Deans hands. Dean was never interested in a boring life spent at board meetings and bossing other people around. He loved adventure and found climbing mountains his calling. However, Sammy was a lawyer at Hanscum-Mills, one of the most renowned firms in East America, and Adam was too young to handle the whole company on his own, so Dean signed on as CEO, sharing the workload with Adam, but Adam was more suited for the job. He always had a charm that made people like him instantly, and was the public face of the company, handling press conferences and well, mostly everything while Dean took a backseat and only interfered in major issues and was always there when Adam or anyone else needed his help. He was proud of Adam and Sammy. Proud of what fine young med they’d grown up to be. If Kate and Mary were around to see them, they would be just as proud as Dean. Sammy was rising through the ranks at the company and was set to be the youngest managing partner the firm had ever seen, and Adam was a boss at handling all the complexities the family business demanded. This more or less left Dean to do the one thing he really wanted to, climb.
He rummaged through his bag and brought out a piece of paper and a pen. After scribbling something on it, he handed it to Dean.
“Yes then. Yes. A million times yes.”
Cas’ face lit up. He seemed to glow in the evening light
Charlie: https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcRoXX8-jvjay7TWRk_AhoNOvyNzN8n49pFgWA&usqp=CAU
Dean nudged Benny and shot him a smirk. Benny replied by punching Deans arm.
Castiel was laughing again, and so was Dean.
She wasn’t wrong.
“Okay, I and Bela will wait.”
“... and I hope that solves it.”
Cas: shut up dean
“What is up my dude?!”
Dean paused for a second, a dumbfounded look on his face.
“It’s a talent, and you’re not that hard to read.”
Dean: I mean I’ve passed it a few times but I’ve never really gone in
“Hello to you too Charlie, I’m fine by the way thanks for asking.”
“Dean, meet Cas.” “Cas, meet Dean.” Eileen said, the both of them still looking at each other.
“Oh so you were checking me out just now weren’t you?”
Cas: see, I don’t know I mean I only just met you
“CHARLIE.”
A few mumbled yes’ came from the audience.
dean smacked his arm but didn’t say anything as professor mills was approaching the dais, about to start class.
God. He was attractive and had good taste? The gods really were shining upon Dean today.
“I’m Castiel Novak, professional coffee drinker” came the reply, with another smile.
“YOU NEVER CALL YOU NEVER TEXT I'M KINDA IN SHOCK HERE”
Dean was glad he’d found this place. It wasn’t too fancy, but it reminded him of home and oh, how he missed home. Sammy, Ellen, Jo, Bobby, Charlie and even Anael. He didn’t have a lot of time to think about them though, most of his time was spent on his projects for the University. Not that he was complaining. A 75% scholarship to the University of Paris where he could study films and filmmaking? It wasn’t something he would pass up easily. At first he’d been a bit reluctant to leave Sammy, but Ellen and Bobby more than assured him that he’d be well looked after, to quote Bobby “the kid’s gonna be fine dean, now you get your ass to Paris and you make us proud.” Dean trusted Ellen and Bobby more than himself, so he knew Sam would be just fine. And anyway, it’s not like Sam would just let him not go.
“YOU'RE THE ONE WHO BURNT YOUR TONGUE AND HE SAW AND NOW YALL ARE GOING ON A DATE. NOW YOU BLAME ME?”
“You too” Dean said, and smiled, squeezing Cas’ hand once, he let go.
“THAT'S NOT TRUE I CALLED YOU LAST WEEK”
Cas: we’re on for 6:30 then?
I hope you liked it, chapter 3 should be up in less than a week :)
“Every stalker says that, but I believe you. You’re also right with regards to everything you said.”
Eileen’s smile lit up her face. “Thank you Cas. He’s awesome, you’re gonna love him!” she said before taking her leave.
“He’s good, and he’s doing pretty well at the firm.” Eileen said proudly. “Anyway, I just wanted to give you a heads up, Adam Winchester won’t be coming here today. He’s busy with a last minute press conference, and he’s really sorry to miss it.”
“Where have you been all my life? it’s the most underrated show I’ve ever come across, it deserves everything.” Replied Dean, equalling the excitement.
“Ça va bien Elise, merci!”
“Desolé professor, won’t happen again.” Bela replied, a sheepish look on her face.
He plopped down on his couch, a coffee in his hand. This time he blew in it a few times before he took a sip.
From a very young age, he always wanted to tell stories, real stories and what better way to tell stories, than through visuals?
“DEAN WINCHESTER WHERE HAVE YOU BEEN”
Now, nine years and multiple awards later, here he was. Chief of neurosurgery at the best hospital in the state – if not the whole country – just hours away from signing his name on a piece of paper approving a drug that would save hundreds of lives here, and millions around the world. Lives that would have otherwise been lost.
“Yes, I know how to drink coffee,” Dean grumbled .
“Let’s do it.”
endeared.
Dean: you’ll have to wait and find out :)
“It’s not that funny” he grumbled
Finally, after what seemed like a decade, classes were finished for the day. So funny, how the day was a blur but also seemed to drag on forever.
Dean: The whole point of me taking film Sam, was not studying. Now, why are you up so late?
Cas’ face fell. “So does that mean, no signing?’ he asked dejectedly.
“Sure, professor Mills. I haven’t done anything wrong though have I?”
In his periphery, he saw a man walk in and talk to Eileen. That must be Dean. A few seconds later, Eileen turned back and beckoned Cas forward. He could feel Deans eyes on him as as he walked forward. Just as he reached them, he snapped his head up.
“Here’s your coffee Dean” came a voice, interrupting his thoughts.
More than a teacher, she was Deans mentor. All the projects Dean thought were trash, she thought were beautiful, and slowly dean started to see the beauty in them too.
Stay calm you can freak out later stay calm you can freak out later stay calm you can freak out later went deans internal monologue
“DEAN.”
Castiel smiled at him again, this time a genuine one as he picked up his sandwich and coffee. He picked put his bag by its strap and then walked over to where Dean was sat. He slung the bag over the chair and set down his breakfast. Then he sat down himself.
Charlie: GO GET HIM!!!!!!!
“Just gave you the answer to your doubt last class, Mr Winchester. Did you get that down or do you want me to repeat it?”
Dean: you’re breaking my heart here cas:(
Dean: It suits you better than Castiel. I’ll stop if you don’t like it
He walked into the hospital and headed up to the attendings lounge to grab a cup of coffee and a croissant before he made his way to his office. On his way, he bumped into Eileen.
“He/they. This is ideally what our first interaction should’ve been, you know.” Castiel said with a laugh.
“Right, so you must be wondering why I’m telling you about it, I’ll get straight to the point.”
He took a seat near the window which gave him a view of the street as well as the beautiful morning sky above the quaint buildings.
Something caught his eye and he whipped out his phone to take a quick photo of a shaggy cat stretched out lazily across a car.
Sam replied instantly, it was 1 am there what the hell was he doing up?!
Dean jerked back to reality when Benny nudged him and very smugly said
“Yeah but, Brooklyn nine-nine and the office are at the same level.”
6:17 pm
“You haven’t Dean, don’t worry. Please do see me though, it’s really important.”
Taylor Swift’s voice slowly trickled through the radio, and Cas smiled, increasing the volume. He hadn’t heard this one since 2008. The smile on his face grew bigger as he tapped his foot to the beat. It was beautiful to rediscover old songs.
He put his phone down and reached to take out his laptop. While he waited for his regular order of coffee and a butter croissant and for his file to open, his mind wandered back to Kansas again.
Dean: Hey, is this my stalker?
She nodded once and carried on, and dean went straight back to his phone.
On his way out of the Winchester manor, he grabbed a cup of coffee and a banana. He left as quick as he could, knowing that if Adam saw him leaving so late, he would tear him a new one. Smiling at the hilarious image of Adams face getting all red, he got into the car. As he drove toward the New York mercy hospital (NYMH), an unsettling feeling washed over him. It wasn’t a bad feeling, just strange and unfamiliar. He felt like something was about to change, something big, and the universe was holding its breath in anticipation. He almost laughed at that, it seemed very silly and as the feeling slowly dissipated, he felt his mind drift onto bigger things.
“Shoot.”
“I’m in undergrad year 3- film and filmmaking at the University of Paris”
“Yes” eileen said, smiling fondly. “He practically raised Sam, and when their father remarried, he raised Adam too.”
“Ok Mr smart, now if you’re done deviating, CAN WE GET BACK TO YOUR DATE?!”
Cas: how can you live in Paris and not go to passage du grand Cerf?!
His face broke into a smile as bright as stars on the water.
“Morning? You just woke up didn’t you?” she asked accusingly. “You were supposed to be here an hour ago!”
“Dean, I appreciate your enthusiasm, but you need to eat. So go, and we’ll talk about this soon.”
8 am, a lovely Paris morning. The streets were full of bustling people heading to work and school, and if you looked closely you’d see a few people with bewildered and confused expressions walking around looking at everything in awe. Tourists. Dean loved them. They reminded him of himself, when not too long ago, he was wandering the streets of Paris, taking it all in.
“So, what and where do you study?”
“How do you feel about being the assistant director?”
He was hungry, but in his hurry to leave and the general excitement that hung in the air, he’d forgotten to eat. Shrugging, he got into his car. He’d just grab a bite at the hospital. His watch read 8:15am and he desperately hoped he wouldnt be greeted by traffic on the way. Naturally, the traffic was worse than it usually was. Cas was annoyed. And bored out of his mind. Keeping one hand on the wheel, he decided to put the radio on. He very rarely played music while he drove ( because he had seen firsthand what accidents that could cause) but since, by the looks of it, he was going to be stuck here for a while, why not?
Cas: the stalker joke is getting old. Tell me you at least have one other?
“I know you won’t, that’s why I chose you.”
He got up and walked to the door, brimming with happiness.
Fuck. If anyone could make head or tails of how Dean was feeling, it was Charlie.
“Shit did I not tell you? His name is Castiel Novak. And wait for it.. he’s from Lawrence too.”
“Hello Dean. You’re early.”
If 6:30 didn’t roll around soon, Dean was sure he’d go insane.
“Okay no what are you wearing”
Today was different though. He was headed to NYMH to sign off on a 5 million dollar neural drug deal. Neuraforte, the groundbreaking drug Winchester Pharma had come out with had the potential to help millions of patients around the world. He was filling in for Adam, who was occupied with a last moment press conference, and he was also going to be visiting the hospital very frequently over the next few weeks, to view the results of their drug firsthand.  Eileen Leahy, cardiothoracic surgeon extraordinaire and also chief of surgery at NYMH, had approached Dean directly about the drug as soon as he had told her about it, and New York mercy was going to be one of the first hospitals in the world to start using it.
Cas: so you’re already planning a second date huh
“I’m Dean Winchester. Professional coffee spiller”
While walking into class, which by some miracle he wasn’t late to, he made a decision.
Ugh. So he was going to be difficult. No problem, it’s an area dean excelled in.
“Merci!” he smiled at her.
He took a sip of his coffee instantly. Now he was no more an idiot but an idiot with a burnt tongue. He muttered a silent prayer to whoever was listening thanking them because no one was around to see him flounder at how hot the coffee was. Or so he thought.
smiles all around. Smiles and looks and blushes and hope.
Cas: don’t. I like it.
“No way no fucking way are you being serious right now?!” he said with almost a childish excitement.
“Well Castiel, seeing that my file won’t load, and you’ve already seen me embarrass myself twice, would you care to join me?” said Dean.
“Wait so the Medusa thing isn’t a rumour? You’re doing it?”
The second he laid eyes on the dark haired man, Dean froze. His breath hitched in his throat and everything seemed to move very slowly. His eyes grew wide. He was breathtaking. In a split second however, Dean regained his composure. But he noticed how a lock of hair fell down the man’s forehead, and the way his white coat fitted over his biceps. He also noticed how it made his stomach feel a very weird type of way. As the man walked forward, Deans eyes never left him. Who was he?
“what, Passage Du Grand Cerf?”
“Yeah, I’ll be right there. Professor mills wanted to talk to me.”
The look in Eileens eyes disappeared so quick Dean forgot it was ever there in the first place. She flashed him a wide grin. “I scheduled the meeting for 11am anyways, I knew you’d be late” she laughed.
“um. yeah?”
“Thank you charlie. Where would I be without you.”
Using his laptop as a cover, he took out his phone and messaged Cas.
“Yeah, but coffee was more important to you.” Dean chucked.
“See you in the evening,” Dean confirmed.
so many happy coincidences, oh and Dean was so happy about them.
• “s'installer” ~ “settle down”
Cas: shut up
Dean walked into the cafe hurriedly. He went up to the familiar woman behind the counter and greeted her with a smile.
Charlie: *sobs*
Sammy was 17 and boy he was smart as fuck. He wanted to be a lawyer and the day he told Dean about it, Dean felt so proud his heart could burst. Sam was no longer the scared little boy who held on tightly to Dean’s hand as they left their childhood home for good. Thank fuck for the presence of mind of 12-year-old Dean Winchester to take Sam and leave. The second he’d heard that bottle crash and John yell at Sammy, Dean didn’t even think twice. He grabbed the already packed bags and headed out to Bobby’s place, with Sam in tow. now 9 years later, John was rotting behind bars because of the countless offences he had committed, and they were with their real ‘dad’, Bobby Singer.
Where Henry was a good father, John was the shittiest one imaginable.
Dean: yeah.. but like, why?
“Charlie I don’t think we’re talking about the same thing anymore.”
Castiel and Eileen had known each other since they were both surgical interns here. They’d laughed together, cried together and grown together. Cas was so proud of how far shed come. From being the shy intern who barely spoke, to the bold and daring chief of surgery at NYMH, a position coveted by renowned surgeons all around the world.
“No no, Deans stepping in for him.”
He was thinking about Cas.
Dean: I can't wait x
“Cmon man, just admit that you’re a stalker. I promise I won’t turn you in”
No wonder ‘sonatine bureaucratique’ had been playing in his head ever since they said bye.
“Yeah, yeah, I’m right outside, I’ll see you in a few minutes.” he said, still not having gotten out of bed. Seeing the furious look on Eileen’s face he chuckled and hung up before she had the chance to yell at him some more.
“Yes, thank you.”
casti
“Yeah, Neuraforte is exactly what we need.” Cas replied.
Dean: IM LEAVING NOW
“You should get going now, I’m pretty sure Mr Lafitte and miss Talbot are waiting for you.” She said with a chuckle.
Fuck. She noticed. And by the looks of it, she also noticed the blush slowly creeping across deans cheeks.
Dean: if I hate it we’re never going there again
“Hey, Cas.”
The dark-haired boy had a deep, gravelly voice with just a hint of a French accent, but he was undoubtedly an American. Dean could tell because of how his French accent mingled with his American one and because when he spoke, he spoke the same way.
As he walked toward her, he caught sight of a tall, muscular, dark haired man standing not too far behind her, talking to a nurse.
Charlie: BOOTS
He was being too cool about this, with the number of butterflies in his stomach. Very unlike him, if the thought so himself.
Dean: shut up.
“Dateless and dead in a ditch probably.”
“BLAME TIMEZONES NOT ME”
Benny had picked up quite a few of his mannerisms as he just exhibited. Hearing him say ‘what is up my dude’ with heavily French accented English was really funny to dean.
“Yes, it is” came a reply.
“You bet,” Dean said, returning the laugh. “It’s like, anytime I mention Lawrence to anyone here, they always think I’m talking about a person!”
“Nothing... I was just wondering if you wanted to..”
Dean: Ok nerd, don’t stay up too late. and tell Jess I say hi next time you meet her.
He sat down on a chair facing her, in the now-familiar room. On the shelf behind her desk was a picture of her holding a small girls hand. Alex Mills. Next to that was a picture of her with her arm around a blond woman who had a younger Alex on her lap. Donna.
“Bye Dean,” said Castiel, a slow, shy smile creeping onto his face.
Sam: I was out with Jess in the evening so I’m doing my homework now.
“Good. Now as I was saying, we’re going to understand lighting, its effects and the meaning it can have on a film today. You might want to take a few notes, but most of it is covered in chapter 9 in your textbook. I have handouts if you’d like some extra information.”
“.... yeah”
“I love you too. And Dean, it’s going to be perfect.”
“Bonjour Dean, comment ça va?”
“Sorry professor, I must have missed that. What did you say?”
“Professor mills called on you, now unless you’re too busy...” he gestured down at deans phone with a wink
Cas: that changes today.
“D'accord alors. today we’re staring on a brand new topic in li-“
“It’s the greatest show ever created, I can't help it.”
Dean must have been staring at the projector blankly, his thoughts on Cas but he was trying not to show it when-
All his fears were put to rest after a class with Professor Mills. She didn’t treat her students like she was meeting them for the first time, she treated them as though she knew them for a lifetime. She took care of each person in class no matter how capable or not they were. Film took a whole new meaning for dean with her as his teacher.
Cas: so I’ll meet you outside the university at 6?
Dean: Talk soon, bitch.
Winchester Pharmaceuticals. The company his grandfather, Henry Winchester, had built from the ground up. He died before he could meet his grandkids, but left behind a son, who (gauging from what dean had heard about Henry) was nothing like his father. Where Henry was kind, John was cruel. Where Henry cared about the well being of other people, John cared only about money and himself.
Dean: So where are we going today
<1 new message from cas.>
“Stop it Dean, I’m not.”
He was cute. Very cute. With his dishevelled hair, his electric blue eyes, and his shy-but-not-so-shy manner, he was exactly Dean's type. The few rings he wore were an added benefit.
“Wait. did you say you’re from Lawrence?”
“Alright fine, you deserve it.”
“Next time, at least blow on it,” said the dark-haired boy.
The pair walked to Cas’ office, and as Cas was almost finishing his croissant Eileen said, “so, you remember Sam right?”
Cas: good. see you then.
“No more spilling coffee.” Dean agreed.
“Ok, you’re not wrong there. But anyway. To why do I owe this great pleasure.”
“Please, call me Cas.” Cas said softly.
“Of course, how could I forget your fiancé! How is he?” Cas asked, swallowing down the last of his meal.
Typical Charlie, always so enthusiastic and intuitive. More than deans best friend, deans little sister.
We meet Jody, Benny, Bela and Charlie in this one!! And also, dean gets something he’s wanted for a long time (2 things actually, but what they are is for you to find out :))
“Yeah, I know. Donna suggested it to me and it sounds like it was meant to be. Unless I find one even more fitting, that’s what it’ll be called”
Cas: okay then I’ll leave :(
“Dean and Castiel, sitting on a tree, k i s s-”
“Also, one more thing before you go. You seemed a bit distracted in class today. Is everything okay?”
“Hey so, are you free later today?” came Castiels voice.
“To what?”
“Well, Dean I mean he’s exactly your type.”
“How do you know him anyway?”
“CALL ME AFTER YOURE HOME. I WANT ALL THE DETAILS.”
“Ah, miss Talbot. So glad you could make it.” said professor Mills.
Eileen was frantically texting him, he was just about to reply when he was interrupted by a face time call.
“Today’s a big deal huh?” she asked.
Dean: I’m not going anywhere with you until you tell me why :(
“Judging by your accent and the flannel, I can tell you’re American. and you’re probably a UNI student. I am too” said Castiel.
Cas: okay, if you ask yourself why you said yes you’ll find your answer.
Dean: BOOTS OR LOAFERS TELL ME QUICK
Sam: Shut up Dean, don’t you have to study or something?!
• “va te faire foutre”~ “fuck you”
A dark-haired boy on a table across from him was laughing hard and failing miserably to cover it. Dean set down his coffee, hard, obviously spilling some onto himself in the process and that just caused the dark-haired boy to lose it even further.
Cas was already waiting for him. They were both early. He was sat on the steps of the main building, wearing a dark blue turtleneck with black pants. His eyes looked like small water worlds on a backdrop of white. water worlds that have seen civilisations rise and fall, seen and nurtured and felt everything. Two small little water worlds of hope, and happiness.
Castiel
“Oh and also, what're your pronouns Dean?”
“Castiel, I’m gonna stop you right there. I’m bisexual. And yes, I will go on a date with you.”
• “d'accord alors” ~ “okay then”
“So. What’s the word professor?”
Cas: I know we just met, but I asked you out because you’re cute and funny and interesting and I want to get to know you better. Is that enough or should I go on?
“Could you repeat it, please?” He said sheepishly and tried with his whole being to pay attention to what the professor was saying. He only registered some parts.
Dean, not quite registering the information Castiel just gave him, said
“Come in.” Came her muffled voice, from the other side. “Oh hello Dean, you’re right on time, take a seat.”
Dean wandered into class, the shadow of a smile still on his face. His mind was still at the cafe.
The second Cas looked into Deans eyes, his verdant and comforting eyes, a warm feeling washed over him. His hands started to tingle and his knees felt weak. A foreign feeling washed over him as dean still held his gaze and Cas clenched his jaw, trying to get a hold of himself.
Born and brought up in France, when they first met, Dean didn’t understand a word he said. Slowly, as they both grew used to each other and a friendship blossomed, they understood each other better.
The rest of the day passed by in a blur. Dean’s thoughts switched from the Medusa film to cas and back to the Medusa film again and then back to cas.
“I’m assuming you’ve heard I’m working on a  movie?”
His thoughts were interrupted as the car in front of him slowly started moving forward. “Finally” he muttered, shutting off the music, and putting his foot on the gas.
“I probably have to submit a paper in the afternoon but I should be free by 6. Why?” he said nonchalantly but his stomach was fluttering with excitement.
“Dean darling, aren’t you coming out for lunch with me and Benny?” Came belas voice.
Cas’ returning grin rivalled that of the moon.
He inhaled in anticipation
Dean huffed and took another sip of his coffee, this time (thankfully) not spilling anything. Then,
“No no that’s okay, they can wait a bit longer.”
“I’m not a stalker” he replied indignantly and goddamn he looked so fucking cute doing it.
A smirk crept onto the dark-haired boys face again. “So where are you from in the states? I’m from Lawrence, Kansas.” he said.
“I’m going to excuse your swearing just this once because I assume you’re excited, but yes. I am being serious.”
The very thought of him made Deans skin crawl. After his mother, Mary, had died, dean practically raised his kid brother Sam. When John married Kate Milligan, Dean was 6 and Sam was 2. With the arrival of Kate, things did change a bit and a few years later, Adam came along. Not soon after though, Kate got sick, really, really sick and she didn’t make it through. Things went back to the way they were before, except now Dean had to raise two kids despite being a kid himself. Dean didn’t mind though, he adored his brothers.
